So whenever I visit a schoolnand talk to students,,I always ask them the same thing:,Why do you Google?,Why is Google the search enginenof choice for you?,Strangely enough, I always getnthe same three answers.,One, "Because it works,",which is a great answer;nthat's why I Google, too.,Two, somebody will say,,"I really don't know of any alternatives.",It's not an equally great answernand my reply to that is usually,,"Try to Google the word 'search engine,',you may find a couplenof interesting alternatives.",And last but not least, thirdly,,inevitably, one student will raisenher or his hand and say,,"With Google, I'm certain to always getnthe best, unbiased search result.",Certain to always get the best,nunbiased search result. 
 Now, as a man of the humanities,,albeit a digital humanities man,,that just makes my skin curl,,even if I, too, realize that that trust,nthat idea of the unbiased search result,is a cornerstone in our collective lovenfor and appreciation of Google.,I will show you why that, philosophically,nis almost an impossibility. 
 But let me first elaborate,njust a little bit, on a basic principle,behind each search querynthat we sometimes seem to forget.,So whenever you set outnto Google something,,start by asking yourself this:n"Am I looking for an isolated fact?",What is the capital of France?,What are the building blocksnof a water molecule?,Great -- Google away.,There's not a group of scientistsnwho are this close to proving,that it's actually London and H30.,You don't see a big conspiracynamong those things.,We agree, on a global scale,,what the answers arento these isolated facts. 
 But if you complicate your questionnjust a little bit and ask something like,,"Why is therenan Israeli-Palestine conflict?",You're not exactly lookingnfor a singular fact anymore,,you're looking for knowledge,,which is something way morencomplicated and delicate.,And to get to knowledge,,you have to bring 10 or 20nor 100 facts to the table,and acknowledge them and say,n"Yes, these are all true.",But because of who I am,,young or old, black or white,ngay or straight,,I will value them differently.,And I will say, "Yes, this is true,,but this is more importantnto me than that.",And this is where it becomes interesting,,because this is where we become human.,This is when we startnto argue, to form society.,And to really get somewhere,nwe need to filter all our facts here,,through friends and neighborsnand parents and children,and coworkers and newspapersnand magazines,,to finally be grounded in real knowledge,,which is something that a search enginenis a poor help to achieve. 
 So, I promised you an examplenjust to show you why it's so hard,to get to the point of true, clean,nobjective knowledge --,as food for thought.,I will conduct a couple of simplenqueries, search queries.,We'll start with "Michelle Obama,",the First Lady of the United States.,And we'll click for pictures.,It works really well, as you can see.,It's a perfect searchnresult, more or less.,It's just her in the picture,nnot even the President. 
 How does this work?,Quite simple.,Google uses a lot of smartnessnto achieve this, but quite simply,,they look at two thingsnmore than anything.,First, what does it say in the captionnunder the picture on each website?,Does it say "Michelle Obama"nunder the picture?,Pretty good indicationnit's actually her on there.,Second, Google looks at the picture file,,the name of the file as suchnuploaded to the website.,Again, is it called "MichelleObama.jpeg"?,Pretty good indication it's notnClint Eastwood in the picture.,So, you've got those two and you getna search result like this -- almost. 
 Now, in 2009, Michelle Obamanwas the victim of a racist campaign,,where people set out to insult hernthrough her search results.,There was a picture distributednwidely over the Internet,where her face was distortednto look like a monkey.,And that picture was published all over.,And people published itnvery, very purposefully,,to get it up there in the search results.,They made sure to writen"Michelle Obama" in the caption,and they made sure to upload the picturenas "MichelleObama.jpeg," or the like.,You get why -- to manipulatenthe search result.,And it worked, too.,So when you picture-Googlednfor "Michelle Obama" in 2009,,that distorted monkey picturenshowed up among the first results. 
 Now, the results are self-cleansing,,and that's sort of the beauty of it,,because Google measures relevancenevery hour, every day.,However, Google didn't settlenfor that this time,,they just thought, "That's racistnand it's a bad search result,and we're going to go backnand clean that up manually.,We are going to writensome code and fix it,",which they did.,And I don't think anyone in this roomnthinks that was a bad idea.,Me neither. 
 But then, a couple of years go by,,and the world's most-Googled Anders,,Anders Behring Breivik,,did what he did.,This is July 22 in 2011,,and a terrible day in Norwegian history.,This man, a terrorist, blew upna couple of government buildings,walking distance from where we arenright now in Oslo, Norway,and then he travelednto the island of Utøya,and shot and killed a group of kids.,Almost 80 people died that day. 
 And a lot of people would describenthis act of terror as two steps,,that he did two things: he blew upnthe buildings and he shot those kids.,It's not true.,It was three steps.,He blew up those buildings,nhe shot those kids,,and he sat down and waitednfor the world to Google him.,And he preparednall three steps equally well. 
 And if there was somebodynwho immediately understood this,,it was a Swedish web developer,,a search engine optimization expertnin Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.,He's also a very political guy,and he was right out therenin social media, on his blog and Facebook.,And he told everybody,,"If there's something thatnthis guy wants right now,,it's to control the image of himself.,Let's see if we can distort that.,Let's see if we, in the civilized world,ncan protest against what he did,through insulting himnin his search results." 
 And how?,He told all of his readers the following,,"Go out there on the Internet,,find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --,find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --,publish them in your feeds,non your websites, on your blogs.,Make sure to write the terrorist'snname in the caption,,make sure to namenthe picture file "Breivik.jpeg.",Let's teach Google that that'snthe face of the terrorist.",And it worked.,Two years after that campaignnagainst Michelle Obama,,this manipulation campaignnagainst Anders Behring Breivik worked.,If you picture-Googled for him weeks afternthe July 22 events from Sweden,,you'd see that picture of dog poopnhigh up in the search results,,as a little protest. 
 Strangely enough, Googlendidn't intervene this time.,They did not step in and manuallynclean those search results up.,So the million-dollar question,,is there anything differentnbetween these two happenings here?,Is there anything different betweennwhat happened to Michelle Obama,and what happenednto Anders Behring Breivik?,Of course not.,It's the exact same thing,,yet Google intervened in one casenand not in the other. 
 Why?,Because Michelle Obamanis an honorable person, that's why,,and Anders Behring Breiviknis a despicable person.,See what happens there?,An evaluation of a person takes place,and there's only onenpower-player in the world,with the authority to say who's who.,"We like you, we dislike you.,We believe in you,nwe don't believe in you.,You're right, you're wrong.nYou're true, you're false.,You're Obama, and you're Breivik.",That's power if I ever saw it. 
 So I'm asking you to remembernthat behind every algorithm,is always a person,,a person with a set of personal beliefs,that no code can everncompletely eradicate.,And my message goesnout not only to Google,,but to all believers in the faithnof code around the world.,You need to identifynyour own personal bias.,You need to understand that you are human,and take responsibility accordingly. 
 And I say this because I believenwe've reached a point in time,when it's absolutely imperative,that we tie those bondsntogether again, tighter:,the humanities and the technology.,Tighter than ever.,And, if nothing else, to remind usnthat that wonderfully seductive idea,of the unbiased, clean search result,is, and is likely to remain, a myth. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 (Applause)Hi.,I want to talk about understanding,nand the nature of understanding,,and what the essence of understanding is,,because understanding is somethingnwe aim for, everyone.,We want to understand things.,My claim is that understanding has to do,with the ability to changenyour perspective.,If you don't have that,nyou don't have understanding.,So that is my claim. 
 And I want to focus on mathematics.,Many of us think of mathematicsnas addition, subtraction,,multiplication, division,,fractions, percent, geometry,nalgebra -- all that stuff.,But actually, I want to talknabout the essence of mathematics as well.,And my claim is that mathematicsnhas to do with patterns. 
 Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,,and this pattern actually emergesnjust from drawing circles,in a very particular way.,So my day-to-day definitionnof mathematics that I use every day,is the following:,First of all, it's about finding patterns.,And by "pattern," I mean a connection,na structure, some regularity,,some rules that govern what we see.,Second of all,,I think it is about representingnthese patterns with a language.,We make up language if we don't have it,,and in mathematics, this is essential.,It's also about making assumptions,and playing around with these assumptionsnand just seeing what happens.,We're going to do that very soon.,And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.,Mathematics enables usnto do so many things. 
 So let's have a look at these patterns.,If you want to tie a tie knot,,there are patterns.,Tie knots have names.,And you can also donthe mathematics of tie knots.,This is a left-out, right-in,ncenter-out and tie.,This is a left-in, right-out,nleft-in, center-out and tie.,This is a language we made upnfor the patterns of tie knots,,and a half-Windsor is all that.,This is a mathematics booknabout tying shoelaces,at the university level,,because there are patterns in shoelaces.,You can do it in so many different ways.,We can analyze it.,We can make up languages for it. 
 And representationsnare all over mathematics.,This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.,He invented a languagenfor patterns in nature.,When we throw something up in the air,,it falls down.,Why?,We're not sure, but we can representnthis with mathematics in a pattern. 
 This is also a pattern.,This is also an invented language.,Can you guess for what?,It is actually a notation systemnfor dancing, for tap dancing.,That enables him as a choreographernto do cool stuff, to do new things,,because he has represented it. 
 I want you to think about how amazingnrepresenting something actually is.,Here it says the word "mathematics.",But actually, they're just dots, right?,So how in the world can these dotsnrepresent the word?,Well, they do.,They represent the word "mathematics,",and these symbols also represent that word,and this we can listen to.,It sounds like this. 
 (Beeps) 
 Somehow these sounds representnthe word and the concept.,How does this happen?,There's something amazingngoing on about representing stuff. 
 So I want to talk aboutnthat magic that happens,when we actually represent something.,Here you see just linesnwith different widths.,They stand for numbersnfor a particular book.,And I can actually recommendnthis book, it's a very nice book. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just trust me. 
 OK, so let's just do an experiment,,just to play aroundnwith some straight lines.,This is a straight line.,Let's make another one.,So every time we move,nwe move one down and one across,,and we draw a new straight line, right?,We do this over and over and over,,and we look for patterns.,So this pattern emerges,,and it's a rather nice pattern.,It looks like a curve, right?,Just from drawing simple, straight lines. 
 Now I can change my perspectivena little bit. I can rotate it.,Have a look at the curve.,What does it look like?,Is it a part of a circle?,It's actually not a part of a circle.,So I have to continue my investigationnand look for the true pattern.,Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?,Well, no.,Perhaps I should extendnthe lines like this,,and look for the pattern there.,Let's make more lines.,We do this.,And then let's zoom outnand change our perspective again.,Then we can actually see thatnwhat started out as just straight lines,is actually a curve called a parabola.,This is represented by a simple equation,,and it's a beautiful pattern. 
 So this is the stuff that we do.,We find patterns, and we represent them.,And I think this is a nicenday-to-day definition.,But today I want to gona little bit deeper,,and think aboutnwhat the nature of this is.,What makes it possible?,There's one thingnthat's a little bit deeper,,and that has to do with the abilitynto change your perspective.,And I claim that whennyou change your perspective,,and if you take another point of view,,you learn something newnabout what you are watching,or looking at or hearing.,And I think this is a really importantnthing that we do all the time. 
 So let's just look atnthis simple equation,,x + x = 2 • x.,This is a very nice pattern,nand it's true,,because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.,We've seen this over and over,nand we represent it like this.,But think about it: this is an equation.,It says that somethingnis equal to something else,,and that's two different perspectives.,One perspective is, it's a sum.,It's something you plus together.,On the other hand, it's a multiplication,,and those are two different perspectives.,And I would go as far as to saynthat every equation is like this,,every mathematical equationnwhere you use that equality sign,is actually a metaphor.,It's an analogy between two things.,You're just viewing somethingnand taking two different points of view,,and you're expressing that in a language. 
 Have a look at this equation.,This is one of the mostnbeautiful equations.,It simply says that, well,,two things, they're both -1.,This thing on the left-hand side is -1,nand the other one is.,And that, I think, is onenof the essential parts,of mathematics -- you takendifferent points of view. 
 So let's just play around.,Let's take a number.,We know four-thirds.nWe know what four-thirds is.,It's 1.333, but we have to haventhose three dots,,otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.,But this is only in base 10.,You know, the number system,nwe use 10 digits.,If we change that aroundnand only use two digits,,that's called the binary system.,It's written like this.,So we're now talking about the number.,The number is four-thirds.,We can write it like this,,and we can change the base,nchange the number of digits,,and we can write it differently. 
 So these are all representationsnof the same number.,We can even write it simply,nlike 1.3 or 1.6.,It all depends onnhow many digits you have.,Or perhaps we just simplifynand write it like this.,I like this one, because this saysnfour divided by three.,And this number expressesna relation between two numbers.,You have four on the one handnand three on the other.,And you can visualize this in many ways.,What I'm doing now is viewing that numbernfrom different perspectives.,I'm playing around.,I'm playing around withnhow we view something,,and I'm doing it very deliberately.,We can take a grid.,If it's four across and three up,nthis line equals five, always.,It has to be like this.nThis is a beautiful pattern.,Four and three and five.,And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,,you've seen a lot of times.,This is your average computer screen.,800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200,is a television or a computer screen. 
 So these are all nice representations,,but I want to go a little bit furthernand just play more with this number.,Here you see two circles.nI'm going to rotate them like this.,Observe the upper-left one.,It goes a little bit faster, right?,You can see this.,It actually goes exactlynfour-thirds as fast.,That means that when it goesnaround four times,,the other one goes around three times.,Now let's make two lines, and drawnthis dot where the lines meet.,We get this dot dancing around. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this dot comes from that number.,Right? Now we should trace it.,Let's trace it and see what happens.,This is what mathematics is all about.,It's about seeing what happens.,And this emerges from four-thirds.,I like to say that thisnis the image of four-thirds.,It's much nicer -- (Cheers) 
 Thank you! 
 (Applause),This is not new.,This has been knownnfor a long time, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But this is four-thirds. 
 Let's do another experiment.,Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep) 
 This is a perfect A, 440Hz.,Let's multiply it by two.,We get this sound. (Beep) 
 When we play them together,nit sounds like this.,This is an octave, right?,We can do this game. We can playna sound, play the same A.,We can multiply it by three-halves. 
 (Beep) 
 This is what we call a perfect fifth. 
 (Beep) 
 They sound really nice together.,Let's multiply this soundnby four-thirds. (Beep) 
 What happens?,You get this sound. (Beep) 
 This is the perfect fourth.,If the first one is an A, this is a D.,They sound like this together. (Beeps) 
 This is the sound of four-thirds.,What I'm doing now,nI'm changing my perspective.,I'm just viewing a numbernfrom another perspective. 
 I can even do this with rhythms, right?,I can take a rhythm and playnthree beats at one time (Drumbeats) 
 in a period of time,,and I can play another soundnfour times in that same space. 
 (Clanking sounds) 
 Sounds kind of boring,nbut listen to them together. 
 (Drumbeats and clanking sounds) 
 (Laughter) 
 Hey! So. 
 (Laughter) 
 I can even make a little hi-hat. 
 (Drumbeats and cymbals) 
 Can you hear this?,So, this is the sound of four-thirds.,Again, this is as a rhythm. 
 (Drumbeats and cowbell) 
 And I can keep doing thisnand play games with this number.,Four-thirds is a really great number.nI love four-thirds! 
 (Laughter) 
 Truly -- it's an undervalued number.,So if you take a sphere and looknat the volume of the sphere,,it's actually four-thirdsnof some particular cylinder.,So four-thirds is in the sphere.nIt's the volume of the sphere. 
 OK, so why am I doing all this?,Well, I want to talk about what it meansnto understand something,and what we meannby understanding something.,That's my aim here.,And my claim is thatnyou understand something,if you have the ability to view itnfrom different perspectives.,Let's look at this letter.nIt's a beautiful R, right?,How do you know that?,Well, as a matter of fact,nyou've seen a bunch of R's,,and you've generalized,and abstracted all of thesenand found a pattern.,So you know that this is an R. 
 So what I'm aiming for herenis saying something,about how understandingnand changing your perspective,are linked.,And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,,and I can actually use thisnto teach something,,because when I give someone elsenanother story, a metaphor, an analogy,,if I tell a storynfrom a different point of view,,I enable understanding.,I make understanding possible,,because you have to generalizenover everything you see and hear,,and if I give you another perspective,nthat will become easier for you. 
 Let's do a simple example again.,This is four and three.nThis is four triangles.,So this is also four-thirds, in a way.,Let's just join them together.,Now we're going to play a game;nwe're going to fold it up,into a three-dimensional structure.,I love this.,This is a square pyramid.,And let's just take two of themnand put them together.,So this is what is called an octahedron.,It's one of the five platonic solids.,Now we can quite literallynchange our perspective,,because we can rotate itnaround all of the axes,and view it from different perspectives.,And I can change the axis,,and then I can view itnfrom another point of view,,but it's the same thing,nbut it looks a little different.,I can do it even one more time. 
 Every time I do this,nsomething else appears,,so I'm actually learningnmore about the object,when I change my perspective.,I can use this as a toolnfor creating understanding.,I can take two of thesenand put them together like this,and see what happens.,And it looks a little bitnlike the octahedron.,Have a look at it if I spinnit around like this.,What happens?,Well, if you take two of these,njoin them together and spin it around,,there's your octahedron again,,a beautiful structure.,If you lay it out flat on the floor,,this is the octahedron.,This is the graph structurenof an octahedron.,And I can continue doing this.,You can draw three great circlesnaround the octahedron,,and you rotate around,,so actually three great circlesnis related to the octahedron.,And if I take a bicycle pumpnand just pump it up,,you can see that this is alsona little bit like the octahedron.,Do you see what I'm doing here?,I am changing the perspective every time. 
 So let's now take a step back --,and that's actuallyna metaphor, stepping back --,and have a look at what we're doing.,I'm playing around with metaphors.,I'm playing aroundnwith perspectives and analogies.,I'm telling one story in different ways.,I'm telling stories.,I'm making a narrative;nI'm making several narratives.,And I think all of these thingsnmake understanding possible.,I think this actually is the essencenof understanding something.,I truly believe this. 
 So this thing about changingnyour perspective --,it's absolutely fundamental for humans.,Let's play around with the Earth.,Let's zoom into the ocean,nhave a look at the ocean.,We can do this with anything.,We can take the oceannand view it up close.,We can look at the waves.,We can go to the beach.,We can view the oceannfrom another perspective.,Every time we do this, we learnna little bit more about the ocean.,If we go to the shore,nwe can kind of smell it, right?,We can hear the sound of the waves.,We can feel salt on our tongues.,So all of thesenare different perspectives.,And this is the best one.,We can go into the water.,We can see the water from the inside.,And you know what?,This is absolutely essentialnin mathematics and computer science.,If you're able to viewna structure from the inside,,then you really learn something about it.,That's somehow the essence of something. 
 So when we do this,nand we've taken this journey,into the ocean,,we use our imagination.,And I think this is one level deeper,,and it's actually a requirementnfor changing your perspective.,We can do a little game.,You can imagine that you're sitting there.,You can imagine that you're up here,nand that you're sitting here.,You can view yourselves from the outside.,That's really a strange thing.,You're changing your perspective.,You're using your imagination,,and you're viewing yourselfnfrom the outside.,That requires imagination. 
 Mathematics and computer sciencenare the most imaginative art forms ever.,And this thing about changing perspectives,should sound a little bit familiar to you,,because we do it every day.,And then it's called empathy.,When I view the worldnfrom your perspective,,I have empathy with you.,If I really, truly understand,what the world looksnlike from your perspective,,I am empathetic.,That requires imagination.,And that is how we obtain understanding.,And this is all over mathematicsnand this is all over computer science,,and there's a really deep connectionnbetween empathy and these sciences. 
 So my conclusion is the following:,understanding something really deeply,has to do with the abilitynto change your perspective.,So my advice to you is:ntry to change your perspective.,You can study mathematics.,It's a wonderful way to train your brain.,Changing your perspectivenmakes your mind more flexible.,It makes you open to new things,,and it makes younable to understand things.,And to use yet another metaphor:,have a mind like water.,That's nice. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In India, we have these huge families.,I bet a lot of you allnmust have heard about it.,Which means that there arena lot of family events.,So as a child, my parentsnused to drag me to these family events. 
 But the one thingnthat I always looked forward to,was playing around with my cousins.,And there was always this one uncle,who used to be there,,always ready, jumping around with us,,having games for us,,making us kids have the time of our lives.,This man was extremely successful:,he was confident and powerful.,But then I saw this hale and hearty personndeteriorate in health.,He was diagnosed with Parkinson's. 
 Parkinson's is a disease that causesndegeneration of the nervous system,,which means that this personnwho used to be independent,suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,nbecause of tremors, much more difficult.,My uncle started using a walker to walk,,and to take a turn,,he literally had to takenone step at a time, like this,,and it took forever.,So this person, who used to benthe center of attention,in every family gathering,,was suddenly hiding behind people.,He was hiding from the pitiful looknin people's eyes. 
 And he's not the only one in the world.,Every year, 60,000 peoplenare newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,,and this number is only rising.,As designers, we dream that our designsnsolve these multifaceted problems,,one solution that solves it all,,but it need not always be like that.,You can also target simple problems,and create small solutions for themnand eventually make a big impact.,So my aim here wasnto not cure Parkinson's,,but to make their everyday tasksnmuch more simple,,and then make an impact. 
 Well, the first thing I targetednwas tremors, right?,My uncle told me that he had stoppedndrinking coffee or tea in public,just out of embarrassment,,so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.,It works just purely on its form.,The curve on top deflects the liquidnback inside every time they have tremors,,and this keeps the liquid insidencompared to a normal cup.,But the key here is that it is not taggednas a Parkinson's patient product.,It looks like a cup that could be usednby you, me, any clumsy person,,and that makes it much more comfortingnfor them to use, to blend in.,So, well, one problem solved,,many more to go. 
 All this while, I was interviewing him,,questioning him,,and then I realized that I was gettingnvery superficial information,,or just answers to my questions.,But I really needed to dig deepernto get a new perspective.,So I thought, well,nlet's observe him in his daily tasks,,while he's eating, while he's watching TV.,And then, when I was actuallynobserving him walking to his dining table,,it struck me, this man who finds itnso difficult to walk on flat land,,how does he climb a staircase?,Because in India we do not havena fancy rail that takes you up a staircase,like in the developed countries.,One actually has to climb the stairs.,So he told me,,"Well, let me show you how I do it.",Let's take a look at what I saw. 
 So he took really longnto reach this position,,and then all this while, I'm thinking,,"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?,Is he really, really going to do itnwithout his walker?",And then ... 
 (Laughter) 
 And the turns, he took them so easily. 
 So -- shocked?,Well, I was too.,So this person who could notnwalk on flat land,was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs. 
 On researching this, I realized thatnit's because it's a continuous motion.,There's this other mannwho also suffers from the same symptoms,and uses a walker,,but the moment he's put on a cycle,,all his symptoms vanish,,because it is a continuous motion.,So the key for me was to translatenthis feeling of walking on a staircase,back to flat land.,And a lot of ideasnwere tested and tried on him,,but the one that finally workednwas this one. Let's take a look. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 He walked faster, right? 
 (Applause) 
 I call this the staircase illusion,,and actually when the staircase illusionnabruptly ended, he froze,,and this is called freezing of gait.,So it happens a lot,,so why not have a staircase illusionnflowing through all their rooms,,making them feel much more confident?,You know, technology is not always it.,What we need are human-centered solutions.,I could have easilynmade it into a projection,,or a Google Glass, or something like that.,But I stuck to simple print on the floor.,This print could be taken into hospitals,to make them feel much more welcome. 
 What I wish to donis make every Parkinson's patient,feel like my uncle felt that day.,He told me that I made him feelnlike his old self again. 
 "Smart" in today's worldnhas become synonymous to high tech,,and the world is only gettingnsmarter and smarter day by day.,But why can't smart be somethingnthat's simple and yet effective?,All we need is a little bit of empathynand some curiosity,,to go out there, observe.,But let's not stop at that.,Let's find these complex problems.nDon't be scared of them.,Break them, boil them downninto much smaller problems,,and then find simple solutions for them.,Test these solutions, fail if needed,,but with newer insights to make it better.,Imagine what we all could donif we all came up with simple solutions.,What would the world be likenif we combined all our simple solutions?,Let's make a smarter world,nbut with simplicity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)"Where are you from?"nsaid the pale, tattooed man.,"Where are you from?",It's September 21, 2001,,10 days after the worst attacknon America since World War II.,Everyone wonders about the next plane.,People are looking for scapegoats.,The president, nthe night before, pledges to,"bring our enemies to justice nor bring justice to our enemies." 
 And in the Dallas mini-mart,,a Dallas mini-part surroundednby tire shops and strip joints,a Bangladeshi immigrant nworks the register.,Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyannwas a big man, an Air Force officer.,But he dreamed of a nfresh start in America.,If he had to work briefly in a mini-martnto save up for I.T. classes,and his wedding in two months, so be it. 
 Then, on September 21, nthat tattooed man enters the mart.,He holds a shotgun.,Raisuddin knows the drill:,puts cash on the counter.,This time, the man doesn't ntouch the money.,"Where are you from?" he asks.,"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.,His accent betrays him.,The tattooed man, a self-styledntrue American vigilante,,shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.,Raisuddin feels millions of beesnstinging his face.,In fact, dozens of scalding, nbirdshot pellets puncture his head. 
 Behind the counter, he lays in blood.,He cups a hand over his foreheadnto keep in the brains,on which he'd gambled everything.,He recites verses from the Koran,nbegging his God to live.,He senses he is dying. 
 He didn't die.,His right eye left him.,His fiancée left him.,His landlord, the mini-mart owner,nkicked him out.,Soon he was homeless and n60,000 dollars in medical debt,,including a fee for dialing nfor an ambulance.,But Raisuddin lived. 
 And years later, he would asknwhat he could do to repay his God,and become worthy of this second chance.,He would come to believe, in fact,,that this chance called for himnto give a second chance,to a man we might thinkndeserved no chance at all. 
 Twelve years ago, I was a fresh graduatenseeking my way in the world.,Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants,,I settled on the ultimate rebellion nagainst my parents,,moving to the country they had workednso damn hard to get out of.,What I thought might be a six-month stintnin Mumbai stretched to six years.,I became a writer and found myselfnamid a magical story:,the awakening of hope across muchnof the so-called Third World.,Six years ago, I returned to Americanand realized something:,The American Dream was thriving,,but only in India.,In America, not so much. 
 In fact, I observed that nAmerica was fracturing,into two distinct societies:,a republic of dreamsnand a republic of fears.,And then, I stumbled onto this nincredible tale of two lives,and of these two Americas that brutallyncollided in that Dallas mini-mart.,I knew at once I wanted to learn more,,and eventually that I would writena book about them,,for their story was the story nof America's fracturing,and of how it might be put back together. 
 After he was shot, Raisuddin's lifengrew no easier.,The day after admitting him,nthe hospital discharged him.,His right eye couldn't see.,He couldn't speak.,Metal peppered his face.,But he had no insurance, nso they bounced him.,His family in Bangladesh nbegged him, "Come home.",But he told them he had na dream to see about. 
 He found telemarketing work,,then he became an Olive Garden waiter,,because where better to get over his fearnof white people than the Olive Garden?,(Laughter),Now, as a devout Muslim,nhe refused alcohol,,didn't touch the stuff.,Then he learned that not selling itnwould slash his pay.,So he reasoned, like a budding nAmerican pragmatist,,"Well, God wouldn't want mento starve, would he?",And before long, in some months, nRaisuddin was that Olive Garden's,highest grossing alcohol pusher.,He found a man who taught himndatabase administration.,He got part-time I.T. gigs.,Eventually, he landed a six-figure jobnat a blue chip tech company in Dallas. 
 But as America begannto work for Raisuddin,,he avoided the classicnerror of the fortunate:,assuming you're the rule, nnot the exception.,In fact, he observed that many withnthe fortune of being born American,were nonetheless trapped in lives that nmade second chances like his impossible.,He saw it at the Olive Garden itself,,where so many of his colleagues hadnchildhood horror stories,of family dysfunction, chaos, naddiction, crime.,He'd heard a similar tale aboutnthe man who shot him,back when he attended his trial.,The closer Raisuddin got to the Americanhe had coveted from afar,,the more he realized there wasnanother, equally real, America,that was stingier with second chances.,The man who shot Raisuddin grew upnin that stingier America. 
 From a distance, Mark Stromannwas always the spark of parties,,always making girls feel pretty.,Always working, no matter what ndrugs or fights he'd had the night before.,But he'd always wrestled with demons.,He entered the world throughnthe three gateways,that doom so many young American men:,bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.,His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy,that she'd been just 50 dollars nshort of aborting him.,Sometimes, that little boy nwould be at school,,he'd suddenly pull a knife non his fellow classmates.,Sometimes that same little boynwould be at his grandparents',,tenderly feeding horses.,He was getting arrested before he shaved,,first juvenile, then prison.,He became a casual white supremacist,and, like so many around him, na drug-addled and absent father.,And then, before long,nhe found himself on death row,,for in his 2001 counter-jihad, nhe had shot not one mini-mart clerk,,but three.,Only Raisuddin survived. 
 Strangely, death row was nthe first institution,that left Stroman better.,His old influences quit him.,The people entering his life nwere virtuous and caring:,pastors, journalists, European pen-pals.,They listened to him, prayed with him,nhelped him question himself.,And sent him on a journey nof introspection and betterment.,He finally faced the hatred nthat had defined his life.,He read Viktor Frankl, nthe Holocaust survivor,and regretted his swastika tattoos.,He found God.,Then one day in 2011, n10 years after his crimes,,Stroman received news.,One of the men he'd shot, the survivor,nwas fighting to save his life. 
 You see, late in 2009,neight years after that shooting,,Raisuddin had gone on his own journey,na pilgrimage to Mecca.,Amid its crowds, nhe felt immense gratitude,,but also duty.,He recalled promising God, nas he lay dying in 2001,,that if he lived, he would serve nhumanity all his days.,Then, he'd gotten busy nrelaying the bricks of a life.,Now it was time to pay his debts.,And he decided, upon reflection,nthat his method of payment,would be an intervention nin the cycle of vengeance,between the Muslim and Western worlds.,And how would he intervene?,By forgiving Stroman publiclynin the name of Islam,and its doctrine of mercy.,And then suing the state of Texasnand its governor Rick Perry,to prevent them from executing Stroman,,exactly like most people nshot in the face do.,(Laughter) 
 Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired nnot only by faith.,A newly minted American citizen,nhe had come to believe that Stroman,was the product of a hurting America thatncouldn't just be lethally injected away.,That insight is what moved me nto write my book "The True American.",This immigrant begging America nto be as merciful to a native son,as it had been to an adopted one.,In the mini-mart, all those years earlier,,not just two men, nbut two Americas collided.,An America that still dreams, nstill strives,,still imagines that tomorrowncan build on today,,and an America that has resigned to fate,,buckled under stress and chaos,nlowered expectations,,an ducked into the oldest of refuges:,the tribal fellowship of one'snown narrow kind.,And it was Raisuddin, despitenbeing a newcomer,,despite being attacked,,despite being homeless and traumatized,,who belonged to that republic of dreams,and Stroman who belonged to that nother wounded country,,despite being born with the privilegenof a native white man. 
 I realized these men's stories formednan urgent parable about America.,The country I am so proud to call my own,wasn't living through a ngeneralized decline,as seen in Spain or Greece, nwhere prospects were dimming for everyone.,America is simultaneously the mostnand the least successful country,in the industrialized world.,Launching the world's best companies,,even as record numbers nof children go hungry.,Seeing life-expectancy dropnfor large groups,,even as it polishes nthe world's best hospitals.,America today is a sprightly young body,,hit by one of those strokes nthat sucks the life from one side,,while leaving the othernworryingly perfect. 
 On July 20, 2011, right after na sobbing Raisuddin,testified in defense of Stroman's life,,Stroman was killed by lethal injectionnby the state he so loved.,Hours earlier, when Raisuddin stillnthought he could still save Stroman,,the two men got to speak nfor the second time ever.,Here is an excerpt from their phone call.,Raisuddin: "Mark, you should know nthat I am praying for God,,the most compassionate and gracious.,I forgive you and I do not hate you.,I never hated you.",Stroman: "You are a remarkable person.,Thank you from my heart.,I love you, bro." 
 Even more amazingly, after the execution,,Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's neldest daughter, Amber,,an ex-convinct and an addict.,and offered his help.,"You may have lost a father,"nhe told her,,"but you've gained an uncle.",He wanted her, too, to have na second chance. 
 If human history were a parade,,America's float would be na neon shrine to second chances.,But America, generous with second chancesnto the children of other lands,,today grows miserly with first chancesnto the children of its own.,America still dazzles at allowingnanybody to become an American.,But it is losing its luster at allowingnevery American to become a somebody. 
 Over the last decade, seven millionnforeigners gained American citizenship.,Remarkable.,In the meanwhile, how many Americansngained a place in the middle class?,Actually, the net influx was negative.,Go back further, nand it's even more striking:,Since the 60s, the middle classnhas shrunk by 20 percent,,mainly because of the peoplentumbling out of it.,And my reporting around the countryntells me the problem is grimmer,than simple inequality.,What I observe is a pair of secessionsnfrom the unifying center of American life.,An affluent secession of up, up and away,,into elite enclaves of the educatednand into a global matrix,of work, money and connections,,and an impoverished secession nof down and out,into disconnected, dead-end lives,that the fortunate scarcely see. 
 And don't console yourself nthat you are the 99 percent.,If you live near a Whole Foods,,if no one in your family serves nin the military,,if you're paid by the year,nnot the hour,,if most people you know finished college,,if no one you know uses meth,,if you married once and remain married,,if you're not one of 65 million Americansnwith a criminal record --,if any or all of these things ndescribe you,,then accept the possibility that actually,,you may not know what's going on,and you may be part of the problem. 
 Other generations had to build na fresh society after slavery,,pull through a depression,ndefeat fascism,,freedom-ride in Mississippi.,The moral challenge of nmy generation, I believe,,is to reacquaint these two Americas,,to choose union over secession once again.,This ins't a problem we can taxnor tax-cut away.,It won't be solved by tweeting harder,nbuilding slicker apps,,or starting one more nartisanal coffee roasting service.,It is a moral challenge that begs neach of us in the flourishing America,to take on the wilting America as our own,,as Raisuddin tried to do. 
 Like him, we can make pilgrimages.,And there, in Baltimore and Oregon nand Appalachia,,find new purpose, as he did.,We can immerse ourselves nin that other country,,bear witness to its hopes and sorrows,,and, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.,What can you do?,What can you do?,What can we do?,How might we build na more merciful country? 
 We, the greatest inventors in the world,,can invent solutions to the problems nof that America, not only our own.,We, the writers and the journalists, ncan cover that America's stories,,instead of shutting down nbureaus in its midst.,We can finance that America's ideas,,instead of ideas from New York nand San Francisco.,We can put our stethoscopes to its backs,,teach there, go to court there,nmake there, live there, pray there. 
 This, I believe, is the calling nof a generation.,An America whose two halves learn again,to stride, to plow, to forge,nto dare together.,A republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,,begins with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Growing up, I didn't always understand,why my parents made menfollow the rules that they did.,Like, why did I really nhave to mow the lawn?,Why was homework really that important?,Why couldn't I put jelly beans nin my oatmeal? 
 My childhood was aboundnwith questions like this.,Normal things about being a kidnand realizing that sometimes,,it was best to listen to my parentsneven when I didn't exactly understand why.,And it's not that they didn't wantnme to think critically.,Their parenting always sought nto reconcile the tension,between having my siblings and Inunderstand the realities of the world,,while ensuring that we never acceptednthe status quo as inevitable. 
 I came to realize that this,nin and of itself,,was a very purposeful form of education.,One of my favorite educators,nBrazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,,speaks quite explicitlynabout the need for education,to be used as a tool for critical nawakening and shared humanity.,In his most famous book,n"Pedagogy of the Oppressed,",he states, "No one can be nauthentically human,while he prevents others from being so." 
 I've been thinking a lot about this nlately, this idea of humanity,,and specifically, who in this worldnis afforded the privilege,of being perceived as fully human.,Over the course of nthe past several months,,the world has watchednas unarmed black men, and women,,have had their lives takennat the hands of police and vigilante.,These events and all that nhas transpired after them,have brought me back to my own childhood,and the decisions that my parents madenabout raising a black boy in America,that growing up, I didn't alwaysnunderstand in the way that I do now. 
 I think of how hard it must have been,nhow profoundly unfair it must have felt,for them to feel like they had nto strip away parts of my childhood,just so that I could come home at night. 
 For example, I think of how one night,,when I was around 12 years old, on annovernight field trip to another city,,my friends and I bought Super Soakers,and turned the hotel parking lotninto our own water-filled battle zone.,We hid behind cars,,running through the darkness thatnlay between the streetlights,,boundless laughter ubiquitous nacross the pavement.,But within 10 minutes,,my father came outside, ngrabbed me by my forearm,and led me into our roomnwith an unfamiliar grip.,Before I could say anything,,tell him how foolish he had nmade me look in front of my friends,,he derided me for being so naive.,Looked me in the eye, nfear consuming his face,,and said, "Son, I'm sorry,,but you can't act the same nas your white friends.,You can't pretend to shoot guns.,You can't run around in the dark.,You can't hide behind anythingnother than your own teeth." 
 I know now how scared he must have been,,how easily I could have fallenninto the empty of the night,,that some man would mistake this water,for a good reason to washnall of this away. 
 These are the sorts of messages I've beenninundated with my entire life:,Always keep your hands where they ncan see them, don't move too quickly,,take off your hood when the sun goes down.,My parents raised me and my siblingsnin an armor of advice,,an ocean of alarm bells so someonenwouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,,so that they wouldn't makena memory of this skin.,So that we could be kids, nnot casket or concrete.,And it's not because they thought itnwould make us better than anyone else,it's simply because they wanted nto keep us alive. 
 All of my black friends were raisednwith the same message,,the talk, given to us nwhen we became old enough,to be mistaken for a nail readynto be hammered to the ground,,when people made our melaninnsynonymous with something to be feared. 
 But what does it do to a child,to grow up knowing that youncannot simply be a child?,That the whims of adolescencenare too dangerous for your breath,,that you cannot simply be curious,,that you are not afforded the luxurynof making a mistake,,that someone's implicit bias,might be the reason you don'tnwake up in the morning. 
 But this cannot be what defines us.,Because we have parentsnwho raised us to understand,that our bodies weren't meantnfor the backside of a bullet,,but for flying kites and jumping rope,nand laughing until our stomachs burst.,We had teachers who taught us nhow to raise our hands in class,,and not just to signal surrender,,and that the only thing we should give up,is the idea that we naren't worthy of this world.,So when we say that black lives matter,nit's not because others don't,,it's simply because we must affirm that wenare worthy of existing without fear,,when so many things tell us we are not.,I want to live in a world where my son,will not be presumed guiltynthe moment he is born,,where a toy in his hand isn't mistakennfor anything other than a toy. 
 And I refuse to accept that we can'tnbuild this world into something new,,some place where a child's name,doesn't have to be written non a t-shirt, or a tombstone,,where the value of someone's life,isn't determined by anything other nthan the fact that they had lungs,,a place where every single none of us can breathe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was growing up, I really nliked playing hide-and-seek a lot.,One time, though, I thought climbingna tree would lead to a great hiding spot,,but I fell and broke my arm.,I actually started first gradenwith a big cast all over my torso.,It was taken off six weeks later,nbut even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,,and I had to do physical therapynto flex and extend it,,100 times per day, seven days per week.,I barely did it, becausenI found it boring and painful,,and as a result, it took menanother six weeks to get better. 
 Many years later, my momndeveloped frozen shoulder,,which leads to painnand stiffness in the shoulder.,The person I believed for half of my lifento have superpowers,suddenly needed helpnto get dressed or to cut food.,She went each week to physical therapy,nbut just like me,,she barely followed the home treatment,,and it took hernover five months to feel better. 
 Both my mom and Inrequired physical therapy,,a process of doing a suitenof repetitive exercises,in order to regain the range of movementnlost due to an accident or injury.,At first, a physical therapistnworks with patients,,but then it's up to the patientsnto do their exercises at home.,But patients find physical therapynboring, frustrating, confusing,and lengthy before seeing results.,Sadly, patient noncompliancencan be as high as 70 percent.,This means the majority of patientsndon't do their exercises,and therefore takena lot longer to get better.,All physical therapists agreenthat special exercises,reduce the time needed for recovery,,but patients lacknthe motivation to do them. 
 So together with three friends,nall of us software geeks,,we asked ourselves,,wouldn't it be interesting if patientsncould play their way to recovery?,We started building MIRA,nA P.C. software platform,that uses this Kinect device,na motion capture camera,,to transform traditional exercisesninto video games. 
 My physical therapist has already set upna schedule for my particular therapy.,Let's see how this looks.,The first game asks mento fly a bee up and down,to gather pollen to deposit in beehives,,all while avoiding the other bugs.,I control the bee by doingnelbow extension and flexion,,just like when I was seven years oldnafter the cast was taken off. 
 When designing a game,nwe speak to physical therapists at first,to understand what movementnpatients need to do.,We then make that a video game,to give patients simple,nmotivating objectives to follow.,But the software is very customizable,,and physical therapists can alsoncreate their own exercises.,Using the software, my physical therapist,recorded herself performingna shoulder abduction,,which is one of the movementsnmy mom had to do,when she had frozen shoulder.,I can follow my therapist's examplenon the left side of the screen,,while on the right, I see myselfndoing the recommended movement.,I feel more engaged and confident,,as I'm exercising alongside my therapist,with the exercises my therapistnthinks are best for me.,This basically extends the applicationnfor physical therapists,to create whatever exercisesnthey think are best. 
 This is an auction house gamenfor preventing falls,,designed to strengthen musclesnand improve balance.,As a patient, I need to donsit and stand movements,,and when I stand up,,I bid for the items I want to buy.,(Laughter) 
 In two days, my grandmothernwill be 82 years old,,and there's a 50 percent chancenfor people over 80,to fall at least once per year,,which could lead to a broken hipnor even worse.,Poor muscle tone and impaired balancenare the number one cause of falls,,so reversing these problemsnthrough targeted exercise,will help keep older peoplenlike my grandmother,safer and independent for longer.,When my schedule ends,nMIRA briefly shows me,how I progressed throughout my session. 
 I have just shown younthree different games,for kids, adults and seniors.,These can be used with orthopedicnor neurologic patients,,but we'll soon have optionsnfor children with autism,,mental health or speech therapy.,My physical therapistncan go back to my profile,and see the data gatherednduring my sessions.,She can see how much I moved,nhow many points I scored,,with what speed I moved my joints,,and so on.,My physical therapist can use all of thisnto adapt my treatment. 
 I'm so pleased this version is now in use,in over 10 clinicsnacross Europe and the U.S.,,and we're working on the home version.,We want to enable physical therapistsnto prescribe this digital treatment,and help patients play their waynto recovery at home.,If my mom or I had a tool like thisnwhen we needed physical therapy,,then we would have been more successfulnfollowing the treatment,,and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell menwhat hardware is this,that they're rapidly putting away?,What is that made of,nand how much does it cost? 
 Cosmin Milhau: So it'sna Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,,but you just need a computernand a Kinect, which is 120 dollars. 
 TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thingnthat people use for their Xboxes,to do 3D games, right? 
 CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,nyou only need a camera. 
 TR: Right, so this is lessnthan a $1,000 solution. 
 CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,nyou can definitely use it. 
 TR: So right now, you're doingnclinical trials in clinics. 
 CM: Yes. 
 TR: And then the hope is to get itnso it's a home version,and I can do my exercise remotely,,and the therapist at the clinicncan see how I'm doing and stuff like that. 
 CM: Exactly. 
 TR: Cool. Thanks so much.nCM: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Mark Twain summed upnwhat I take to be,one of the fundamental problemsnof cognitive science,with a single witticism.,He said, "There's somethingnfascinating about science.,One gets such wholesalenreturns of conjecture,out of such a triflingninvestment in fact.",(Laughter) 
 Twain meant it as a joke,nof course, but he's right:,There's somethingnfascinating about science.,From a few bones, we infernthe existence of dinosuars.,From spectral lines,nthe composition of nebulae.,From fruit flies,,the mechanisms of heredity,,and from reconstructed imagesnof blood flowing through the brain,,or in my case, from the behaviornof very young children,,we try to say something aboutnthe fundamental mechanisms,of human cognition.,In particular, in my lab in the Departmentnof Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT,,I have spent the past decadentrying to understand the mystery,of how children learn so muchnfrom so little so quickly.,Because, it turns out thatnthe fascinating thing about science,is also a fascinatingnthing about children,,which, to put a gentlernspin on Mark Twain,,is precisely their abilitynto draw rich, abstract inferences,rapidly and accuratelynfrom sparse, noisy data.,I'm going to give younjust two examples today.,One is about a problem of generalization,,and the other is about a problemnof causal reasoning.,And although I'm going to talknabout work in my lab,,this work is inspired bynand indebted to a field.,I'm grateful to mentors, colleagues,nand collaborators around the world. 
 Let me start with the problemnof generalization.,Generalizing from small samples of datanis the bread and butter of science.,We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate,and we predict the outcomenof national elections.,We see how a handful of patientsnresponds to treatment in a clinical trial,,and we bring drugs to a national market.,But this only works if our samplenis randomly drawn from the population.,If our sample is cherry-pickednin some way --,say, we poll only urban voters,,or say, in our clinical trialsnfor treatments for heart disease,,we include only men --,the results may not generalizento the broader population. 
 So scientists care whether evidencenis randomly sampled or not,,but what does that have to do with babies?,Well, babies have to generalizenfrom small samples of data all the time.,They see a few rubber ducksnand learn that they float,,or a few balls and learn that they bounce.,And they develop expectationsnabout ducks and balls,that they're going to extendnto rubber ducks and balls,for the rest of their lives.,And the kinds of generalizationsnbabies have to make about ducks and balls,they have to make about almost everything:,shoes and ships and sealing waxnand cabbages and kings. 
 So do babies care whethernthe tiny bit of evidence they see,is plausibly representativenof a larger population?,Let's find out.,I'm going to show you two movies,,one from each of two conditionsnof an experiment,,and because you're going to seenjust two movies,,you're going to see just two babies,,and any two babies differ from each othernin innumerable ways.,But these babies, of course,nhere stand in for groups of babies,,and the differences you're going to see,represent average group differencesnin babies' behavior across conditions.,In each movie, you're going to seena baby doing maybe,just exactly what you mightnexpect a baby to do,,and we can hardly make babiesnmore magical than they already are.,But to my mind the magical thing,,and what I want you to pay attention to,,is the contrast betweennthese two conditions,,because the only thingnthat differs between these two movies,is the statistical evidencenthe babies are going to observe.,We're going to show babiesna box of blue and yellow balls,,and my then-graduate student,nnow colleague at Stanford, Hyowon Gweon,,is going to pull three blue ballsnin a row out of this box,,and when she pulls those balls out,nshe's going to squeeze them,,and the balls are going to squeak.,And if you're a baby,nthat's like a TED Talk.,It doesn't get better than that.,(Laughter),But the important point is it's reallyneasy to pull three blue balls in a row,out of a box of mostly blue balls.,You could do that with your eyes closed.,It's plausibly a random samplenfrom this population.,And if you can reach into a box at randomnand pull out things that squeak,,then maybe everything in the box squeaks.,So maybe babies should expectnthose yellow balls to squeak as well.,Now, those yellow ballsnhave funny sticks on the end,,so babies could do other thingsnwith them if they wanted to.,They could pound them or whack them.,But let's see what the baby does. 
 (Video) Hyowon Gweon: See this?n(Ball squeaks),Did you see that?n(Ball squeaks),Cool.,See this one?,(Ball squeaks),Wow. 
 Laura Schulz: Told you. (Laughs) 
 (Video) HG: See this one?n(Ball squeaks),Hey Clara, this one's for you.nYou can go ahead and play.,(Laughter) 
 LS: I don't even have to talk, right?,All right, it's nice that babiesnwill generalize properties,of blue balls to yellow balls,,and it's impressive that babiesncan learn from imitating us,,but we've known those things about babiesnfor a very long time.,The really interesting question,is what happens when we show babiesnexactly the same thing,,and we can ensure it's exactly the samenbecause we have a secret compartment,and we actually pull the balls from there,,but this time, all we changenis the apparent population,from which that evidence was drawn.,This time, we're going to show babiesnthree blue balls,pulled out of a boxnof mostly yellow balls,,and guess what?,You [probably won't] randomly drawnthree blue balls in a row,out of a box of mostly yellow balls.,That is not plausiblynrandomly sampled evidence.,That evidence suggests that maybe Hyowonnwas deliberately sampling the blue balls.,Maybe there's something specialnabout the blue balls.,Maybe only the blue balls squeak.,Let's see what the baby does. 
 (Video) HG: See this?n(Ball squeaks),See this toy?n(Ball squeaks),Oh, that was cool. See?n(Ball squeaks),Now this one's for you to play.nYou can go ahead and play. 
 (Fussing)n(Laughter) 
 LS: So you just sawntwo 15-month-old babies,do entirely different things,based only on the probabilitynof the sample they observed.,Let me show you the experimental results.,On the vertical axis, you'll seenthe percentage of babies,who squeezed the ball in each condition,,and as you'll see, babies are muchnmore likely to generalize the evidence,when it's plausibly representativenof the population,than when the evidencenis clearly cherry-picked.,And this leads to a fun prediction:,Suppose you pulled just one blue ballnout of the mostly yellow box.,You [probably won't] pull three blue ballsnin a row at random out of a yellow box,,but you could randomly samplenjust one blue ball.,That's not an improbable sample.,And if you could reach intona box at random,and pull out something that squeaks,nmaybe everything in the box squeaks.,So even though babies are going to seenmuch less evidence for squeaking,,and have many fewer actions to imitate,in this one ball condition than innthe condition you just saw,,we predicted that babies themselvesnwould squeeze more,,and that's exactly what we found.,So 15-month-old babies,nin this respect, like scientists,,care whether evidencenis randomly sampled or not,,and they use this to developnexpectations about the world:,what squeaks and what doesn't,,what to explore and what to ignore. 
 Let me show you another example now,,this time about a problemnof causal reasoning.,And it starts with a problemnof confounded evidence,that all of us have,,which is that we are part of the world.,And this might not seem like a problemnto you, but like most problems,,it's only a problem when things go wrong.,Take this baby, for instance.,Things are going wrong for him.,He would like to makenthis toy go, and he can't.,I'll show you a few-second clip.,And there's two possibilities, broadly:,Maybe he's doing something wrong,,or maybe there's somethingnwrong with the toy.,So in this next experiment,,we're going to give babiesnjust a tiny bit of statistical data,supporting one hypothesis over the other,,and we're going to see if babiesncan use that to make different decisions,about what to do. 
 Here's the setup.,Hyowon is going to try to makenthe toy go and succeed.,I am then going to try twicenand fail both times,,and then Hyowon is goingnto try again and succeed,,and this roughly sums up my relationshipnto my graduate students,in technology across the board.,But the important point here isnit provides a little bit of evidence,that the problem isn't with the toy,nit's with the person.,Some people can make this toy go,,and some can't.,Now, when the baby gets the toy,nhe's going to have a choice.,His mom is right there,,so he can go ahead and hand off the toynand change the person,,but there's also going to benanother toy at the end of that cloth,,and he can pull the cloth towards himnand change the toy.,So let's see what the baby does. 
 (Video) HG: Two, three. Go!n(Music),LS: One, two, three, go!,Arthur, I'm going to try again.nOne, two, three, go!,YG: Arthur, let me try again, okay?,One, two, three, go!n(Music),Look at that. Remember these toys?,See these toys? Yeah, I'm goingnto put this one over here,,and I'm going to give this one to you.,You can go ahead and play.,LS: Okay, Laura, but of course,nbabies love their mommies.,Of course babies give toysnto their mommies,when they can't make them work.,So again, the really important questionnis what happens when we change,the statistical data ever so slightly.,This time, babies are going to see the toynwork and fail in exactly the same order,,but we're changingnthe distribution of evidence.,This time, Hyowon is going to succeednonce and fail once, and so am I.,And this suggests it doesn't matternwho tries this toy, the toy is broken.,It doesn't work all the time.,Again, the baby's going to have a choice.,Her mom is right next to her,nso she can change the person,,and there's going to be another toynat the end of the cloth.,Let's watch what she does. 
 (Video) HG: Two, three, go!n(Music),Let me try one more time.nOne, two, three, go!,Hmm. 
 LS: Let me try, Clara.,One, two, three, go!,Hmm, let me try again.,One, two, three, go!n(Music),HG: I'm goingnto put this one over here,,and I'm going to give this one to you.,You can go ahead and play.,(Applause) 
 LS: Let me show younthe experimental results.,On the vertical axis,nyou'll see the distribution,of children's choices in each condition,,and you'll see that the distributionnof the choices children make,depends on the evidence they observe.,So in the second year of life,,babies can use a tiny bitnof statistical data,to decide between twonfundamentally different strategies,for acting in the world:,asking for help and exploring.,I've just shown yountwo laboratory experiments,out of literally hundreds in the fieldnthat make similar points,,because the really critical point,is that children's abilitynto make rich inferences from sparse data,underlies all the species-specificncultural learning that we do.,Children learn about new toolsnfrom just a few examples.,They learn new causal relationshipsnfrom just a few examples.,They even learn new words,nin this case in American Sign Language. 
 I want to close with just two points.,If you've been following my world,nthe field of brain and cognitive sciences,,for the past few years,,three big ideas will have comento your attention.,The first is that this isnthe era of the brain.,And indeed, there have beennstaggering discoveries in neuroscience:,localizing functionally specializednregions of cortex,,turning mouse brains transparent,,activating neurons with light.,A second big idea,is that this is the era of big datanand machine learning,,and machine learning promisesnto revolutionize our understanding,of everything from social networksnto epidemiology.,And maybe, as it tackles problemsnof scene understanding,and natural language processing,,to tell us somethingnabout human cognition.,And the final big idea you'll have heard,is that maybe it's a good idea we're goingnto know so much about brains,and have so much access to big data,,because left to our own devices,,humans are fallible, we take shortcuts,,we err, we make mistakes,,we're biased, and in innumerable ways,,we get the world wrong.,I think these are all important stories,,and they have a lot to tell usnabout what it means to be human,,but I want you to note that todaynI told you a very different story.,It's a story about minds and not brains,,and in particular, it's a storynabout the kinds of computations,that uniquely human minds can perform,,which involve rich, structured knowledgenand the ability to learn,from small amounts of data,nthe evidence of just a few examples.,And fundamentally, it's a storynabout how starting as very small children,and continuing out all the waynto the greatest accomplishments,of our culture,,we get the world right. 
 Folks, human minds do not only learnnfrom small amounts of data.,Human minds thinknof altogether new ideas.,Human minds generatenresearch and discovery,,and human minds generatenart and literature and poetry and theater,,and human minds take care of other humans:,our old, our young, our sick.,We even heal them.,In the years to come, we're goingnto see technological innovations,beyond anything I can even envision,,but we are very unlikely,to see anything even approximatingnthe computational power of a human child,in my lifetime or in yours.,If we invest in these most powerfulnlearners and their development,,in babies and children,and mothers and fathers,and caregivers and teachers,the ways we invest in our othernmost powerful and elegant forms,of technology, engineering and design,,we will not just be dreamingnof a better future,,we will be planning for one. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Laura, thank you.nI do actually have a question for you.,First of all, the research is insane.,I mean, who would designnan experiment like that? (Laughter),I've seen that a couple of times,,and I still don't honestly believenthat that can truly be happening,,but other people have donensimilar experiments; it checks out.,The babies really are that genius. 
 LS: You know, they look really impressivenin our experiments,,but think about what theynlook like in real life, right?,It starts out as a baby.,Eighteen months later,nit's talking to you,,and babies' first words aren't justnthings like balls and ducks,,they're things like "all gone,"nwhich refer to disappearance,,or "uh-oh," which refernto unintentional actions.,It has to be that powerful.,It has to be much more powerfulnthan anything I showed you.,They're figuring out the entire world.,A four-year-old can talk to younabout almost anything.,(Applause) 
 CA: And if I understand you right,nthe other key point you're making is,,we've been through these yearsnwhere there's all this talk,of how quirky and buggy our minds are,,that behavioral economicsnand the whole theories behind that,that we're not rational agents.,You're really saying that the biggernstory is how extraordinary,,and there really is genius therenthat is underappreciated. 
 LS: One of my favoritenquotes in psychology,comes from the socialnpsychologist Solomon Asch,,and he said the fundamental tasknof psychology is to remove,the veil of self-evidence from things.,There are orders of magnitudenmore decisions you make every day,that get the world right.,You know about objectsnand their properties.,You know them when they're occluded.nYou know them in the dark.,You can walk through rooms.,You can figure out what other peoplenare thinking. You can talk to them.,You can navigate space.nYou know about numbers.,You know causal relationships.nYou know about moral reasoning.,You do this effortlessly,nso we don't see it,,but that is how we get the world right,nand it's a remarkable,and very difficult-to-understandnaccomplishment. 
 CA: I suspect there are peoplenin the audience who have,this view of acceleratingntechnological power,who might dispute your statementnthat never in our lifetimes,will a computer do whatna three-year-old child can do,,but what's clear is that in any scenario,,our machines have so much to learnnfrom our toddlers.,LS: I think so. You'll have somenmachine learning folks up here.,I mean, you should never betnagainst babies or chimpanzees,or technology as a matter of practice,,but it's not justna difference in quantity,,it's a difference in kind.,We have incredibly powerful computers,,and they do do amazinglynsophisticated things,,often with very big amounts of data.,Human minds do, I think,nsomething quite different,,and I think it's the structured,nhierarchical nature of human knowledge,that remains a real challenge. 
 CA: Laura Schulz, wonderfulnfood for thought. Thank you so much. 
 LS: Thank you.n(Applause)Over the past 10 years,,I've been researching the waynpeople organize and visualize information.,And I've noticed an interesting shift. 
 For a long period of time,,we believed in a natural ranking ordernin the world around us,,also known as the great chain of being,nor "Scala naturae" in Latin,,a top-down structure that normally startsnwith God at the very top,,followed by angels, noblemen,,common people, animals, and so on.,This idea was actually basednon Aristotle's ontology,,which classified all things known to mannin a set of opposing categories,,like the ones you see behind me.,But over time, interestingly enough,,this concept adoptednthe branching schema of a tree,in what became knownnas the Porphyrian tree,,also considered to benthe oldest tree of knowledge. 
 The branching schemenof the tree was, in fact,,such a powerful metaphornfor conveying information,that it became, over time,nan important communication tool,to map a variety of systems of knowledge.,We can see trees being usednto map morality,,with the popular tree of virtuesnand tree of vices,,as you can see here, with these beautifulnillustrations from medieval Europe.,We can see trees being usednto map consanguinity,,the various blood ties between people.,We can also see trees being usednto map genealogy,,perhaps the most famous archetypenof the tree diagram.,I think many of you in the audiencenhave probably seen family trees.,Many of you probably even havenyour own family trees drawn in such a way.,We can see trees even mappingnsystems of law,,the various decrees and rulingsnof kings and rulers.,And finally, of course,nalso a very popular scientific metaphor,,we can see trees being usednto map all species known to man.,And trees ultimately becamensuch a powerful visual metaphor,because in many ways,nthey really embody this human desire,for order, for balance,nfor unity, for symmetry. 
 However, nowadays we are really facingnnew complex, intricate challenges,that cannot be understood by simplynemploying a simple tree diagram.,And a new metaphor is currently emerging,,and it's currently replacing the tree,in visualizing variousnsystems of knowledge.,It's really providing us with a new lensnto understand the world around us.,And this new metaphornis the metaphor of the network.,And we can see this shiftnfrom trees into networks,in many domains of knowledge. 
 We can see this shift in the waynwe try to understand the brain.,While before, we usednto think of the brain,as a modular, centralized organ,,where a given area was responsiblenfor a set of actions and behaviors,,the more we know about the brain,,the more we think of itnas a large music symphony,,played by hundredsnand thousands of instruments.,This is a beautiful snapshotncreated by the Blue Brain Project,,where you can see 10,000 neuronsnand 30 million connections.,And this is only mapping 10 percentnof a mammalian neocortex.,We can also see this shift in the waynwe try to conceive of human knowledge. 
 These are some remarkable treesnof knowledge, or trees of science,,by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.,And Llull was actually the precursor,,the very first one who creatednthe metaphor of science as a tree,,a metaphor we usenevery single day, when we say,,"Biology is a branch of science,",when we say,,"Genetics is a branch of science.",But perhaps the most beautiful of allntrees of knowledge, at least for me,,was created for the French encyclopedianby Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.,This was really the bastionnof the French Enlightenment,,and this gorgeous illustrationnwas featured as a table of contents,for the encyclopedia.,And it actually maps outnall domains of knowledge,as separate branches of a tree. 
 But knowledge is much morenintricate than this.,These are two maps of Wikipedianshowing the inter-linkage of articles --,related to history on the left,nand mathematics on the right.,And I think by looking at these maps,and other ones that have beenncreated of Wikipedia --,arguably one of the largest rhizomaticnstructures ever created by man --,we can really understandnhow human knowledge is much more intricate,and interdependent, just like a network. 
 We can also see this interesting shift,in the way we mapnsocial ties between people.,This is the typical organization chart.,I'm assuming many of you have seenna similar chart as well,,in your own corporations, or others.,It's a top-down structure,that normally startsnwith the CEO at the very top,,and where you can drill down all the waynto the individual workmen on the bottom.,But humans sometimes are, well, actually,nall humans are unique in their own way,,and sometimes you really don't play wellnunder this really rigid structure. 
 I think the Internet is really changingnthis paradigm quite a lot.,This is a fantastic mapnof online social collaboration,between Perl developers.,Perl is a famous programming language,,and here, you can seenhow different programmers,are actually exchanging files,nand working together on a given project.,And here, you can notice that this isna completely decentralized process --,there's no leader in this organization,,it's a network. 
 We can also see this interesting shiftnwhen we look at terrorism.,One of the main challengesnof understanding terrorism nowadays,is that we are dealing withndecentralized, independent cells,,where there's no leadernleading the whole process.,And here, you can actually seenhow visualization is being used.,The diagram that you see behind me,shows all the terrorists involvednin the Madrid attack in 2004.,And what they did here is,nthey actually segmented the network,into three different years,,represented by the vertical layersnthat you see behind me.,And the blue lines tie together,the people that were presentnin that network year after year.,So even though there's no leader per se,,these people are probably the mostninfluential ones in that organization,,the ones that know more about the past,,and the future plans and goalsnof this particular cell. 
 We can also see this shiftnfrom trees into networks,in the way we classifynand organize species.,The image on the rightnis the only illustration,that Darwin includednin "The Origin of Species,",which Darwin called the "Tree of Life.",There's actually a letternfrom Darwin to the publisher,,expanding on the importancenof this particular diagram.,It was critical for Darwin'sntheory of evolution.,But recently, scientists discoverednthat overlaying this tree of life,is a dense network of bacteria,,and these bacterianare actually tying together,species that were completelynseparated before,,to what scientists are now callingnnot the tree of life,,but the web of life, the network of life. 
 And finally, we can reallynsee this shift, again,,when we look at ecosystemsnaround our planet.,No more do we have these simplifiednpredator-versus-prey diagrams,we have all learned at school.,This is a much more accuratendepiction of an ecosystem.,This is a diagram creatednby Professor David Lavigne,,mapping close to 100 speciesnthat interact with the codfish,off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.,And I think here, we can really understandnthe intricate and interdependent nature,of most ecosystemsnthat abound on our planet. 
 But even though recent,nthis metaphor of the network,,is really already adoptingnvarious shapes and forms,,and it's almost becomingna growing visual taxonomy.,It's almost becomingnthe syntax of a new language.,And this is one aspectnthat truly fascinates me.,And these are actuallyn15 different typologies,I've been collecting over time,,and it really shows the immensenvisual diversity of this new metaphor.,And here is an example.,On the very top band,nyou have radial convergence,,a visualization model that has becomenreally popular over the last five years.,At the top left, the very first projectnis a gene network,,followed by a networknof IP addresses -- machines, servers --,followed by a network of Facebook friends.,You probably couldn't findnmore disparate topics,,yet they are using the same metaphor,nthe same visual model,,to map the never-ending complexitiesnof its own subject.,And here are a few more examplesnof the many I've been collecting,,of this growing visualntaxonomy of networks. 
 But networks are not justna scientific metaphor.,As designers, researchers, and scientistsntry to map a variety of complex systems,,they are in many ways influencingntraditional art fields,,like painting and sculpture,,and influencing many different artists.,And perhaps because networks haventhis huge aesthetical force to them --,they're immensely gorgeous --,they are really becoming a cultural meme,,and driving a new art movement,nwhich I've called "networkism.",And we can see this influencenin this movement in a variety of ways.,This is just one of many examples,,where you can see this influencenfrom science into art.,The example on your left sidenis IP-mapping,,a computer-generated map of IP addresses;nagain -- servers, machines.,And on your right side,,you have "Transient Structuresnand Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,,using oil and enamel on canvas.,And here are a few morenpaintings by Sharon Molloy,,some gorgeous, intricate paintings. 
 And here's another examplenof that interesting cross-pollination,between science and art.,On your left side,nyou have "Operation Smile.",It is a computer-generated mapnof a social network.,And on your right side,nyou have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,,using only graphite on paper.,Emma McNally is one of the mainnleaders of this movement,,and she creates these striking,nimaginary landscapes,,where you can really notice the influencenfrom traditional network visualization. 
 But networkism doesn't happennonly in two dimensions.,This is perhapsnone of my favorite projects,of this new movement.,And I think the title reallynsays it all -- it's called:,"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,,Like Droplets Along the Strandsnof a Spider's Web.",And I just find this particular projectnto be immensely powerful.,It was created by Tomás Saraceno,,and he occupies these large spaces,,creates these massive installationsnusing only elastic ropes.,As you actually navigate that spacenand bounce along those elastic ropes,,the entire network kind of shifts,nalmost like a real organic network would. 
 And here's yet another example,of networkism takennto a whole different level.,This was creatednby Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota,in a piece called "In Silence.",And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno,nfills these rooms with this dense network,,this dense web of elastic ropesnand black wool and thread,,sometimes including objects,nas you can see here,,sometimes even including people,nin many of her installations. 
 But networks are alsonnot just a new trend,,and it's too easy for usnto dismiss it as such.,Networks really embodynnotions of decentralization,,of interconnectedness, of interdependence.,And this new way of thinking is critical,for us to solve many of the complexnproblems we are facing nowadays,,from decoding the human brain,,to understandingnthe vast universe out there.,On your left side, you have a snapshotnof a neural network of a mouse --,very similar to our ownnat this particular scale.,And on your right side, you haventhe Millennium Simulation.,It was the largestnand most realistic simulation,of the growth of cosmic structure.,It was able to recreate the historynof 20 million galaxies,in approximately 25 terabytes of output.,And coincidentally or not,,I just find this particular comparison,between the smallest scalenof knowledge -- the brain --,and the largest scale of knowledge --nthe universe itself --,to be really quite strikingnand fascinating.,Because as Bruce Mau once said,,"When everything is connectednto everything else,,for better or for worse,neverything matters." 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I am in search of another planetnin the universe where life exists.,I can't see this planetnwith my naked eyes,or even with the most powerful telescopes,we currently possess.,But I know that it's there.,And understanding contradictionsnthat occur in nature,will help us find it. 
 On our planet,,where there's water, there's life.,So we look for planets that orbitnat just the right distance,from their stars.,At this distance,,shown in blue on this diagramnfor stars of different temperatures,,planets could be warm enoughnfor water to flow on their surfaces,as lakes and oceans,where life might reside.,Some astronomers focus their timenand energy on finding planets,at these distances from their stars.,What I do picks up where their job ends.,I model the possiblenclimates of exoplanets.,And here's why that's important:,there are many factorsnbesides distance from its star,that control whetherna planet can support life. 
 Take the planet Venus.,It's named after the Roman goddessnof love and beauty,,because of its benign,nethereal appearance in the sky.,But spacecraft measurementsnrevealed a different story.,The surface temperature is closento 900 degrees Fahrenheit,,500 Celsius.,That's hot enough to melt lead.,Its thick atmosphere, not its distancenfrom the sun, is the reason.,It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,,trapping heat from the sunnand scorching the planet's surface.,The reality totally contradictedninitial perceptions of this planet.,From these lessonsnfrom our own solar system,,we've learned that a planet's atmosphere,is crucial to its climatenand potential to host life. 
 We don't know what the atmospheresnof these planets are like,because the planets are so smallnand dim compared to their stars,and so far away from us.,For example, one of the closest planetsnthat could support surface water --,it's called Gliese 667 Cc --,such a glamorous name, right,nnice phone number for a name --,it's 23 light years away.,So that's more than 100 trillion miles.,Trying to measurenthe atmospheric composition,of an exoplanet passingnin front of its host star is hard.,It's like trying to see a fruit fly,passing in front of a car's headlight.,OK, now imagine that carnis 100 trillion miles away,,and you want to knownthe precise color of that fly. 
 So I use computer models,to calculate the kind of atmospherena planet would need,to have a suitable climatenfor water and life. 
 Here's an artist's conceptnof the planet Kepler-62f,,with the Earth for reference.,It's 1,200 light years away,,and just 40 percent larger than Earth.,Our NSF-funded work found that itncould be warm enough for open water,from many types of atmospheresnand orientations of its orbit.,So I'd like future telescopesnto follow up on this planet,to look for signs of life. 
 Ice on a planet's surfacenis also important for climate.,Ice absorbs longer,nredder wavelengths of light,,and reflects shorter, bluer light.,That's why the icebergnin this photo looks so blue.,The redder light from the sunnis absorbed on its way through the ice.,Only the blue lightnmakes it all the way to the bottom.,Then it gets reflectednback to up to our eyes,and we see blue ice.,My models show that planetsnorbiting cooler stars,could actually be warmernthan planets orbiting hotter stars.,There's another contradiction --,that ice absorbs the longernwavelength light from cooler stars,,and that light, that energy,nheats the ice. 
 Using climate models to explore,how these contradictionsncan affect planetary climate,is vital to the search for life elsewhere. 
 And it's no surprisenthat this is my specialty.,I'm an African-American female astronomer,and a classically trained actor,who loves to wear makeupnand read fashion magazines,,so I am uniquely positioned to appreciatencontradictions in nature -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 ... and how they can inform our searchnfor the next planet where life exists. 
 My organization, Rising Stargirls,,teaches astronomynto middle-school girls of color,,using theater, writing and visual art.,That's another contradiction --nscience and art don't often go together,,but interweaving them can helpnthese girls bring their whole selves,to what they learn,,and maybe one day joinnthe ranks of astronomers,who are full of contradictions,,and use their backgroundsnto discover, once and for all,,that we are truly not alonenin the universe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So in 1885, Karl Benzninvented the automobile.,Later that year, he took it outnfor the first public test drive,,and -- true story --ncrashed into a wall.,For the last 130 years,,we've been working around that leastnreliable part of the car, the driver.,We've made the car stronger.,We've added seat belts,nwe've added air bags,,and in the last decade, we've actuallynstarted trying to make the car smarter,to fix that bug, the driver. 
 Now, today I'm going to talk to youna little bit about the difference,between patching around the problemnwith driver assistance systems,and actually having fullynself-driving cars,and what they can do for the world.,I'm also going to talk to youna little bit about our car,and allow you to see how it sees the worldnand how it reacts and what it does,,but first I'm going to talkna little bit about the problem.,And it's a big problem:,1.2 million people are killednon the world's roads every year.,In America alone, 33,000 peoplenare killed each year.,To put that in perspective,,that's the same as a 737nfalling out of the sky every working day.,It's kind of unbelievable.,Cars are sold to us like this,,but really, this is what driving's like.,Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy,,and you want to do anythingnother than drive.,And the reason why is this:,Traffic is getting worse.,In America, between 1990 and 2010,,the vehicle miles travelednincreased by 38 percent.,We grew by six percent of roads,,so it's not in your brains.,Traffic really is substantially worsenthan it was not very long ago. 
 And all of this has a very human cost.,So if you take the average commute timenin America, which is about 50 minutes,,you multiply that by the 120 millionnworkers we have,,that turns out to benabout six billion minutes,wasted in commuting every day.,Now, that's a big number,nso let's put it in perspective.,You take that six billion minutes,and you divide it by the averagenlife expectancy of a person,,that turns out to be 162 lifetimes,spent every day, wasted,,just getting from A to B.,It's unbelievable.,And then, there are those of usnwho don't have the privilege,of sitting in traffic.,So this is Steve.,He's an incredibly capable guy,,but he just happens to be blind,,and that means instead of a 30-minutendrive to work in the morning,,it's a two-hour ordealnof piecing together bits of public transit,or asking friends and family for a ride.,He doesn't have that same freedomnthat you and I have to get around.,We should do something about that. 
 Now, conventional wisdom would say,that we'll just takenthese driver assistance systems,and we'll kind of push themnand incrementally improve them,,and over time, they'll turnninto self-driving cars.,Well, I'm here to tell younthat's like me saying,that if I work really hard at jumping,none day I'll be able to fly.,We actually need to donsomething a little different.,And so I'm going to talk to younabout three different ways,that self-driving systems are differentnthan driver assistance systems.,And I'm going to startnwith some of our own experience. 
 So back in 2013,,we had the first testnof a self-driving car,where we let regular people use it.,Well, almost regular --nthey were 100 Googlers,,but they weren't working on the project.,And we gave them the car and we allowednthem to use it in their daily lives.,But unlike a real self-driving car,nthis one had a big asterisk with it:,They had to pay attention,,because this was an experimental vehicle.,We tested it a lot,nbut it could still fail.,And so we gave them two hours of training,,we put them in the car,nwe let them use it,,and what we heard backnwas something awesome,,as someone tryingnto bring a product into the world.,Every one of them told us they loved it.,In fact, we had a Porsche drivernwho came in and told us on the first day,,"This is completely stupid.nWhat are we thinking?",But at the end of it, he said,n"Not only should I have it,,everyone else should have it,nbecause people are terrible drivers.",So this was music to our ears,,but then we started to look at whatnthe people inside the car were doing,,and this was eye-opening.,Now, my favorite story is this gentleman,who looks down at his phonenand realizes the battery is low,,so he turns around like this in the carnand digs around in his backpack,,pulls out his laptop,,puts it on the seat,,goes in the back again,,digs around, pulls outnthe charging cable for his phone,,futzes around, puts it into the laptop,nputs it on the phone.,Sure enough, the phone is charging.,All the time he's been doingn65 miles per hour down the freeway.,Right? Unbelievable.,So we thought about this and we said,nit's kind of obvious, right?,The better the technology gets,,the less reliablenthe driver is going to get.,So by just making the carsnincrementally smarter,,we're probably not going to seenthe wins we really need. 
 Let me talk about somethingna little technical for a moment here.,So we're looking at this graph,nand along the bottom,is how often does the carnapply the brakes when it shouldn't.,You can ignore most of that axis,,because if you're driving around town,nand the car starts stopping randomly,,you're never going to buy that car.,And the vertical axis is how oftennthe car is going to apply the brakes,when it's supposed tonto help you avoid an accident.,Now, if we look atnthe bottom left corner here,,this is your classic car.,It doesn't apply the brakes for you,nit doesn't do anything goofy,,but it also doesn't get younout of an accident.,Now, if we want to bringna driver assistance system into a car,,say with collision mitigation braking,,we're going to put some packagenof technology on there,,and that's this curve, and it's goingnto have some operating properties,,but it's never going to avoidnall of the accidents,,because it doesn't have that capability.,But we'll pick some placenalong the curve here,,and maybe it avoids half of accidentsnthat the human driver misses,,and that's amazing, right?,We just reduced accidents on our roadsnby a factor of two.,There are now 17,000 less peoplendying every year in America. 
 But if we want a self-driving car,,we need a technology curventhat looks like this.,We're going to have to putnmore sensors in the vehicle,,and we'll pick somenoperating point up here,where it basically neverngets into a crash.,They'll happen, but very low frequency.,Now you and I could look at thisnand we could argue,about whether it's incremental, andnI could say something like "80-20 rule,",and it's really hard to move upnto that new curve.,But let's look at itnfrom a different direction for a moment.,So let's look at how oftennthe technology has to do the right thing.,And so this green dot up herenis a driver assistance system.,It turns out that human drivers,make mistakes that leadnto traffic accidents,about once every 100,000 miles in America.,In contrast, a self-driving systemnis probably making decisions,about 10 times per second,,so order of magnitude,,that's about 1,000 times per mile.,So if you compare the distancenbetween these two,,it's about 10 to the eighth, right?,Eight orders of magnitude.,That's like comparing how fast I run,to the speed of light.,It doesn't matter how hard I train,nI'm never actually going to get there.,So there's a pretty big gap there. 
 And then finally, there's hownthe system can handle uncertainty.,So this pedestrian here might benstepping into the road, might not be.,I can't tell,nnor can any of our algorithms,,but in the case ofna driver assistance system,,that means it can't take action,nbecause again,,if it presses the brakes unexpectedly,nthat's completely unacceptable.,Whereas a self-driving systemncan look at that pedestrian and say,,I don't know what they're about to do,,slow down, take a better look,nand then react appropriately after that. 
 So it can be much safer thanna driver assistance system can ever be.,So that's enough aboutnthe differences between the two.,Let's spend some time talking aboutnhow the car sees the world. 
 So this is our vehicle.,It starts by understandingnwhere it is in the world,,by taking a map and its sensor datanand aligning the two,,and then we layer on top of thatnwhat it sees in the moment.,So here, all the purple boxes you can seenare other vehicles on the road,,and the red thing on the sidenover there is a cyclist,,and up in the distance,nif you look really closely,,you can see some cones.,Then we know where the carnis in the moment,,but we have to do better than that:nwe have to predict what's going to happen.,So here the pickup truck in top rightnis about to make a left lane change,because the road in front of it is closed,,so it needs to get out of the way.,Knowing that one pickup truck is great,,but we really need to knownwhat everybody's thinking,,so it becomes quite a complicated problem.,And then given that, we can figure outnhow the car should respond in the moment,,so what trajectory it should follow, hownquickly it should slow down or speed up.,And then that all turns intonjust following a path:,turning the steering wheel left or right,npressing the brake or gas.,It's really just two numbersnat the end of the day.,So how hard can it really be? 
 Back when we started in 2009,,this is what our system looked like.,So you can see our car in the middlenand the other boxes on the road,,driving down the highway.,The car needs to understand where it isnand roughly where the other vehicles are.,It's really a geometricnunderstanding of the world.,Once we started drivingnon neighborhood and city streets,,the problem becomes a wholennew level of difficulty.,You see pedestrians crossing in frontnof us, cars crossing in front of us,,going every which way,,the traffic lights, crosswalks.,It's an incredibly complicatednproblem by comparison.,And then once you haventhat problem solved,,the vehicle has to be ablento deal with construction.,So here are the cones on the leftnforcing it to drive to the right,,but not just constructionnin isolation, of course.,It has to deal with other people movingnthrough that construction zone as well.,And of course, if anyone'snbreaking the rules, the police are there,and the car has to understand thatnthat flashing light on the top of the car,means that it's not just a car,nit's actually a police officer.,Similarly, the orange boxnon the side here,,it's a school bus,,and we have to treat thatndifferently as well. 
 When we're out on the road,nother people have expectations:,So, when a cyclist puts up their arm,,it means they're expecting the carnto yield to them and make room for them,to make a lane change.,And when a police officernstood in the road,,our vehicle should understandnthat this means stop,,and when they signal to go,nwe should continue. 
 Now, the way we accomplish thisnis by sharing data between the vehicles.,The first, most crude model of this,is when one vehiclensees a construction zone,,having another know about itnso it can be in the correct lane,to avoid some of the difficulty.,But we actually have a muchndeeper understanding of this.,We could take all of the datanthat the cars have seen over time,,the hundreds of thousandsnof pedestrians, cyclists,,and vehicles that have been out there,and understand what they look like,and use that to infernwhat other vehicles should look like,and other pedestrians should look like.,And then, even more importantly,nwe could take from that a model,of how we expect themnto move through the world.,So here the yellow box is a pedestrianncrossing in front of us.,Here the blue box is a cyclistnand we anticipate,that they're going to nudge outnand around the car to the right.,Here there's a cyclistncoming down the road,and we know they're going to continuento drive down the shape of the road.,Here somebody makes a right turn,,and in a moment here, somebody'sngoing to make a U-turn in front of us,,and we can anticipate that behaviornand respond safely. 
 Now, that's all well and goodnfor things that we've seen,,but of course, you encounternlots of things that you haven't,seen in the world before.,And so just a couple of months ago,,our vehicles were drivingnthrough Mountain View,,and this is what we encountered.,This is a woman in an electric wheelchair,chasing a duck in circles on the road.n(Laughter),Now it turns out, there is nowherenin the DMV handbook,that tells you how to deal with that,,but our vehicles were ablento encounter that,,slow down, and drive safely.,Now, we don't have to dealnwith just ducks.,Watch this bird fly across in front of us.nThe car reacts to that.,Here we're dealing with a cyclist,that you would never expect to seenanywhere other than Mountain View.,And of course, we havento deal with drivers,,even the very small ones.,Watch to the right as someonenjumps out of this truck at us.,And now, watch the left as the carnwith the green box decides,he needs to make a right turnnat the last possible moment.,Here, as we make a lane change,nthe car to our left decides,it wants to as well.,And here, we watch a carnblow through a red light,and yield to it.,And similarly, here, a cyclistnblowing through that light as well.,And of course,nthe vehicle responds safely.,And of course, we have peoplenwho do I don't know what,sometimes on the road, like this guynpulling out between two self-driving cars.,You have to ask, "What are you thinking?",(Laughter) 
 Now, I just fire-hosed younwith a lot of stuff there,,so I'm going to break one of thesendown pretty quickly.,So what we're looking at is the scenenwith the cyclist again,,and you might notice in the bottom,nwe can't actually see the cyclist yet,,but the car can: it's that littlenblue box up there,,and that comes from the laser data.,And that's not actuallynreally easy to understand,,so what I'm going to do is I'm goingnto turn that laser data and look at it,,and if you're really good at lookingnat laser data, you can see,a few dots on the curve there,,right there, and that blue boxnis that cyclist.,Now as our light is red,,the cyclist's lightnhas turned yellow already,,and if you squint, you can see thatnin the imagery.,But the cyclist, we see, is goingnto proceed through the intersection.,Our light has now turned green,nhis is solidly red,,and we now anticipate that this bikenis going to come all the way across.,Unfortunately the other drivers next to usnwere not paying as much attention.,They started to pull forward,nand fortunately for everyone,,this cyclists reacts, avoids,,and makes it through the intersection.,And off we go. 
 Now, as you can see, we've madensome pretty exciting progress,,and at this point we're pretty convinced,this technology is goingnto come to market.,We do three million miles of testingnin our simulators every single day,,so you can imagine the experiencenthat our vehicles have.,We are looking forward to havingnthis technology on the road,,and we think the right pathnis to go through the self-driving,rather than driver assistance approach,because the urgency is so large.,In the time I have given this talk today,,34 people have died on America's roads. 
 How soon can we bring it out?,Well, it's hard to say becausenit's a really complicated problem,,but these are my two boys.,My oldest son is 11, and that meansnin four and a half years,,he's going to be ablento get his driver's license.,My team and I are committednto making sure that doesn't happen. 
 Thank you. 
 (Laughter) (Applause),Chris Anderson: Chris,nI've got a question for you. 
 Chris Urmson: Sure. 
 CA: So certainly, the mind of your carsnis pretty mind-boggling.,On this debate betweenndriver-assisted and fully driverless --,I mean, there's a real debatengoing on out there right now.,So some of the companies,nfor example, Tesla,,are going the driver-assisted route.,What you're saying is thatnthat's kind of going to be a dead end,because you can't just keep improvingnthat route and get to fully driverless,at some point, and then a drivernis going to say, "This feels safe,",and climb into the back,nand something ugly will happen. 
 CU: Right. No, that's exactly right,nand it's not to say,that the driver assistance systemsnaren't going to be incredibly valuable.,They can save a lot of livesnin the interim,,but to see the transformative opportunitynto help someone like Steve get around,,to really get to the end case in safety,,to have the opportunitynto change our cities,and move parking out and get rid ofnthese urban craters we call parking lots,,it's the only way to go. 
 CA: We will be tracking your progressnwith huge interest.,Thanks so much, Chris.nCU: Thank you. (Applause)What I'd like to donis talk to you a little bit about fear,and the cost of fear,and the age of fearnfrom which we are now emerging.,I would like you to feel comfortablenwith my doing that,by letting you know that I know somethingnabout fear and anxiety.,I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey. 
 (Laughter) 
 I could worry before I could walk. 
 (Laughter) 
 Please, applaud that. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 But I also grew up in a timenwhere there was something to fear.,We were brought out in the hallnwhen I was a little kid,and taught how to putnour coats over our heads,to protect us from globalnthermonuclear war.,Now even my seven-year-old brainnknew that wasn't going to work.,But I also knew,that global thermonuclear warnwas something to be concerned with. 
 And yet, despite the factnthat we lived for 50 years,with the threat of such a war,,the response of our governmentnand of our society,was to do wonderful things.,We created the space programnin response to that.,We built our highway systemnin response to that.,We created the Internetnin response to that.,So sometimes fear can producena constructive response.,But sometimes it can producenan un-constructive response. 
 On September 11, 2001,,19 guys took over four airplanes,and flew them into a couple of buildings.,They exacted a horrible toll.,It is not for us to minimizenwhat that toll was.,But the response that we hadnwas clearly disproportionate --,disproportionate to the pointnof verging on the unhinged.,We rearranged the national securitynapparatus of the United States,and of many governments,to address a threat that,nat the time that those attacks took place,,was quite limited.,In fact, according to ournintelligence services,,on September 11, 2001,,there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.,There were just a few thousand terrorists.,They posed an existential threat,to no one. 
 But we rearranged our entirennational security apparatus,in the most sweeping waynsince the end of the Second World War.,We launched two wars.,We spent trillions of dollars.,We suspended our values.,We violated international law.,We embraced torture.,We embraced the idea,that if these 19 guys could do this,nanybody could do it.,And therefore,nfor the first time in history,,we were seeing everybody as a threat.,And what was the result of that?,Surveillance programs that listened innon the emails and phone calls,of entire countries --,hundreds of millions of people --,setting aside whethernthose countries were our allies,,setting aside what our interests were.,I would argue that 15 years later,,since today there are more terrorists,,more terrorist attacks,nmore terrorist casualties --,this by the countnof the U.S. State Department --,since today the regionnfrom which those attacks emanate,is more unstablenthan at any time in its history,,since the Flood, perhaps,,we have not succeeded in our response. 
 Now you have to ask,nwhere did we go wrong?,What did we do?nWhat was the mistake that was made?,And you might say, well look,nWashington is a dysfunctional place.,There are political food fights.,We've turned our discourseninto a cage match.,And that's true.,But there are bigger problems,nbelieve it or not, than that dysfunction,,even though I would argue,that dysfunction that makes it impossiblento get anything done,in the richest and most powerfulncountry in the world,is far more dangerous than anythingnthat a group like ISIS could do,,because it stops us in our tracksnand it keeps us from progress. 
 But there are other problems.,And the other problems,came from the fact that in Washingtonnand in many capitals right now,,we're in a creativity crisis.,In Washington, in think tanks,,where people are supposed to benthinking of new ideas,,you don't get bold new ideas,,because if you offer up a bold new idea,,not only are you attacked on Twitter,,but you will not get confirmednin a government job.,Because we are reactive to the heightenednvenom of the political debate,,you get governments that havenan us-versus-them mentality,,tiny groups of people making decisions.,When you sit in a room with a small groupnof people making decisions,,what do you get?,You get groupthink.,Everybody has the same worldview,,and any view from outside of the groupnis seen as a threat.,That's a danger.,You also have processesnthat become reactive to news cycles.,And so the parts of the U.S. governmentnthat do foresight, that look forward,,that do strategy --,the parts in other governmentsnthat do this -- can't do it,,because they're reactingnto the news cycle.,And so we're not looking ahead. 
 On 9/11, we had a crisisnbecause we were looking the wrong way.,Today we have a crisis because,nbecause of 9/11,,we are still lookingnin the wrong direction,,and we know because we seentransformational trends on the horizon,that are far more importantnthan what we saw on 9/11;,far more important than the threatnposed by these terrorists;,far more important evennthan the instability that we've got,in some areas of the worldnthat are racked by instability today.,In fact, the things that we are seeingnin those parts of the world,may be symptoms.,They may be a reaction to bigger trends.,And if we are treating the symptomnand ignoring the bigger trend,,then we've got far biggernproblems to deal with. 
 And so what are those trends?,Well, to a group like you,,the trends are apparent.,We are living at a momentnin which the very fabric of human society,is being rewoven.,If you saw the cover of The Economistna couple of days ago --,it said that 80 percentnof the people on the planet,,by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.,They would have a small computernconnected to the Internet in their pocket.,In most of Africa, the cell phonenpenetration rate is 80 percent.,We passed the point last October,when there were morenmobile cellular devices, SIM cards,,out in the world than there were people.,We are within yearsnof a profound moment in our history,,when effectively every singlenhuman being on the planet,is going to be part of a man-madensystem for the first time,,able to touch anyone else --,touch them for good, touch them for ill.,And the changes associated with thatnare changing the very nature,of every aspect of governancenand life on the planet,in ways that our leadersnought to be thinking about,,when they're thinking aboutnthese immediate threats. 
 On the security side,,we've come out of a Cold War in whichnit was too costly to fight a nuclear war,,and so we didn't,,to a period that I callnCool War, cyber war,,where the costs of conflict are actuallynso low, that we may never stop.,We may enter a period of constant warfare,,and we know this becausenwe've been in it for several years.,And yet, we don't have the basic doctrinesnto guide us in this regard.,We don't have the basic ideas formulated.,If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,,do have the ability to respondnwith a kinetic attack?,We don't know.,If somebody launches a cyber attack,nhow do we deter them?,When China launchedna series of cyber attacks,,what did the U.S. government do?,It said, we're going to indictna few of these Chinese guys,,who are never coming to America.,They're never going to be anywhere nearna law enforcement officer,who's going to take them into custody.,It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent. 
 Special forces operatorsnout there in the field today,discover that small groupsnof insurgents with cell phones,have access to satellite imagerynthat once only superpowers had.,In fact, if you've got a cell phone,,you've got access to powernthat a superpower didn't have,,and would have highlynclassified 10 years ago.,In my cell phone,nI have an app that tells me,where every plane in the world is,nand its altitude, and its speed,,and what kind of aircraft it is,,and where it's goingnand where it's landing.,They have apps that allow them to know,what their adversary is about to do.,They're using these tools in new ways.,When a cafe in Sydneynwas taken over by a terrorist,,he went in with a rifle...,and an iPad.,And the weapon was the iPad.,Because he captured people,nhe terrorized them,,he pointed the iPad at them,,and then he took the videonand he put it on the Internet,,and he took over the world's media. 
 But it doesn't just affectnthe security side.,The relations between great powers --,we thought we were past the bipolar era.,We thought we were in a unipolar world,,where all the big issues were resolved.,Remember? It was the end of history.,But we're not.,We're now seeing that ournbasic assumptions about the Internet --,that it was going to connect us,nweave society together --,are not necessarily true.,In countries like China,nyou have the Great Firewall of China.,You've got countries saying no,nif the Internet happens within our borders,we control it within our borders.,We control the content.nWe are going to control our security.,We are going to manage that Internet.,We are going to say what can be on it.,We're going to setna different set of rules.,Now you might think,nwell, that's just China.,But it's not just China.,It's China, India, Russia.,It's Saudi Arabia,nit's Singapore, it's Brazil.,After the NSA scandal, the Russians,nthe Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,,they said, let's createna new Internet backbone,,because we can't be dependentnon this other one.,And so all of a sudden, what do you have?,You have a new bipolar world,in which cyber-internationalism,,our belief,,is challenged by cyber-nationalism,,another belief. 
 We are seeing these changesneverywhere we look.,We are seeing the advent of mobile money.,It's happening in the placesnyou wouldn't expect.,It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,,where millions of people who haven'tnhad access to financial services,now conduct all thosenservices on their phones.,There are 2.5 million peoplenwho don't have financial service access,that are going to get it soon.,A billion of them are goingnto have the ability to access it,on their cell phone soon.,It's not just going to give themnthe ability to bank.,It's going to changenwhat monetary policy is.,It's going to change what money is.,Education is changing in the same way.,Healthcare is changing in the same way.,How government services are deliverednis changing in the same way. 
 And yet, in Washington, we are debating,whether to call the terrorist groupnthat has taken over Syria and Iraq,ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.,We are trying to determine,how much we want to givenin a negotiation with the Iranians,on a nuclear deal which dealsnwith the technologies of 50 years ago,,when in fact, we know that the Iraniansnright now are engaged in cyber war with us,and we're ignoring it, partiallynbecause businesses are not willing,to talk about the attacksnthat are being waged on them. 
 And that gets us to another breakdown,that's crucial,,and another breakdown that couldn't benmore important to a group like this,,because the growth of Americanand real American national security,and all of the things that drove progressneven during the Cold War,,was a public-private partnershipnbetween science, technology and government,that began when Thomas Jeffersonnsat alone in his laboratory,inventing new things.,But it was the canalsnand railroads and telegraph;,it was radar and the Internet.,It was Tang, the breakfast drink --,probably not the most importantnof those developments.,But what you had wasna partnership and a dialogue,,and the dialogue has broken down.,It's broken down because in Washington,,less government is considered more.,It's broken down because there is,nbelieve it or not,,in Washington, a war on science --,despite the fact thatnin all of human history,,every time anyone has wagedna war on science,,science has won. 
 (Applause) 
 But we have a governmentnthat doesn't want to listen,,that doesn't have peoplenat the highest levels,that understand this.,In the nuclear age,,when there were peoplenin senior national security jobs,,they were expected to speak throw-weight.,They were expected to knownthe lingo, the vocabulary.,If you went to the highest levelnof the U.S. government now,and said, "Talk to me about cyber,nabout neuroscience,,about the things that are goingnto change the world of tomorrow,",you'd get a blank stare.,I know, because when I wrote this book,,I talked to 150 people,nmany from the science and tech side,,who felt like they were beingnshunted off to the kids' table.,Meanwhile, on the tech side,,we have lots of wonderful peoplencreating wonderful things,,but they started in garagesnand they didn't need the government,and they don't want the government.,Many of them have a political viewnthat's somewhere between,libertarian and anarchic:,leave me alone. 
 But the world's coming apart.,All of a sudden, there are going to benmassive regulatory changes,and massive issuesnassociated with conflict,and massive issues associatednwith security and privacy.,And we haven't even gottennto the next set of issues,,which are philosophical issues.,If you can't vote,nif you can't have a job,,if you can't bank,nif you can't get health care,,if you can't be educatednwithout Internet access,,is Internet access a fundamental rightnthat should be written into constitutions?,If Internet access is a fundamental right,,is electricity access for the 1.2 billionnwho don't have access to electricity,a fundamental right?,These are fundamental issues.nWhere are the philosophers?,Where's the dialogue? 
 And that brings mento the reason that I'm here.,I live in Washington. Pity me. 
 (Laughter) 
 The dialogue isn't happening there.,These big issuesnthat will change the world,,change national security,nchange economics,,create hope, create threats,,can only be resolvednwhen you bring together,groups of people who understandnscience and technology,back together with government.,Both sides need each other.,And until we recreate that connection,,until we do what helped America grownand helped other countries grow,,then we are going to grownever more vulnerable.,The risks associated with 9/11nwill not be measured,in terms of lives lost by terror attacks,or buildings destroyednor trillions of dollars spent.,They'll be measured in terms of the costsnof our distraction from critical issues,and our inability to get together,scientists, technologists,ngovernment leaders,,at a moment of transformationnakin to the beginning of the Renaissance,,akin to the beginningnof the major transformational eras,that have happened on Earth,,and start coming up with,nif not the right answers,,then at least the right questions. 
 We are not there yet,,but discussions like thisnand groups like you,are the places where those questionsncan be formulated and posed.,And that's why I believenthat groups like TED,,discussions like this around the planet,,are the place where the futurenof foreign policy, of economic policy,,of social policy, of philosophy,nwill ultimately take place.,And that's why it's beenna pleasure speaking to you. 
 Thank you very, very much. 
 (Applause)In 2012, when I paintednthe minaret of Jara Mosque,in my hometown of Gabés,nin the south of Tunisia,,I never thought that graffiti would bringnso much attention to a city. 
 At the beginning, I was just lookingnfor a wall in my hometown,,and it happened that the minaretnwas built in '94.,And for 18 years, those 57 metersnof concrete stayed grey.,When I met the imam for the first time,nand I told him what I wanted to do,,he was like, "Thank God you finally came,",and he told me that for yearsnhe was waiting for somebody,to do something on it.,The most amazing thing about this imamnis that he didn't ask me anything --,neither a sketch,nor what I was going to write. 
 In every work that I create,nI write messages,with my style of calligraffiti --na mix of calligraphy and graffiti.,I use quotes or poetry.,For the minaret, I thought thatnthe most relevant message,to be put on a mosquenshould come from the Quran,,so I picked this verse:,"Oh humankind, we have created younfrom a male and a female,,and made you people and tribe,nso you may know each other.",It was a universal call for peace,ntolerance, and acceptance,coming from the side that we don't usuallynportray in a good way in the media. 
 I was amazed to see how the localncommunity reacted to the painting,,and how it made them proud to seenthe minaret getting so much attention,from international pressnall around the world.,For the imam, it was notnjust the painting;,it was really deeper than that.,He hoped that this minaret would becomena monument for the city,,and attract peoplento this forgotten place of Tunisia.,The universality of the message,,the political contextnof Tunisia at this time,,and the fact that I was writingnQuran in a graffiti way,were not insignificant.,It reunited the community. 
 Bringing people, future generations,,together through Arabic calligraphy,is what I do.,Writing messages isnthe essence of my artwork.,What is funny, actually, is thatneven Arabic-speaking people,really need to focus a lotnto decipher what I'm writing.,You don't need to knownthe meaning to feel the piece.,I think that Arabic script touchesnyour soul before it reaches your eyes.,There is a beauty in itnthat you don't need to translate.,Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;,to you, to you, to you, to anybody,,and then when you get the meaning,,you feel connected to it.,I always make sure to write messages,that are relevant to the placenwhere I'm painting,,but messages that havena universal dimension,,so anybody around the worldncan connect to it. 
 I was born and raised in France, in Paris,,and I started learning how to writenand read Arabic when I was 18.,Today I only write messages in Arabic.,One of the reasonsnthis is so important to me,,is because of all the reaction thatnI've experienced all around the world. 
 In Rio de Janeiro, I translatednthis Portuguese poem,from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,,who was giving an homagento the poor people of the favela,,and then I painted it on the rooftop.,The local community were reallynintrigued by what I was doing,,but as soon as I gave themnthe meaning of the calligraphy,,they thanked me, as they feltnconnected to the piece. 
 In South Africa, in Cape Town,,the local community of Philippi,offered me the onlynconcrete wall of the slum.,It was a school, and I wrote on it,a quote from Nelson Mandela,,saying, "[in Arabic],",which means, "It seemsnimpossible until it's done.",Then this guy came to me and said,n"Man, why you don't write in English?",and I replied to him, "I would considernyour concern legit if you asked me,why I didn't write in Zulu." 
 In Paris, once, there was this event,,and someone gave his wall to be painted.,And when he saw I was painting in Arabic,,he got so mad -- actually, hysterical --nand he asked for the wall to be erased.,I was mad and disappointed.,But a week later, the organizernof the event asked me to come back,,and he told me that there was a wallnright in front of this guy's house.,So, this guy --,(Laughter),like, was forced to see it every day.,At the beginning, I was goingnto write, "[In Arabic],",which means, "In your face," but --,(Laughter),I decided to be smarternand I wrote, "[In Arabic],",which means, "Open your heart." 
 I'm really proud of my culture,,and I'm trying to be an ambassadornof it through my artwork.,And I hope that I can breaknthe stereotypes we all know,,with the beauty of Arabic script.,Today, I don't write the translationnof the message anymore on the wall.,I don't want the poetrynof the calligraphy to be broken,,as it's art and you can appreciate itnwithout knowing the meaning,,as you can enjoy any musicnfrom other countries.,Some people see thatnas a rejection or a closed door,,but for me, it's more an invitation --,to my language,nto my culture, and to my art. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm thrilled to be here tonight,to share with you somethingnwe've been working on,for over two years,,and it's in the areanof additive manufacturing,,also known as 3D printing. 
 You see this object here.,It looks fairly simple,nbut it's quite complex at the same time.,It's a set of concentricngeodesic structures,with linkages between each one.,In its context, it is not manufacturablenby traditional manufacturing techniques.,It has a symmetry suchnthat you can't injection mold it.,You can't even manufacture itnthrough milling.,This is a job for a 3D printer,,but most 3D printers would take betweennthree and 10 hours to fabricate it,,and we're going to take the risk tonightnto try to fabricate it onstage,during this 10-minute talk.,Wish us luck. 
 Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.,It's actually 2D printingnover and over again,,and it in fact uses the technologiesnassociated with 2D printing.,Think about inkjet printing where younlay down ink on a page to make letters,,and then do that over and over againnto build up a three-dimensional object.,In microelectronics, they use something,called lithography to donthe same sort of thing,,to make the transistorsnand integrated circuits,and build up a structure several times.,These are all 2D printing technologies. 
 Now, I'm a chemist,na material scientist too,,and my co-inventorsnare also material scientists,,one a chemist, one a physicist,,and we began to beninterested in 3D printing.,And very often, as you know,nnew ideas are often simple connections,between people with different experiencesnin different communities,,and that's our story. 
 Now, we were inspired,by the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,,and we thought, why couldn't a 3D printernoperate in this fashion,,where you have an objectnarise out of a puddle,in essentially real time,with essentially no waste,to make a great object?,Okay, just like the movies.,And could we be inspired by Hollywood,and come up with waysnto actually try to get this to work?,And that was our challenge.,And our approach would be,nif we could do this,,then we could fundamentally addressnthe three issues holding back 3D printing,from being a manufacturing process. 
 One, 3D printing takes forever.,There are mushrooms that grow fasternthan 3D printed parts. (Laughter),The layer by layer process,leads to defectsnin mechanical properties,,and if we could grow continuously,nwe could eliminate those defects.,And in fact, if we could grow really fast,nwe could also start using materials,that are self-curing,nand we could have amazing properties.,So if we could pull this off,nimitate Hollywood,,we could in fact address 3D manufacturing. 
 Our approach is to usensome standard knowledge,in polymer chemistry,to harness light and oxygennto grow parts continuously.,Light and oxygen work in different ways.,Light can take a resinnand convert it to a solid,,can convert a liquid to a solid.,Oxygen inhibits that process.,So light and oxygennare polar opposites from one another,from a chemical point of view,,and if we can control spatiallynthe light and oxygen,,we could control this process.,And we refer to this as CLIP.n[Continuous Liquid Interface Production.],It has three functional components.,One, it has a reservoirnthat holds the puddle,,just like the T-1000.,At the bottom of the reservoirnis a special window.,I'll come back to that.,In addition, it has a stagenthat will lower into the puddle,and pull the object out of the liquid.,The third componentnis a digital light projection system,underneath the reservoir,,illuminating with lightnin the ultraviolet region. 
 Now, the key is that this windownin the bottom of this reservoir,,it's a composite,nit's a very special window.,It's not only transparent to lightnbut it's permeable to oxygen.,It's got characteristicsnlike a contact lens.,So we can see how the process works.,You can start to see thatnas you lower a stage in there,,in a traditional process,nwith an oxygen-impermeable window,,you make a two-dimensional pattern,and you end up gluing that onto the windownwith a traditional window,,and so in order to introducenthe next layer, you have to separate it,,introduce new resin, reposition it,,and do this process over and over again.,But with our very special window,,what we're able to do is,nwith oxygen coming through the bottom,as light hits it,,that oxygen inhibits the reaction,,and we form a dead zone.,This dead zone is on the ordernof tens of microns thick,,so that's two or three diametersnof a red blood cell,,right at the window interfacenthat remains a liquid,,and we pull this object up,,and as we talked about in a Science paper,,as we change the oxygen content,nwe can change the dead zone thickness.,And so we have a number of key variablesnthat we control: oxygen content,,the light, the light intensity,nthe dose to cure,,the viscosity, the geometry,,and we use very sophisticated softwarento control this process. 
 The result is pretty staggering.,It's 25 to 100 times fasternthan traditional 3D printers,,which is game-changing.,In addition, as our abilitynto deliver liquid to that interface,,we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,,and that in fact opens up the opportunitynfor generating a lot of heat,,and as a chemical engineer,nI get very excited at heat transfer,and the idea that we might one daynhave water-cooled 3D printers,,because they're going so fast.,In addition, because we're growing things,nwe eliminate the layers,,and the parts are monolithic.,You don't see the surface structure.,You have molecularly smooth surfaces.,And the mechanical propertiesnof most parts made in a 3D printer,are notorious for having propertiesnthat depend on the orientation,with which how you printed it,nbecause of the layer-like structure.,But when you grow objects like this,,the properties are invariantnwith the print direction.,These look like injection-molded parts,,which is very differentnthan traditional 3D manufacturing.,In addition, we're able to throw,the entire polymernchemistry textbook at this,,and we're able to design chemistriesnthat can give rise to the properties,you really want in a 3D-printed object. 
 (Applause) 
 There it is. That's great.,You always take the risk that somethingnlike this won't work onstage, right? 
 But we can have materialsnwith great mechanical properties.,For the first time, we can have elastomers,that are high elasticitynor high dampening.,Think about vibration controlnor great sneakers, for example.,We can make materialsnthat have incredible strength,,high strength-to-weight ratio,nreally strong materials,,really great elastomers,,so throw that in the audience there.,So great material properties. 
 And so the opportunity now,nif you actually make a part,that has the propertiesnto be a final part,,and you do it in game-changing speeds,,you can actually transform manufacturing.,Right now, in manufacturing,nwhat happens is,,the so-called digital threadnin digital manufacturing.,We go from a CAD drawing, a design,nto a prototype to manufacturing.,Often, the digital thread is brokennright at prototype,,because you can't gonall the way to manufacturing,because most parts don't haventhe properties to be a final part.,We now can connect the digital thread,all the way from designnto prototyping to manufacturing,,and that opportunitynreally opens up all sorts of things,,from better fuel-efficient carsndealing with great lattice properties,with high strength-to-weight ratio,,new turbine blades,nall sorts of wonderful things. 
 Think about if you need a stentnin an emergency situation,,instead of the doctor pulling offna stent out of the shelf,that was just standard sizes,,having a stent that's designednfor you, for your own anatomy,with your own tributaries,,printed in an emergency situationnin real time out of the properties,such that the stent could go awaynafter 18 months: really-game changing.,Or digital dentistry, and makingnthese kinds of structures,even while you're in the dentist chair.,And look at the structuresnthat my students are making,at the University of North Carolina.,These are amazing microscale structures. 
 You know, the world is really goodnat nano-fabrication.,Moore's Law has driven thingsnfrom 10 microns and below.,We're really good at that,,but it's actually very hard to make thingsnfrom 10 microns to 1,000 microns,,the mesoscale.,And subtractive techniquesnfrom the silicon industry,can't do that very well.,They can't etch wafers that well.,But this process is so gentle,,we can grow these objectsnup from the bottom,using additive manufacturing,and make amazing thingsnin tens of seconds,,opening up new sensor technologies,,new drug delivery techniques,,new lab-on-a-chip applications,nreally game-changing stuff. 
 So the opportunity of makingna part in real time,that has the properties to be a final part,really opens up 3D manufacturing,,and for us, this is very exciting,nbecause this really is owning,the intersection between hardware,nsoftware and molecular science,,and I can't wait to see what designersnand engineers around the world,are going to be able to donwith this great tool. 
 Thanks for listening. 
 (Applause)G'day, my name's Kevin.,I'm from Australia. I'm here to help.,(Laughter) 
 Tonight, I want to talk aboutna tale of two cities.,One of those cities is called Washington,nand the other is called Beijing.,Because how these two capitalsnshape their future,and the future of the United Statesnand the future of China,doesn't just affect those two countries,,it affects all of us,in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:,the air we breathe, the water we drink,,the fish we eat,nthe quality of our oceans,,the languages we speak in the future,,the jobs we have,nthe political systems we choose,,and, of course, the great questionsnof war and peace. 
 You see that bloke? He's French.,His name is Napoleon.,A couple of hundred years ago,,he made this extraordinary projection:,"China is a sleeping lion,nand when she awakes,,the world will shake.",Napoleon got a few things wrong;,he got this one absolutely right.,Because China is todaynnot just woken up,,China has stood upnand China is on the march,,and the question for us all,is where will China go,and how do we engagenthis giant of the 21st century? 
 You start looking at the numbers,nthey start to confront you in a big way.,It's projected that China will become,,by whichever measure --nPPP, market exchange rates --,the largest economy in the world,over the course of the decade ahead.,They're alreadynthe largest trading nation,,already the largest exporting nation,,already the largest manufacturing nation,,and they're also the biggestnemitters of carbon in the world.,America comes second. 
 So if China does becomenthe world's largest economy,,think about this:,It'll be the first time,since this guy was onnthe throne of England --,George III, not a good friendnof Napoleon's --,that in the world we will havenas the largest economy,a non-English speaking country,,a non-Western country,,a non-liberal democratic country.,And if you don't thinknthat's going to affect,the way in which the worldnhappens in the future,,then personally, I thinknyou've been smoking something,,and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. 
 So in short, the questionnwe have tonight is,,how do we understand this mega-change,,which I believe to be the biggest changenfor the first half of the 21st century?,It'll affect so many things.,It will go to the absolute core.,It's happening quietly.nIt's happening persistently.,It's happening in some sensesnunder the radar,,as we are all preoccupied with,what's going in Ukraine,nwhat's going on in the Middle East,,what's going on with ISIS,nwhat's going on with ISIL,,what's happening withnthe future of our economies.,This is a slow and quiet revolution.,And with a mega-changencomes also a mega-challenge,,and the mega-challenge is this:,Can these two great countries,,China and the United States --,China,,the Middle Kingdom,,and the United States,,Měiguó --,which in Chinese, by the way,nmeans "the beautiful country.",Think about that -- that's the namenthat China has given this country,for more than a hundred years.,Whether these two great civilizations,nthese two great countries,,can in fact carve out a common future,for themselves and for the world?,In short, can we carve out a future,which is peaceful and mutually prosperous,,or are we looking at a great challenge,of war or peace?,And I have 15 minutesnto work through war or peace,,which is a little less time,than they gave this guy to write a bookncalled "War and Peace." 
 People ask me, why is it that a kidngrowing up in rural Australia,got interested in learning Chinese?,Well, there are two reasons for that.,Here's the first of them.,That's Betsy the cow.,Now, Betsy the cow was onenof a herd of dairy cattle,that I grew up with on a farmnin rural Australia.,See those hands there?nThese are not built for farming.,So very early on, I discoverednthat in fact, working in a farm,was not designed for me,nand China was a very safe remove,from any career in Australian farm life. 
 Here's the second reason.,That's my mom.,Anyone here ever listennto what their mom told them to do?,Everyone ever do whatntheir mom told them to do?,I rarely did,,but what my mom said to me was,,one day, she handed me a newspaper,,a headline which said,nhere we have a huge change.,And that change is Chinanentering the United Nations.,1971, I had just turned 14 years of age,,and she handed me this headline.,And she said, "Understand this, nlearn this,,because it's going to affect your future." 
 So being a very good student of history,,I decided that the best thingnfor me to do was, in fact,,to go off and learn Chinese.,The great thing about learning Chinese,is that your Chinese teacherngives you a new name.,And so they gave me this name:,Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer,,and Wén, and that's the characternfor literature or the arts.,Kè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.,Any of you guys called "Kevin"?,It's a major lift from being called Kevinnto be called Conqueror of the Classics.,(Laughter),I've been called Kevin all my life.,Have you been called Kevin all your life?,Would you prefer to be callednConqueror of the Classics? 
 And so I went off after thatnand joined the Australian Foreign Service,,but here is where pride -- before pride,nthere always comes a fall.,So there I am in the embassy in Beijing,,off to the Great Hall of the People,with our ambassador, who had asked mento interpret for his first meeting,in the Great Hall of the People.,And so there was I.,If you've been to a Chinese meeting,nit's a giant horseshoe.,At the head of the horsehoenare the really serious pooh-bahs,,and down the end of the horseshoenare the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,,the junior woodchucks like me.,And so the ambassadornbegan with this inelegant phrase.,He said, "China and Australianare currently enjoying a relationship,of unprecedented closeness.",And I thought to myself,,"That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd.,I will improve it.",Note to file: Never do that.,It needed to be a little more elegant,na little more classical,,so I rendered it as follows.,[In Chinese] 
 There was a big pausenon the other side of the room.,You could see the giant pooh-bahsnat the head of the horseshoe,,the blood visibly drainingnfrom their faces,,and the junior woodchucksnat the other end of the horseshoe,engaged in peals of nunrestrained laughter.,Because when I rendered his sentence,,"Australia and China are nenjoying a relationship,of unprecedented closeness,",in fact, what I said was thatnAustralia and China,were now experiencing fantastic orgasm.,(Laughter) 
 That was the last timenI was asked to interpret.,But in that little story,nthere's a wisdom, which is,,as soon as you think you know somethingnabout this extraordinary civilization,of 5,000 years of continuing history,,there's always something new to learn. 
 History is against us,when it comes to the U.S. and China,forging a common future together.,This guy up here?,He's not Chinese and he's not American.,He's Greek. His name's Thucydides.,He wrote the historynof the Peloponnesian Wars.,And he made this extraordinary observation,about Athens and Sparta.,"It was the rise of Athensnand the fear that this inspired in Sparta,that made war inevitable.",And hence, a whole literature aboutnsomething called the Thucydides Trap. 
 This guy here? He's not Americannand he's not Greek. He's Chinese.,His name is Sun Tzu.nHe wrote "The Art of War,",and if you see his statement underneath,nit's along these lines:,"Attack him where he is unprepared,nappear where you are not expected.",Not looking good so farnfor China and the United States. 
 This guy is an American.nHis name's Graham Allison.,In fact, he's a teachernat the Kennedy School,over there in Boston.,He's working on a single projectnat the moment, which is,,does the Thucydides Trapnabout the inevitably of war,between rising powersnand established great powers,apply to the futurenof China-U.S. relations?,It's a core question.,And what Graham has donenis explore 15 cases in history,since the 1500s,to establish what the precedents are.,And in 11 out of 15 of them,,let me tell you,,they've ended in catastrophic war. 
 You may say, "But Kevin --,or Conqueror of the Classics --,that was the past.,We live now in a worldnof interdependence and globalization.,It could never happen again.",Guess what?,The economic historiansntell us that in fact,,the time which we reachednthe greatest point,of economic integration and globalization,was in 1914,,just before that happened, World War I,,a sobering reflection from history. 
 So if we are engagednin this great question,of how China thinks, feels,,and positions itselfntowards the United States,,and the reverse,,how do we get to the baseline,of how these two countriesnand civilizations,can possibly work together? 
 Let me first go to, in fact,,China's views of the U.S.nand the rest of the West.,Number one: China feelsnas if it's been humiliated,at the hands of the Westnthrough a hundred years of history,,beginning with the Opium Wars.,When after that, the Western powersncarved China up into little pieces,,so that by the timenit got to the '20s and '30s,,signs like this one appearednon the streets of Shanghai.,["No dogs and Chinese allowed"],How would you feel if you were Chinese,,in your own country, nif you saw that sign appear?,China also believes and feels,as if, in the events of 1919,nat the Peace Conference in Paris,,when Germany's colonies were given back,to all sorts of countriesnaround in the world,,what about German colonies in China?,They were, in fact, given to Japan.,When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s,the world looked away and was indifferentnto what would happen to China.,And then, on top of that,nthe Chinese to this day believe,that the United States and the West,do not accept the legitimacynof their political system,because it's so radically differentnfrom those of us who come,from liberal democracies,,and believe that the United Statesnto this day is seeking,to undermine their political system.,China also believesnthat it is being contained,by U.S. allies and by thosenwith strategic partnerships with the U.S.,right around its periphery.,And beyond all that,nthe Chinese have this feeling,in their heart of heartsnand in their gut of guts,that those of us in the collective West,are just too damned arrogant.,That is, we don't recognizenthe problems in our own system,,in our politics and our economics,,and are very quicknto point the finger elsewhere,,and believe that, in fact,nwe in the collective West,are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. 
 Of course, in international relations,,it's not just the soundnof one hand clapping.,There's another country too,nand that's called the U.S.,So how does the U.S.nrespond to all of the above?,The U.S. has a response to each of those.,On the question ofnis the U.S. containing China,,they say, "No, look at the history ofnthe Soviet Union. That was containment.",Instead, what we have donenin the U.S. and the West,is welcome Chinaninto the global economy,,and on top of that, welcome themninto the World Trade Organization.,The U.S. and the West say China cheats,on the questionnof intellectual property rights,,and through cyberattacksnon U.S. and global firms.,Furthermore, the United Statesnsays that the Chinese political system,is fundamentally wrong,because it's at such fundamental variance,to the human rights, democracy,nand rule of law that we enjoy,in the U.S. and the collective West.,And on top of all the above,nwhat does the United States say?,That they fear that China will,nwhen it has sufficient power,,establish a sphere of influencenin Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,,boot the United States out,,and in time, when it's powerful enough,,unilaterally seek to changenthe rules of the global order. 
 So apart from all of that,nit's just fine and dandy,,the U.S.-China relationship.,No real problems there.,The challenge, though,nis given those deep-rooted feelings,,those deep-rooted emotionsnand thought patterns,,what the Chinese call "Sīwéi,"nways of thinking,,how can we craft a basisnfor a common future between these two? 
 I argue simply this:,We can do it on the basis on a framework,of constructive realismnfor a common purpose.,What do I mean by that?,Be realistic about the thingsnthat we disagree on,,and a management approachnthat doesn't enable,any one of those differencesnto break into war or conflict,until we've acquirednthe diplomatic skills to solve them.,Be constructive in areas of thenbilateral, regional and global engagement,between the two,,which will make a differencenfor all of humankind.,Build a regional institutionncapable of cooperation in Asia,,an Asia-Pacific community.,And worldwide, act further,,like you've begun to donat the end of last year,by striking out against climate change,with hands joined togethernrather than fists apart. 
 Of course, all that happensnif you've got a common mechanism,and political will to achieve the above.,These things are deliverable.,But the question is,nare they deliverable alone?,This is what our headntells us we need to do,,but what about our heart? 
 I have a little experiencenin the question back home,of how you try to bringntogether two peoples,who, frankly, haven't hadna whole lot in common in the past.,And that's when I apologizednto Australia's indigenous peoples.,This was a day of reckoningnin the Australian government,,the Australian parliament,nand for the Australian people.,After 200 years of unbridled abusentowards the first Australians,,it was high time that we white folksnsaid we were sorry. 
 The important thing --,(Applause) 
 The important thing that I remembernis staring in the faces,of all those from Aboriginal Australia,as they came to listen to this apology.,It was extraordinary to see, for example,,old women telling me the storiesnof when they were five years old,and literally ripped awaynfrom their parents,,like this lady here.,It was extraordinary for mento then be able to embrace,and to kiss Aboriginal eldersnas they came into the parliament building,,and one woman said to me,,it's the first time a white fellanhad ever kissed her in her life,,and she was over 70.,That's a terrible story. 
 And then I remembernthis family saying to me,,"You know, we drove all the waynfrom the far North down to Canberra,to come to this thing,,drove our way through redneck country.,On the way back, stopped at a cafenafter the apology for a milkshake.",And they walked into this cafenquietly, tentatively, gingerly,,a little anxious.,I think you know what I'm talking about.,But the day after the apology,nwhat happened?,Everyone in that cafe,nevery one of the white folks,,stood up and applauded.,Something had happened in the heartsnof these people in Australia.,The white folks, our Aboriginalnbrothers and sisters,,and we haven't solvednall these problems together,,but let me tell you,nthere was a new beginning,because we had gone not just to the head,,we'd gone also to the heart. 
 So where does that concludenin terms of the great question,that we've been askednto address this evening,,which is the futurenof U.S.-China relations?,The head says there's a way forward.,The head says there is a policy framework,nthere's a common narrative,,there's a mechanismnthrough regular summitry,to do these thingsnand to make them better.,But the heart must also find a waynto reimagine the possibilities,of the America-China relationship,,and the possibilities of China'snfuture engagement in the world.,Sometimes, folks, we just neednto take a leap of faith,not quite knowing where we might land. 
 In China, they now talk aboutnthe Chinese Dream.,In America, we're all familiarnwith the term "the American Dream.",I think it's time, across the world,,that we're able to think alsonof something we might also call,a dream for all humankind.,Because if we do that,,we might just change the way,that we think about each other. 
 [In Chinese] 
 That's my challenge to America.nThat's my challenge to China.,That's my challenge to all of us,,but I think where there's a willnand where there is imagination,we can turn this into a future,driven by peace and prosperity,and not once again repeat,the tragedies of war. 
 I thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thanks so much for that.nThanks so much for that.,It feels like you yourselfnhave a role to play in this bridging.,You, in a way, are uniquely placednto speak to both sides. 
 Kevin Rudd: Well, what we Australiansndo best is organize the drinks,,so you get them together in one room,nand we suggest this and suggest that,,then we go and get the drinks.,But no, look, for all of usnwho are friends,of these two great countries,nAmerica and China,,you can do something.,You can make a practical contribution,,and for all you good folks here,,next time you meet someone from China,,sit down and have a conversation.,See what you can find out aboutnwhere they come from and what they think,,and my challenge for allnthe Chinese folks,who are going to watchnthis TED Talk at some time,is do the same.,Two of us seeking to change the worldncan actually make a huge difference.,Those of us up the middle,nwe can make a small contribution. 
 CA: Kevin, all power to you,nmy friend. Thank you. 
 KR: Thank you. Thank you, folks. 
 (Applause)We're at a tipping point in human history,,a species poised between gaining the starsnand losing the planet we call home. 
 Even in just the past few years,nwe've greatly expanded,our knowledge of how Earth fitsnwithin the context of our universe.,NASA's Kepler mission has discovered,thousands of potential planetsnaround other stars,,indicating that Earth is but onenof billions of planets in our galaxy.,Kepler is a space telescope,that measures the subtle dimming of starsnas planets pass in front of them,,blocking just a little bitnof that light from reaching us.,Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes,as well as their distancenfrom their parent star.,Together, this helps us understandnwhether these planets are small and rocky,,like the terrestrial planetsnin our own Solar System,,and also how much light they receivenfrom their parent sun.,In turn, this provides clues as to whethernthese planets that we discover,might be habitable or not. 
 Unfortunately, at the same timenas we're discovering this treasure trove,of potentially habitable worlds,,our own planet is saggingnunder the weight of humanity.,2014 was the hottest year on record.,Glaciers and sea ice that havenbeen with us for millennia,are now disappearingnin a matter of decades.,These planetary-scale environmental nchanges that we have set in motion,are rapidly outpacing our abilitynto alter their course. 
 But I'm not a climate scientist,nI'm an astronomer.,I study planetary habitabilitynas influenced by stars,with the hopes of findingnthe places in the universe,where we might discovernlife beyond our own planet.,You could say that I look fornchoice alien real estate. 
 Now, as somebody who is deeply embeddednin the search for life in the universe,,I can tell you that the morenyou look for planets like Earth,,the more you appreciatenour own planet itself.,Each one of these new worldsninvites a comparison,between the newly discovered planetnand the planets we know best:,those of our own Solar System. 
 Consider our neighbor, Mars.,Mars is small and rocky,nand though it's a bit far from the Sun,,it might be consideredna potentially habitable world,if found by a mission like Kepler.,Indeed, it's possible that Marsnwas habitable in the past,,and in part, this is whynwe study Mars so much.,Our rovers, like Curiosity,ncrawl across its surface,,scratching for clues as to the originsnof life as we know it.,Orbiters like the MAVEN missionnsample the Martian atmosphere,,trying to understand how Marsnmight have lost its past habitability.,Private spaceflight companies now offernnot just a short trip to near space,but the tantalizing possibilitynof living our lives on Mars. 
 But though these Martian vistas,resemble the desertsnof our own home world,,places that are tied in our imaginationnto ideas about pioneering and frontiers,,compared to Earth,Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.,Consider the extent to whichnwe have not colonized,the deserts of our own planet,,places that are lushnby comparison with Mars.,Even in the driest,nhighest places on Earth,,the air is sweet and thick with oxygen,exhaled from thousands of miles awaynby our rainforests. 
 I worry -- I worry that this excitementnabout colonizing Mars and other planets,carries with it a long, dark shadow:,the implication and belief by some,that Mars will be there to save usnfrom the self-inflicted destruction,of the only truly habitable planetnwe know of, the Earth.,As much as I loveninterplanetary exploration,,I deeply disagree with this idea.,There are many excellent reasonsnto go to Mars,,but for anyone to tell you that Marsnwill be there to back up humanity,is like the captain of the Titanicntelling you that the real party,is happening later on the lifeboats.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 But the goals of interplanetarynexploration and planetary preservation,are not opposed to one another.,No, they're in fact two sidesnof the same goal:,to understand, preservenand improve life into the future.,The extreme environmentsnof our own world are alien vistas.,They're just closer to home.,If we can understand how to createnand maintain habitable spaces,out of hostile, inhospitablenspaces here on Earth,,perhaps we can meet the needsnof both preserving our own environment,and moving beyond it. 
 I leave you with a finalnthought experiment:,Fermi's paradox.,Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Ferminasked that, given the fact,that our universe has been aroundnfor a very long time,and we expect that therenare many planets within it,,we should have found evidencenfor alien life by now.,So where are they?,Well, one possible solutionnto Fermi's paradox,is that, as civilizations becomentechnologically advanced enough,to consider living amongst the stars,,they lose sight of how important it is,to safeguard the home worlds that fosterednthat advancement to begin with.,It is hubris to believenthat interplanetary colonization alone,will save us from ourselves,,but planetary preservationnand interplanetary exploration,can work together. 
 If we truly believe in our ability,to bend the hostile environments of Marsnfor human habitation,,then we should be able to surmountnthe far easier task of preserving,the habitability of the Earth. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Now...,let's go back in time.,It's 1974.,There is the gallery somewhere,in the world,,and there is a young girl, age 23,,standing in the middle of the space.,In the front of her is a table.,On the table there are 76 objects,for pleasure and for pain.,Some of the objects are,a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.,But also the knife,nthe razor blade, the hammer,and the pistol with one bullet.,There are instructions which say,,"I'm an object.,You can use everything on the table on me.,I'm taking all responsibility --neven killing me.,And the time is six hours." 
 The beginning of thisnperformance was easy.,People would give menthe glass of water to drink,,they'd give me the rose.,But very soon after,,there was a man who took the scissorsnand cut my clothes,,and then they took the thorns of the rosenand stuck them in my stomach.,Somebody took the razor bladenand cut my neck and drank the blood,,and I still have the scar.,The women would tell the men what to do.,And the men didn't rape menbecause it was just a normal opening,,and it was all public,,and they were with their wives.,They carried me aroundnand put me on the table,,and put the knife between my legs.,And somebody took the pistol and bulletnand put it against my temple.,And another person took the pistolnand they started a fight. 
 And after six hours were finished,,I...,started walking towards the public.,I was a mess.,I was half-naked, I was full of bloodnand tears were running down my face.,And everybody escaped, they just ran away.,They could not confront myself,nwith myself as a normal human being.,And then --,what happened,is I went to the hotel,nit was at two in the morning.,And,I looked at myself in the mirror,,and I had a piece of gray hair.,Alright --,please take off your blindfolds. 
 Welcome to the performance world.,First of all, let's explainnwhat the performance is.,So many artists,nso many different explanations,,but my explanationnfor performance is very simple.,Performance is a mentalnand physical construction,that the performer makesnin a specific time,in a space in front of an audience,and then energy dialogue happens.,The audience and the performernmake the piece together.,And the difference betweennperformance and theater is huge.,In the theater, the knife is not a knife,and the blood is just ketchup.,In the performance,nthe blood is the material,,and the razor blade or knife is the tool.,It's all about being therenin the real time,,and you can't rehearse performance,,because you can't do manynof these types of things twice -- ever.,Which is very important,nthe performance is --,you know, all human beingsnare always afraid of very simple things.,We're afraid of suffering,nwe're afraid of pain,,we're afraid of mortality.,So what I'm doing --,I'm staging these kinds of fearsnin front of the audience.,I'm using your energy,,and with this energy I can gonand push my body as far as I can.,And then I liberate myselfnfrom these fears.,And I'm your mirror.,If I can do this for myself,nyou can do it for you. 
 After Belgrade, where I was born,,I went to Amsterdam.,And you know, I've been doing performances,since the last 40 years.,And here I met Ulay,,and he was the personnI actually fell in love with.,And we made, for 12 years,nperformances together.,You know the knifenand the pistols and the bullets,,I exchange into love and trust.,So to do this kind worknyou have to trust the person completely,because this arrownis pointing to my heart.,So, heart beating and adrenalinenis rushing and so on,,is about trust, is about total trustnto another human being. 
 Our relationship was 12 years,,and we worked on so many subjects,nboth male and female energy.,And as every relationshipncomes to an end, ours went too.,We didn't make phone callsnlike normal human beings do,and say, you know, "This is over.",We walked the Great Wallnof China to say goodbye.,I started at the Yellow Sea,nand he started from the Gobi Desert.,We walked, each of us, three months,,two and a half thousand kilometers.,It was the mountains, it was difficult.,It was climbing, it was ruins.,It was, you know, going throughnthe 12 Chinese provinces,,this was before China was open in '87.,And we succeeded to meet in the middle,to say goodbye.,And then our relationship stopped. 
 And now, it completely changednhow I see the public.,And one very important piecenI made in those days,was "Balkan Baroque.",And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,,and I wanted to creatensome very strong, charismatic image,,something that could servenfor any war at any time,,because the Balkan Wars are now finished,nbut there's always some war, somewhere.,So here I am washing,two and a half thousandndead, big, bloody cow bones.,You can't wash the blood,nyou never can wash shame off the wars.,So I'm washing this six hours, six days,nand wars are coming off these bones,,and becoming possible --nan unbearable smell.,But then something stays in the memory. 
 I want to show you the onenwho really changed my life,,and this was the performance in MoMa,nwhich I just recently made.,This performance --nwhen I said to the curator,,"I'm just going to sit at the chair,,and there will benan empty chair at the front,,and anybody from the publicncan come and sit as long as they want.",The curator said to me,,"That's ridiculous, you know,nthis is New York,,this chair will be empty,,nobody has time to sit in front of you." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I sit for three months.,And I sit everyday, eight hours --,the opening of the museum --,and 10 hours on Fridaynwhen the museum is open 10 hours,,and I never move.,And I removed the tablenand I'm still sitting,,and this changed everything.,This performance,nmaybe 10 or 15 years ago --,nothing would have happened.,But the need of people to actuallynexperience something different,,the public was not anymore the group --,relation was one to one.,I was watching these people,nthey would come and sit in front of me,,but they would have to waitnfor hours and hours and hours,to get to this position,,and finally, they sit. 
 And what happened?,They are observed by the other people,,they're photographed,nthey're filmed by the camera,,they're observed by me,and they have nowhere to escapenexcept in themselves.,And that makes a difference.,There was so much pain and loneliness,,there's so much incredible thingsnwhen you look in somebody else's eyes,,because in the gazenwith that total stranger,,that you never even say one word --neverything happened.,And I understood when I stood upnfrom that chair after three months,,I am not the same anymore.,And I understoodnthat I have a very strong mission,,that I have to communicate this experience,to everybody. 
 And this is how, for me, was born the idea,to have an institutenof immaterial performing arts.,Because thinking about immateriality,,performance is time-based art.,It's not like a painting.,You have the painting on the wall,nthe next day it's there.,Performance, if you are missing it,nyou only have the memory,,or the story of somebody else telling you,,but you actually missed the whole thing.,So you have to be there.,And in my point,nif you talk about immaterial art,,music is the highest --nabsolutely highest art of all,,because it's the most immaterial.,And then after this is performance,nand then everything else.,That's my subjective way. 
 This institute is going to happennin Hudson, upstate New York,,and we are trying to buildnwith Rem Koolhaas, an idea.,And it's very simple.,If you want to get experience,nyou have to give me your time.,You have to sign the contractnbefore you enter the building,,that you will spend therena full six hours,,you have to give me your word of honor.,It's something so old-fashioned,,but if you don't respect your ownnword of honor and you leave before --,that's not my problem.,But it's six hours, the experience.,And then after you finish,nyou get a certificate of accomplishment,,so get home and frame it if you want. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is orientation hall.,The public comes in, and the first thingnyou have to do is dress in lab coats.,It's this importance,of stepping from beingnjust a viewer into experimenter.,And then you go to the lockers,and you put your watch,nyour iPhone, your iPod, your computer,and everything digital, electronic.,And you are getting free timenfor yourself for the first time.,Because there is nothingnwrong with technology,,our approach to technology is wrong.,We are losing the timenwe have for ourselves.,This is an institutento actually give you back this time. 
 So what you do here,,first you start slow walking,nyou start slowing down.,You're going back to simplicity.,After slow walking, you're goingnto learn how to drink water --,very simple, drinking waternfor maybe half an hour.,After this, you're going tonthe magnet chamber,,where you're going to creatensome magnet streams on your body.,Then after this,nyou go to crystal chamber.,After crystal chamber,nyou go to eye-gazing chamber,,after eye-gazing chamber, you go tona chamber where you are lying down.,So it's the three basic positionsnof the human body,,sitting, standing and lying.,And slow walking.,And there is a sound chamber.,And then after you've seen all of this,,and prepared yourselfnmentally and physically,,then you are ready to seensomething with a long duration,,like in immaterial art.,It can be music, it can be opera,nit can be a theater piece,,it can be film, it can be video dance.,You go to the long duration chairsnbecause now you are comfortable.,In the long duration chairs,,you're transported to the big placenwhere you're going to see the work.,And if you fall asleep,,which is very possiblenbecause it's been a long day,,you're going to bentransported to the parking lot. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you know, sleeping is very important.,In sleeping, you're still receiving art.,So in the parking lot you staynfor a certain amount of time,,and then after thisnyou just, you know, go back,,you see more of the things you like to see,or go home with your certificate. 
 So this institute right now is virtual.,Right now, I am justnmaking my institute in Brazil,,then it's going to be in Australia,,then it's coming here,nto Canada and everywhere.,And this is to experiencena kind of simple method,,how you go back to simplicitynin your own life.,Counting rice will be another thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, if you count ricenyou can make life, too.,How to count rice for six hours?,It's incredibly important.,You know, you go through this whole rangenof being bored, being angry,,being completely frustrated, not finishingnthe amount of rice you're counting.,And then this unbelievablenamount of peace you get,when satisfying work is finished --,or counting sand in the desert.,Or having the sound-isolated situation --,that you have headphones,nthat you don't hear anything,,and you're just therentogether without sound,,with the people experiencing silence,njust the simple silence. 
 We are always doing thingsnwe like in our life.,And this is why you're not changing.,You do things in life --,it's just nothing happensnif you always do things the same way.,But my method is to do thingsnI'm afraid of, the things I fear,,the things I don't know,,to go to territorynthat nobody's ever been. 
 And then also to include the failure.,I think failure is important,because if you go,nif you experiment, you can fail.,If you don't go into that areanand you don't fail,,you are actually repeating yourselfnover and over again.,And I think that human beingsnright now need a change,,and the only change to be madenis a personal level change.,You have to make the change on yourself.,Because the only waynto change consciousness,and to change the world around us,,is to start with yourself.,It's so easy to criticizenhow it's different,,the things in the worldnand they're not right,,and the governments are corruptednand there's hunger in the world,and there's wars -- the killing.,But what we do on the personal level --,what is our contributionnto this whole thing? 
 Can you turn to your neighbor,nthe one you don't know,,and look at them for two full minutesnin their eyes, right now? 
 (Chatter) 
 I'm asking two minutesnof your time, that's so little.,Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,ndon't be self-conscious.,Be relaxed.,And just look a completenstranger in your eyes, in his eyes. 
 (Silence),Thank you for trusting me. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you.,Thank you so much.(Guitar music starts) 
 (Cheers) 
 (Cheers) 
 (Music ends)Strap yourselves in,,we're going to Mars. 
 Not just a few astronauts --,thousands of peoplenare going to colonize Mars.,And I am telling younthat they're going to do this soon.,Some of you will end upnworking on projects on Mars,,and I guarantee that somenof your children will end up living there. 
 That probably sounds preposterous,,so I'm going to share with younhow and when that will happen.,But first I want to discussnthe obvious question:,Why the heck should we do this? 
 12 years ago,,I gave a TED talk on 10 waysnthe world could end suddenly.,We are incredibly vulnerablento the whims of our own galaxy.,A single, large asteroidncould take us out forever.,To survive we have to reachnbeyond the home planet.,Think what a tragedy it would be,if all that humans have accomplishednwere suddenly obliterated. 
 And there's another reason we should go:,exploration is in our DNA.,Two million years agonhumans evolved in Africa,and then slowly but surelynspread out across the entire planet,by reaching into the wildernessnthat was beyond their horizons.,This stuff is inside us.,And they prospered doing that.,Some of the greatest advancesnin civilization and technology,came because we explored. 
 Yes, we could do a lot of good,with the money it will takento establish a thriving colony on Mars.,And yes we should all be takingnfar better care of our own home planet.,And yes, I worry we could screw up Marsnthe way we've screwed up Earth. 
 But think for a moment,,what we had when John F. Kennedyntold us we would put a human on the moon.,He excited an entire generation to dream.,Think how inspired we will bento see a landing on Mars.,Perhaps then we will look back at Earth,and see that that isnone people instead of many,and perhaps thennwe will look back at Earth,,as we struggle to survive on Mars,,and realize how preciousnthe home planet is. 
 So let me tell you about the extraordinarynadventure we're about to undertake.,But first,,a few fascinating factsnabout where we're going.,This picture actually representsnthe true size of Mars compared to Earth.,Mars is not our sister planet.,It's far less than halfnthe size of the Earth,,and yet despite the factnthat it's smaller,,the surface area of Marsnthat you can stand on,is equivalent to the surface areanof the Earth that you can stand on,,because the Earthnis mostly covered by water. 
 The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --,100 times thinner than on Earth --,and it's not breathable,nit's 96 percent carbon dioxide. 
 It's really cold there.,The average temperaturenis minus 81 degrees,,although there isnquite a range of temperature. 
 A day on Mars is about as longnas a day on Earth,,plus about 39 minutes.,Seasons and years on Marsnare twice as long as they are on Earth. 
 And for anybody who wants to strapnon some wings and go flying one day,,Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,,and it's the kind of place,where you can jump over your carninstead of walk around it. 
 Now, as you can see,nMars isn't exactly Earth-like,,but it's by far the most livablenother place in our entire solar system. 
 Here's the problem.,Mars is a long way away,,a thousand times farther awaynfrom us than our own moon.,The Moon is 250,000 miles away,and it took Apollo astronautsnthree days to get there.,Mars is 250 million miles away,and it will take usneight months to get there --,240 days.,And that's only if we launchnon a very specific day,,at a very specific time,,once every two years,,when Mars and the Earthnare aligned just so,,so the distance that the rocketnwould have to travel will be the shortest.,240 days is a long time to spendntrapped with your colleagues in a tin can. 
 And meanwhile, our track recordnof getting to Mars is lousy.,We and the Russians,nthe Europeans, the Japanese,,the Chinese and the Indians,,have actually sent 44 rockets there,,and the vast majority of themnhave either missed or crashed.,Only about a third of the missionsnto Mars have been successful. 
 And we don't at the moment havena rocket big enough to get there anyway.,We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.,A couple of Saturn Vsnwould have gotten us there.,It was the most magnificentnmachine ever built by humans,,and it was the rocketnthat took us to the Moon.,But the last Saturn V was used in 1973nto launch the Skylab space station,,and we decided to donsomething called the shuttle,instead of continuing on to Marsnafter we landed on the Moon.,The biggest rocket we have now,is only half big enoughnto get us anything to Mars. 
 So getting to Mars is not going to be easy,and that brings upna really interesting question ...,how soon will the first humansnactually land here? 
 Now, some pundits thinknif we got there by 2050,,that'd be a pretty good achievement. 
 These days, NASA seems to be sayingnthat it can get humans to Mars by 2040.,Maybe they can.,I believe that they can getnhuman beings into Mars orbit by 2035.,But frankly,,I don't think they're going to bothernin 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,,because we will already be there. 
 We're going to land on Mars in 2027.,And the reason is,this man is determinednto make that happen.,His name is Elon Musk,nhe's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.,Now, he actually told menthat we would land on Mars by 2025,,but Elon Musk is morenoptimistic than I am --,and that's going a ways --,so I'm giving himna couple of years of slack.,Still ...,you've got to ask yourself,,can this guy really do thisnby 2025 or 2027? 
 Well, let's put a decade with Elon Muskninto a little perspective.,Where was this 10 years ago?,That's the Tesla electric automobile.,In 2005, a lot of peoplenin the automobile industry were saying,,we would not havena decent electric car for 50 years. 
 And where was that?,That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,,lifting six tons of suppliesnto the International Space Station.,10 years ago,,SpaceX had not launched anything,nor fired a rocket to anywhere.,So I think it's a pretty good bet,that the person who is revolutionizingnthe automobile industry,in less than 10 years,and the person who created an entirenrocket company in less than 10 years,will get us to Mars by 2027. 
 Now, you need to know this:,governments and robotsnno longer control this game.,Private companies are leaping into space,and they will be happynto take you to Mars. 
 And that raises a really big question.,Can we actually live there?,Now, NASA may not be ablento get us there until 2040,,or we may get therena long time before NASA,,but NASA has taken a huge responsibilitynin figuring out how we can live on Mars. 
 Let's look at the problem this way.,Here's what you need to live on Earth:,food, water, shelter and clothing.,And here's what you need to live on Mars:,all of the above, plus oxygen. 
 So let's look at the mostnimportant thing on this list first.,Water is the basisnof all life as we know it,,and it's far too heavy for us to carrynwater from the Earth to Mars to live,,so we have to find waternif our life is going to succeed on Mars.,And if you look at Mars,nit looks really dry,,it looks like the entirenplanet is a desert.,But it turns out that it's not.,The soil alone on Marsncontains up to 60 percent water.,And a number of orbiters that we stillnhave flying around Mars have shown us --,and by the way,nthat's a real photograph --,that lots of craters on Marsnhave a sheet of water ice in them.,It's not a bad place to start a colony. 
 Now, here's a view of a little dignthe Phoenix Lander did in 2008,,showing that just belownthe surface of the soil is ice --,that white stuff is ice.,In the second picture,,which is four days laternthan the first picture,,you can see thatnsome of it is evaporating. 
 Orbiters also tell us,that there are huge amountsnof underground water on Mars,as well as glaciers.,In fact, if only the water icenat the poles on Mars melted,,most of the planetnwould be under 30 feet of water.,So there's plenty of water there,,but most of it's ice,nmost of it's underground,,it takes a lot of energy to get itnand a lot of human labor. 
 This is a device cooked upnat the University of Washington,back in 1998.,It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.,And it turns out the Mars atmospherenis often 100 percent humid.,So this device can extractnall the water that humans will need,simply from the atmosphere on Mars. 
 Next we have to worrynabout what we will breathe.,Frankly, I was really shocked,to find out that NASAnhas this problem worked out.,This is a scientist at MITnnamed Michael Hecht.,And he's developed this machine, Moxie.,I love this thing.,It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,,that sucks in the Martian atmospherenand pumps out oxygen.,And you have to remember that CO2 --,carbon dioxide, which isn96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --,CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen. 
 Now, the next big rovernthat NASA sends to Mars in 2020,is going to have onenof these devices aboard,,and it will be ablento produce enough oxygen,to keep one person alive indefinitely.,But the secret to this --,and that's just for testing --,the secret to this is that this thingnwas designed from the get-go,to be scalable by a factor of 100. 
 Next, what will we eat?,Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,,but we're not going to be able to grow,more than 15 to 20 percentnof our food there,,at least not until water is runningnon the surface of Mars,and we actually have the probabilitynand the capability of planting crops.,In the meantime,,most of our food will arrive from Earth,,and it will be dried. 
 And then we need some shelter.,At first we can use inflatable,npressurized buildings,as well as the landers themselves.,But this really only worksnduring the daytime.,There is too much solar radiationnand too much radiation from cosmic rays.,So we really have to go underground. 
 Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,,by and large,nis perfect for making bricks.,And NASA has figured this one out, too.,They're going to thrownsome polymer plastic into the bricks,,shove them in a microwave oven,,and then you will be able to buildnbuildings with really thick walls.,Or we may choose to live undergroundnin caves or in lava tubes,,of which there are plenty. 
 And finally there's clothing.,On Earth we have milesnof atmosphere piled up on us,,which creates 15 pounds of pressurenon our bodies at all times,,and we're constantlynpushing out against that.,On Mars there's hardlynany atmospheric pressure.,So Dava Newman,,a scientist at MIT,,has created this sleek space suit.,It will keep us together,,block radiation and keep us warm. 
 So let's think about this for a minute.,Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...,we can do this.,We really can.,But it's still a little complicatednand a little difficult. 
 So that leads to the next big --,really big step --,in living the good life on Mars.,And that's terraforming the planet:,making it more like Earth,,reengineering an entire planet. 
 That sounds like a lot of hubris,,but the truth is,that the technology to do everythingnI'm about to tell you already exists. 
 First we've got to warm it up.,Mars is incredibly coldnbecause it has a very thin atmosphere.,The answer lies here, at the south polenand at the north pole of Mars,,both of which are covered,with an incredible amountnof frozen carbon dioxide --,dry ice.,If we heat it up,,it sublimes directly into the atmosphere,and thickens the atmospherenthe same way it does on Earth. 
 And as we know,,CO2 is an incrediblynpotent greenhouse gas.,Now, my favorite way of doing thisnis to erect a very, very large solar sail,and focus it --,it essentially serves as a mirror --,and focus it on the south polenof Mars at first.,As the planet spins, it will heat upnall that dry ice, sublime it,,and it will go into the atmosphere.,It actually won't take long,for the temperaturenon Mars to start rising,,probably less than 20 years. 
 Right now,,on a perfect day at the equator,,in the middle of summer on Mars,,temperatures cannactually reach 70 degrees,,but then they go downnto minus 100 at night. 
 (Laughter) 
 What we're shooting fornis a runaway greenhouse effect:,enough temperature risento see a lot of that ice on Mars --,especially the ice in the ground -- melt.,Then we get some real magic. 
 As the atmosphere gets thicker,neverything gets better.,We get more protection from radiation,,more atmosphere makes us warmer,nmakes the planet warmer,,so we get running water,and that makes crops possible.,Then more water vapor goes into the air,nforming yet another potent greenhouse gas.,It will rain and it will snow on Mars.,And a thicker atmospherenwill create enough pressure,so that we cannthrow away those space suits.,We only need about five poundsnof pressure to survive.,Eventually, Mars will be madento feel a lot like British Columbia. 
 We'll still be leftnwith the complicated problem,of making the atmosphere breathable,,and frankly that could taken1,000 years to accomplish.,But humans are amazingly smartnand incredibly adaptable. 
 There is no telling what our futurentechnology will be able to accomplish,and no telling what we can donwith our own bodies.,In biology right now,,we are on the very verge of beingnable to control our own genetics,,what the genesnin our own bodies are doing,,and certainly,,eventually, our own evolution.,We could end up with a speciesnof human being on Earth,that is slightly differentnfrom the species of human beings on Mars. 
 But what would you do there?nHow would you live?,It's going to benthe same as it is on Earth.,Somebody's going to start a restaurant,,somebody's going to build an iron foundry.,Someone will makendocumentary movies of Mars,and sell them on Earth.,Some idiot will start a reality TV show. 
 (Laughter) 
 There will be software companies,,there will be hotels, there will be bars. 
 This much is certain:,it will be the most disruptivenevent in our lifetimes,,and I think it will be the most inspiring. 
 Ask any 10-year-old girlnif she wants to go to Mars.,Children who are now in elementary schoolnare going to choose to live there. 
 Remember when we landednhumans on the Moon?,When that happened,npeople looked at each other and said,,"If we can do this, we can do anything.",What are they going to thinknwhen we actually form a colony on Mars? 
 Most importantly,,it will make us a spacefaring species.,And that means humans will survivenno matter what happens on Earth.,We will never be the last of our kind. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may not realize this,,but there are more bacteria in your bodynthan stars in our entire galaxy.,This fascinating universenof bacteria inside of us,is an integral part of our health,,and our technology is evolving so rapidly,that today we can program these bacterianlike we program computers. 
 Now, the diagram that you see here,,I know it looks likensome kind of sports play,,but it is actually a blueprint ofnthe first bacterial program I developed.,And like writing software,nwe can print and write DNA,into different algorithmsnand programs inside of bacteria.,What this program doesnis produces fluorescent proteins,in a rhythmic fashion,and generates a small molecule,that allows bacterianto communicate and synchronize,,as you're seeing in this movie.,The growing colony of bacterianthat you see here,is about the width of a human hair.,Now, what you can't seenis that our genetic program,instructs these bacterianto each produce small molecules,,and these molecules travel betweennthe thousands of individual bacteria,telling them when to turn on and off.,And the bacteria synchronizenquite well at this scale,,but because the molecule that synchronizesnthem together can only travel so fast,,in larger colonies of bacteria,nthis results in traveling waves,between bacteria that arenfar away from each other,,and you can see these waves goingnfrom right to left across the screen. 
 Now, our genetic programnrelies on a natural phenomenon,called quorum sensing,,in which bacteria trigger coordinatednand sometimes virulent behaviors,once they reach a critical density.,You can observe quorum sensingnin action in this movie,,where a growing colony of bacterianonly begins to glow,once it reaches a highnor critical density.,Our genetic program,continues producing thesenrhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins,as the colony grows outwards.,This particular movie and experimentnwe call The Supernova,,because it looks like an exploding star. 
 Now, besides programmingnthese beautiful patterns,,I wondered, what else can we getnthese bacteria to do?,And I decided to explorenhow we can program bacteria,to detect and treat diseasesnin our bodies like cancer.,One of the surprising facts about bacteria,is that they can naturally growninside of tumors.,This happens because typically tumors,are areas where the immune systemnhas no access,,and so bacteria find these tumors,and use them as a safe havennto grow and thrive.,We started using probiotic bacteria,which are safe bacterianthat have a health benefit,,and found thatnwhen orally delivered to mice,,these probiotics would selectivelyngrow inside of liver tumors.,We realized that the most convenient way,to highlight the presencenof the probiotics,,and hence, the presence of the tumors,,was to get these bacterianto produce a signal,that would be detectable in the urine,,and so we specificallynprogrammed these probiotics,to make a molecule that would changenthe color of your urine,to indicate the presence of cancer.,We went on to show that this technology,could sensitively and specificallyndetect liver cancer,,one that is challengingnto detect otherwise. 
 Now, since these bacterianspecifically localize to tumors,,we've been programming themnto not only detect cancer,but also to treat cancer,by producing therapeutic moleculesnfrom within the tumor environment,that shrink the existing tumors,,and we've been doing thisnusing quorum sensing programs,like you saw in the previous movies. 
 Altogether, imagine in the futurentaking a programmed probiotic,that could detect and treat cancer,,or even other diseases.,Our ability to program bacteria,and program life,opens up new horizons in cancer research,,and to share this vision,nI worked with artist Vik Muniz,to create the symbol of the universe,,made entirely out of bacterianor cancer cells.,Ultimately, my hope is that the beautynand purpose of this microscopic universe,can inspire new and creative approachesnfor the future of cancer research. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The FBI is responsiblenfor more terrorism plots,in the United States,than any other organization.,More than al Qaeda,,more than al Shabaab,,more than the Islamic State,,more than all of them combined. 
 This isn't likely how younthink about the FBI.,You probably think of FBI agentsngunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,,or arresting corrupt politicians. 
 After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,,the FBI became less concerned,with gangsters and ncrooked elected officials.,The new target became terrorists,,and the pursuit of terrorists nhas consumed the FBI. 
 Every year, the Bureau spendsn3.3 billion dollars,on domestic counterterrorism activities.,Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollarsncombined for organized crime,,financial fraud, public corruption,and all other types of traditionalncriminal activity. 
 I've spent years pouring throughnthe case files,of terrorism prosecutions in nthe United States,,and I've come to nthe conclusion that the FBI,is much better at creating terroristsnthan it is at catching terrorists. 
 In the 14 years since 9/11,,you can count about six real nterrorist attacks in the United States.,These include the Boston Marathon nbombings in 2013,,as well as failed attacks,,such as the time when na man named Faisal Shahzad,tried to deliver a car bombnto Times Square.,In those same 14 years,,the Bureau, however, has bragged,about how it's foiled dozensnof terrorism plots.,In all, the FBI has arrestednmore than 175 people,in aggressive, undercover nconterterrorism stings. 
 These operations, which are usuallynled by an informant,,provide the means and opportunity,,and sometimes even the idea,,for mentally ill and neconomically desperate people,to become what we now term terrorists. 
 After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:,never again.,Never another attack on American soil.,FBI agents were told to find terroristsnbefore they struck.,To do this, agents recruited a networknof more than 15,000 informants nationwide,,all looking for anyone who nmight be dangerous.,An informant can earn n100,000 dollars or more,for every terrorism case nthey bring to the FBI.,That's right, the FBI is payingnmostly criminals and con men,six figures to spy on communitiesnin the United States,,but mostly Muslim American communities. 
 These informants nab people like nAbu Khalid Abdul-Latif,and Walli Mujahidh.,Both are mentally ill.,Abdul-Latif had a history of huffingngasoline and attempting suicide.,Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,,he had trouble distinguishing betweennreality and fantasy.,In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men,for conspiring to attack a militarynrecruiting station outside Seattle,with weapons provided, nof course, by the FBI.,The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,,a convicted rapist and child molester,who was paid 90,000 dollars nfor his work on the case.,This isn't an outlier. 
 In 2009, an FBI informantnwho had fled Pakistan on murder charges,led four men in a plot to bomb nsynagogues in the Bronx.,The lead defendant was James Cromitie,,a broke Walmart employeenwith a history of mental problems.,And the informant had offered nhim 250,000 dollars,if he participated in that plot.,There are many more examples. 
 Today, The Interceptnpublished my new story,about a counterterrorism sting in Tampaninvolving Sami Osmakac,,a young man who was living nnear Tampa, Florida.,Osmakac also had nschizoaffective disorder.,He too was broke,,and he had no connections to ninternational terrorist groups.,Nonetheless,,an FBI informant gave him a job,nhanded him money,,introduced him to an undercover agentnposing as a terrorist,,and lured him in a plotnto bomb an Irish bar. 
 But here's what's interesting:,The lead undercover agent --,you can see him in this picturenwith his face blurred --,would go back to the Tampa field officenwith his recording equipment on.,Behind closed doors,,FBI agents admitted that whatnthey were doing was farcical.,A federal judge doesn't want younto hear about these conversations.,He sealed the transcripts and placednthem under a protective order,in an attempt to prevent someone like menfrom doing something like this.,Behind closed doors, the lead agent,,the squad supervisor,,described their would-be terrorist,as a "retarded fool who didn't havena pot to piss in.",They described his terrorist ambitions,as wishy-washy andna pipe dream scenario. 
 But that didn't stop the FBI.,They provided Sami Osmakac neverything he needed.,They gave him a car bomb,nthey gave him an AK-47,,they helped him make a so-callednmartyrdom video,,and they even gave nhim money for a taxi cab,so that he could get to wherenthey wanted him to go.,As they were working the sting,,the squad supervisor tells his agentsnhe wanted a Hollywood ending.,And he got a Hollywood ending.,When Sami Osmakac attemptednto deliver what he thought,was a car bomb,,he was arrested, convicted and nsentenced to 40 years in prison. 
 Sami Osmakac isn't alone.,He's one of more than n175 so-called terrorists,,for whom the FBI has created nHollywood endings.,U.S. government officials call thisnthe War on Terror.,It's really just theater,,a national security theater,,with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac,unwitting actors in a ncarefully choreographed production,brought to you by the FBI. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Tom Rielly: So, those are somenpretty strong accusations,,pretty strong charges.,How can you back this up? 
 Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010,when I received a grant from the nInvestigative Reporting Program,at U.C. Berkeley,,and a research assistant and I,put together a databasenof all terrorism prosecutions,at the time during nthe first decade after 9/11.,And we used the court filento find out whether,the defendants had any connectionsnto international terrorist groups,,whether an informant was used,,and whether the informantnplayed the role of an agent provocateur,by providing the means and opportunity.,And we submitted that to the FBI,and we asked them to respondnto our database.,If they believed there were any errors,,we asked them to tell us what they werenand we'd go back and check,and they never challenged anynof our findings.,Later, I used that data nin a magazine article,and later in my book,,and on appearances on placesnlike CBS and NPR,,they were offered that opportunity again,to say, "Trevor Aaronson's nfindings are wrong.",And they've neverncome forward and said,,"These are the problemsnwith those findings.",So the data has since been used nby groups like Human Rights Watch,on its recent report on nthese types of sting operations.,And so far, the FBI has never nreally responded,to these charges that it's reallynnot catching terrorists,so much as it's catchingnmentally ill people,that it can dress up as terrorists nin these types of sting operations. 
 TR: So The Intercept is that newninvestigative journalism website,,that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.,Tell us about your article nand why there. 
 TA: The Intercept seemed to benthe most logical place for this,because my article is nreally leveraging the fact that,a source had leaked to mentranscripts of these,private FBI conversationsnthat a federal judge had sealed,based on the government's claim nthat their release,would irreparably damage nthe U.S. government's,law enforcement strategy.,So a place like The Interceptnwas set up to protect journalists,and publish their work,when they're dealing with nvery sensitive matters like this.,So my story in The Intercept, nwhich was just published today,,tells the story of how Sami Osmakacnwas set up in this FBI sting,and goes into much greater detail.,In this talk, I could onlynhighlight the things that they said,,such as calling him a "retarded fool.",But it was much more elaborate,,they went to great lengthsnto put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,,which he then used to purchase weaponsnfrom the undercover agent.,When he went to trial,,the central piece of evidence nwas that he paid for these weapons,,when in truth, these transcripts shownhow the FBI orchestrated,someone who was essentiallynmentally ill and broke,to get money to then npay for weapons,that they could then charge himnin a conspiracy for. 
 TR: One final question.,Less than 10 days ago,,the FBI arrested some potential nISIS suspects in Brooklyn,,saying that they mightnbe headed to Syria,,and were those real,nor examples of more of the same? 
 TA: Well so far, we only knownwhat's come out in the court file,,but they seem to suggest it's anothernexample of the same.,These types of sting operations nhave moved from flavor to flavor.,So initially it was al Qaeda plots,,and now the Islamic Statenis the current flavor.,What's worth noting about that casenis that the three men that were charged,only began the plot to go to Syria,after the introductionnof the FBI informant,,and in fact, the FBI informant had helpednthem with the travel documents,that they needed.,In kind of a comical turn nin that particular case,,one of the defendant's mothernhad found out,that he was interested in going to Syrianand had hid his passport.,So it's unclear that even if he hadnshowed up at the airport,,that he ever could have gone anywhere.,So yes, there are people who mightnbe interested in joining the Islamic State,in the United States,,and those are people that the United nStates government should be looking at,to see if they're interestednin violence here.,In this particular case, givennthe evidence that's so far come out,,it suggests the FBI madenit possible for these guys,to move along in a plan to go to Syria,when they were never close nto that in the first place. 
 TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing.nTA: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Most of us think of motionnas a very visual thing.,If I walk across this stagenor gesture with my hands while I speak,,that motion is something that you can see.,But there's a world of important motionnthat's too subtle for the human eye,,and over the past few years,,we've started to find that cameras,can often see this motionneven when humans can't. 
 So let me show you what I mean.,On the left here, you see videonof a person's wrist,,and on the right, you see videonof a sleeping infant,,but if I didn't tell younthat these were videos,,you might assume that you were lookingnat two regular images,,because in both cases,,these videos appear to benalmost completely still.,But there's actually a lotnof subtle motion going on here,,and if you were to touchnthe wrist on the left,,you would feel a pulse,,and if you were to holdnthe infant on the right,,you would feel the risenand fall of her chest,as she took each breath.,And these motions carryna lot of significance,,but they're usuallyntoo subtle for us to see,,so instead, we have to observe them,through direct contact, through touch. 
 But a few years ago,,my colleagues at MIT developednwhat they call a motion microscope,,which is software that findsnthese subtle motions in video,and amplifies them so that theynbecome large enough for us to see.,And so, if we use their softwarenon the left video,,it lets us see the pulse in this wrist,,and if we were to count that pulse,,we could even figure outnthis person's heart rate.,And if we used the same softwarenon the right video,,it lets us see each breathnthat this infant takes,,and we can use this as a contact-free waynto monitor her breathing. 
 And so this technology is really powerfulnbecause it takes these phenomena,that we normally havento experience through touch,and it lets us capture them visuallynand non-invasively. 
 So a couple years ago, I started workingnwith the folks that created that software,,and we decided to pursue a crazy idea.,We thought, it's coolnthat we can use software,to visualize tiny motions like this,,and you can almost think of itnas a way to extend our sense of touch.,But what if we could do the same thingnwith our ability to hear?,What if we could use videonto capture the vibrations of sound,,which are just another kind of motion,,and turn everything that we seeninto a microphone? 
 Now, this is a bit of a strange idea,,so let me try to put itnin perspective for you.,Traditional microphonesnwork by converting the motion,of an internal diaphragmninto an electrical signal,,and that diaphragm is designednto move readily with sound,so that its motion can be recordednand interpreted as audio.,But sound causes all objects to vibrate.,Those vibrations are just usuallyntoo subtle and too fast for us to see. 
 So what if we record themnwith a high-speed camera,and then use softwarento extract tiny motions,from our high-speed video,,and analyze those motions to figure outnwhat sounds created them?,This would let us turn visible objectsninto visual microphones from a distance.,And so we tried this out,,and here's one of our experiments,,where we took this potted plantnthat you see on the right,and we filmed it with a high-speed camera,while a nearby loudspeakernplayed this sound. 
 (Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 And so here's the video that we recorded,,and we recorded it at thousandsnof frames per second,,but even if you look very closely,,all you'll see are some leaves,that are pretty muchnjust sitting there doing nothing,,because our sound only moved those leavesnby about a micrometer.,That's one ten-thousandth of a centimeter,,which spans somewhere betweenna hundredth and a thousandth,of a pixel in this image.,So you can squint all you want,,but motion that small is pretty muchnperceptually invisible.,But it turns out that somethingncan be perceptually invisible,and still be numerically significant,,because with the right algorithms,,we can take this silent,nseemingly still video,and we can recover this sound. 
 (Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 (Applause) 
 So how is this possible?,How can we get so much informationnout of so little motion?,Well, let's say that those leavesnmove by just a single micrometer,,and let's say that that shifts our imagenby just a thousandth of a pixel.,That may not seem like much,,but a single frame of video,may have hundreds of thousandsnof pixels in it,,and so if we combine allnof the tiny motions that we see,from across that entire image,,then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel,can start to add upnto something pretty significant. 
 On a personal note, we were pretty psychednwhen we figured this out.,(Laughter),But even with the right algorithm,,we were still missingna pretty important piece of the puzzle.,You see, there are a lot of factorsnthat affect when and how well,this technique will work.,There's the object and how far away it is;,there's the cameranand the lens that you use;,how much light is shining on the objectnand how loud your sound is.,And even with the right algorithm,,we had to be very carefulnwith our early experiments,,because if we gotnany of these factors wrong,,there was no way to tellnwhat the problem was.,We would just get noise back.,And so a lot of our earlynexperiments looked like this.,And so here I am,,and on the bottom left, you can kind ofnsee our high-speed camera,,which is pointed at a bag of chips,,and the whole thing is litnby these bright lamps.,And like I said, we had to benvery careful in these early experiments,,so this is how it went down. 
 (Video) Abe Davis: Three, two, one, go.,Mary had a little lamb!nLittle lamb! Little lamb! 
 (Laughter) 
 AD: So this experimentnlooks completely ridiculous.,(Laughter),I mean, I'm screaming at a bag of chips --,(Laughter) --,and we're blasting it with so much light,,we literally melted the first bagnwe tried this on. (Laughter),But ridiculous as this experiment looks,,it was actually really important,,because we were ablento recover this sound. 
 (Audio) Mary had a little lamb!nLittle lamb! Little lamb! 
 (Applause) 
 AD: And this was really significant,,because it was the first timenwe recovered intelligible human speech,from silent video of an object.,And so it gave us this point of reference,,and gradually we could startnto modify the experiment,,using different objectsnor moving the object further away,,using less light or quieter sounds.,And we analyzed all of these experiments,until we really understoodnthe limits of our technique,,because once we understood those limits,,we could figure out how to push them. 
 And that led to experiments like this one,,where again, I'm going to speaknto a bag of chips,,but this time we've moved our cameranabout 15 feet away,,outside, behind a soundproof window,,and the whole thing is litnby only natural sunlight.,And so here's the video that we captured.,And this is what things sounded likenfrom inside, next to the bag of chips. 
 (Audio) Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthat lamb was sure to go. 
 AD: And here's what we were ablento recover from our silent video,captured outside behind that window. 
 (Audio) Mary had a little lambnwhose fleece was white as snow,,and everywhere that Mary went,nthat lamb was sure to go. 
 (Applause) 
 AD: And there are other waysnthat we can push these limits as well.,So here's a quieter experiment,where we filmed some earphonesnplugged into a laptop computer,,and in this case, our goal was to recovernthe music that was playing on that laptop,from just silent video,of these two little plastic earphones,,and we were able to do this so well,that I could even Shazam our results.,(Laughter) 
 (Music: "Under Pressure" by Queen) 
 (Applause) 
 And we can also push thingsnby changing the hardware that we use.,Because the experimentsnI've shown you so far,were done with a camera,na high-speed camera,,that can record videonabout a 100 times faster,than most cell phones,,but we've also found a waynto use this technique,with more regular cameras,,and we do that by taking advantagenof what's called a rolling shutter.,You see, most camerasnrecord images one row at a time,,and so if an object movesnduring the recording of a single image,,there's a slight time delaynbetween each row,,and this causes slight artifacts,that get coded into each frame of a video.,And so what we foundnis that by analyzing these artifacts,,we can actually recover soundnusing a modified version of our algorithm.,So here's an experiment we did,where we filmed a bag of candy,while a nearby loudspeaker played,the same "Mary Had a Little Lamb"nmusic from before,,but this time, we used just a regularnstore-bought camera,,and so in a second, I'll play for younthe sound that we recovered,,and it's going to soundndistorted this time,,but listen and see if you can stillnrecognize the music. 
 (Audio: "Mary Had a Little Lamb") 
 And so, again, that sounds distorted,,but what's really amazing herenis that we were able to do this,with somethingnthat you could literally run out,and pick up at a Best Buy. 
 So at this point,,a lot of people see this work,,and they immediately thinknabout surveillance.,And to be fair,,it's not hard to imagine how you might usenthis technology to spy on someone.,But keep in mind that there's alreadyna lot of very mature technology,out there for surveillance.,In fact, people have been using lasers,to eavesdrop on objectsnfrom a distance for decades.,But what's really new here,,what's really different,,is that now we have a waynto picture the vibrations of an object,,which gives us a new lensnthrough which to look at the world,,and we can use that lens,to learn not just about forces like soundnthat cause an object to vibrate,,but also about the object itself. 
 And so I want to take a step back,and think about how that might changenthe ways that we use video,,because we usually use videonto look at things,,and I've just shown you how we can use it,to listen to things.,But there's another important waynthat we learn about the world:,that's by interacting with it.,We push and pull and poke and prod things.,We shake things and see what happens.,And that's something that videonstill won't let us do,,at least not traditionally.,So I want to show you some new work,,and this is based on an idea I hadnjust a few months ago,,so this is actually the first timenI've shown it to a public audience.,And the basic idea is that we're goingnto use the vibrations in a video,to capture objects in a waynthat will let us interact with them,and see how they react to us. 
 So here's an object,,and in this case, it's a wire figurenin the shape of a human,,and we're going to film that objectnwith just a regular camera.,So there's nothing specialnabout this camera.,In fact, I've actually done thisnwith my cell phone before.,But we do want to see the object vibrate,,so to make that happen,,we're just going to bang a little bitnon the surface where it's resting,while we record this video. 
 So that's it: just five secondsnof regular video,,while we bang on this surface,,and we're going to usenthe vibrations in that video,to learn about the structuralnand material properties of our object,,and we're going to use that informationnto create something new and interactive.,And so here's what we've created.,And it looks like a regular image,,but this isn't an image,nand it's not a video,,because now I can take my mouse,and I can start interactingnwith the object.,And so what you see here,is a simulation of how this object,would respond to new forcesnthat we've never seen before,,and we created it from justnfive seconds of regular video. 
 (Applause) 
 And so this is a really powerfulnway to look at the world,,because it lets us predictnhow objects will respond,to new situations,,and you could imagine, for instance,nlooking at an old bridge,and wondering what would happen,nhow would that bridge hold up,if I were to drive my car across it.,And that's a questionnthat you probably want to answer,before you start drivingnacross that bridge.,And of course, there are going to benlimitations to this technique,,just like there werenwith the visual microphone,,but we found that it worksnin a lot of situations,that you might not expect,,especially if you give it longer videos. 
 So for example,nhere's a video that I captured,of a bush outside of my apartment,,and I didn't do anything to this bush,,but by capturing a minute-long video,,a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations,that we could learn enough about this bushnto create this simulation.,(Applause),And so you could imagine giving thisnto a film director,,and letting him control, say,,the strength and direction of windnin a shot after it's been recorded.,Or, in this case, we pointed our cameranat a hanging curtain,,and you can't even seenany motion in this video,,but by recording a two-minute-long video,,natural air currents in this room,created enough subtle,nimperceptible motions and vibrations,that we could learn enoughnto create this simulation. 
 And ironically,,we're kind of used to havingnthis kind of interactivity,when it comes to virtual objects,,when it comes to video gamesnand 3D models,,but to be able to capture this informationnfrom real objects in the real world,using just simple, regular video,,is something new that hasna lot of potential. 
 So here are the amazing peoplenwho worked with me on these projects.,(Applause) 
 And what I've shown you todaynis only the beginning.,We've just started to scratch the surface,of what you can donwith this kind of imaging,,because it gives us a new way,to capture our surroundingsnwith common, accessible technology.,And so looking to the future,,it's going to benreally exciting to explore,what this can tell us about the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.,I was the son of an aerospace engineer.,I lived and breathed the Apollo program.,We either saw the launchesnfrom our backyard,or we saw it by drivingnin the hour over to the Cape.,I was impressed by, obviously,nspace and everything about it,,but I was most impressednby the engineering that went into it. 
 Behind me you see an amazing view,,a picture that was takennfrom the International Space Station,,and it shows a portion of our planet,that's rarely seen and rarely studied,and almost never explored.,That place is called the stratosphere. 
 If you start on the planetnand you go up and up and up,,it gets colder and colder and colder,,until you reach the beginningnof the stratosphere,,and then an amazing thing happens.,It gets colder at a much slower rate,nand then it starts warming up,,and then it gets warmer and warmer,until the point where you cannalmost survive without any protection,,about zero degrees,,and then you end upngetting colder and colder,,and that's the top of the stratosphere.,It is one of the least accessiblenplaces on our planet.,Most often, when it's visited,,it's by astronautsnwho are blazing up at it,at probably several timesnthe speed of sound,,and they get a few seconds on the way up,,and then they get this blazingnball of fire coming back in,,on the way back in. 
 But the question I asked is, is itnpossible to linger in the stratosphere?,Is it possible to experiencenthe stratosphere?,Is it possible to explorenthe stratosphere? 
 I studied this usingnmy favorite search engine,for quite a while, about a year,,and then I made a scary phone call.,It was a reference from a friend of minento call Taber MacCallum,from Paragon SpacenDevelopment Corporation,,and I asked him the question:,is it possible to build,a system to go into the stratosphere?,And he said it was.,And after a period of about three years,nwe proceeded to do just that.,And on October 24 of last year,,in this suit,,I started on the ground,,I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --,but who's counting? 
 (Laughter) 
 Came back to Earthnat speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.,It was a four-minutenand 27-second descent.,And when I got to 10,000 feet,nI opened a parachute and I landed. 
 (Applause) 
 But this is really a science talk,nand it's really an engineering talk,,and what was amazing to menabout that experience,is that Taber said, yes, I thinknwe can build a stratospheric suit,,and more than that, come down tomorrow,and let's talk to the teamnthat formed the core of the group,that actually built it.,And they did somethingnwhich I think is important,,which is they tooknthe analogy of scuba diving.,So in scuba diving,,you have a self-contained system.,You have everythingnthat you could ever need.,You have a scuba tank.,You have a wetsuit.,You have visibility.,And that scuba is exactly this system,,and we're going to launch itninto the stratosphere. 
 Three years later, this is what we have.,We've got an amazing suitnthat was made by ILC Dover.,ILC Dover was the companynthat made all of the Apollo suits,and all of the extravehicularnactivity suits.,They had never sold a suit commercially,,only to the government,,but they sold one to me,nwhich I am very grateful for.,Up here we have a parachute.nThis was all about safety.,Everyone on the team knew,that I have a wifenand two small children --,10 and 15 --,and I wanted to come back safely.,So there's a main parachutenand a reserve parachute,,and if I do nothing,,the reserve parachute is going to opennbecause of an automatic opening device.,The suit itselfncan protect me from the cold.,This area in the front herenhas thermal protection.,It will actually heat waternthat will wrap around my body.,It has two redundant oxygen tanks.,Even if I was to getna quarter-inch hole in this suit,,which is extremely unlikely,,this system would still protect menfrom the low pressure of space. 
 The main advantage of this systemnis weight and complexity.,So the system weighs about 500 pounds,,and if you compare it to the other attemptnrecently to go up in the stratosphere,,they used a capsule.,And to do a capsule, there's an amazingnamount of complexity that goes into it,,and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,,and to raise 3,000 poundsnto an altitude of 135,000 feet,,which was my target altitude,,it would have taken a balloonnthat was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.,Because I only weighedn500 pounds in this system,,we could do it with a balloonnthat was five times smaller than that,,and that allowed us to use a launch systemnthat was dramatically simpler,than what needs to be donenfor a much larger balloon. 
 So with that, I want to take younto Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.,We had an amazing teamnthat got up in the middle of the night.,And here's the suit.,Again, this is using the front loadernthat you'll see in a second,,and I want to play you a videonof the actual launch.,Roswell's a great placento launch balloons,,but it's a fantastic placento land under a parachute,,especially when you're going to landn70 miles away from the place you started.,That's a helium truck in the background.,It's darkness.,I've already spent about an hournand a half pre-breathing.,And then here you see the suit going on.,It takes about an hour to get the suit on.,Astronauts get this really nicenair-conditioned van,to go to the launch pad,nbut I got a front loader. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see the top.nYou can see the balloon up there.,That's where the helium is.,This is Dave clearing the airspacenwith the FAA for 15 miles.,And there we go. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's me waving with my left hand.,The reason I'm waving with my left hand,is because on the right handnis the emergency cutaway. 
 (Laughter) 
 My team forbade menfrom using my right hand.,So the trip up is beautiful.nIt's kind of like Google Earth in reverse. 
 (Laughter) 
 It took two hoursnand seven minutes to go up,,and it was the most peacefulntwo hours and seven minutes.,I was mostly trying to relax.,My heart rate was very low,and I was trying not to usenvery much oxygen.,You can see how the fieldsnin the background,are relatively big at this point,,and you can see me going up and up. 
 It's interesting here,nbecause if you look,,I'm right over the airport,nand I'm probably at 50,000 feet,,but immediately I'm about to goninto a stratospheric wind,of over 120 miles an hour.,This is my flight director telling menthat I had just gone higher,than anybody elsenhad ever gone in a balloon,,and I was about 4,000 feet from release.,This is what it looks like.,You can see the darkness of space,nthe curvature of the Earth,,the fragile planet below.,I'm practicing my emergency proceduresnmentally right now.,If anything goes wrong,nI want to be ready.,And the main thing that I want to do here,is to have a release and fallnand stay completely stable. 
 (Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?,Five. Four. Three. Two. One. 
 Alan Eustace: There's the balloonngoing by, fully inflated at this point.,And there you can see a drogue parachute,nwhich I'll demonstrate in just a second,,because that's really important.,There's the balloonngoing by a second time.,Right now, I'm aboutnat the speed of sound.,There's nothing for me to tellnit's the speed of sound,,and very soon I will actually benas fast as I ever get,,822 miles an hour. 
 (Video) Ground control: We lost the data. 
 AE: So now I'm down low right now,and you can basically seenthe parachute come out right there.,At this point, I'm very happynthat there's a parachute out.,I thought I was the only one happy,,but it turns out mission controlnwas really happy as well.,The really nice thing about thisnis the moment I opened --,I had a close of friend of mine,nBlikkies, my parachute guy.,He flew in another airplane,nand he actually jumped out,and landed right next to me.,He was my wingman on the descent.,This is my landing, but it's probably morenproperly called a crash. 
 (Laughter) 
 I hate to admit it, but this wasn'tneven close to my worst landing. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Video) Man: How are you doing? 
 AE: Hi there!,Yay. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I want to tell you one thing,that you might not have seennin that video,,but one of the most critical partsnof the entire thing was the release,and what happens right after you release.,And what we tried to do was usensomething called a drogue parachute,,and a drogue parachutenwas there to stabilize me.,And I'll show you one of those right now.,If any of you have everngone tandem skydiving,,you probably used one of these.,But the problem with one of these things,is right when you release,nyou're in zero gravity.,So it's very easy for thisnto just turn right around you.,And before you know it,nyou can be tangled up or spinning,,or you can release this drogue late,,in which case what happensnis you're going down at 800 miles an hour,,and this thing is going to destroy itself,and not be very useful.,But the guys at United ParachutenTechnologies came up with this idea,,and it was a roll that looks like that,,but watch what happens when I pull it out.,It's forming a pipe.,This pipe is so solid,that you can take this drogue parachutenand wrap it around,,and there's no waynit will ever tangle with you.,And that preventedna very serious potential problem. 
 So nothing is possiblenwithout an amazing team of people.,The core of this was about 20 people,that worked on this for the three years,,and they were incredible.,People asked me what the best partnof this whole thing was,,and it was a chancento work with the best experts,in meteorology and ballooningnand parachute technology,and environmental systemsnand high altitude medicine.,It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dreamnto work with that group of people.,And I also at the same timenwanted to thank my friends at Google,,both for supporting me during this effort,and also covering for menin the times that I was away.,But there's one other groupnI wanted to thank, and that's my family.,Yay. 
 (Applause) 
 I would constantly give them speechesnabout the safety of technology,,and they weren't hearing any of it.,It was super hard on them,,and the only reasonnthat my wife put up with it,was because I came back incredibly happynafter each of the 250 tests,,and she didn't wantnto take that away from me.,So I want to close with a story.,My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,nshe and I were in the car,,and we were driving down the road,nand she was sitting there,,and she had this idea, and she goes,n"Dad, I've got this idea.",And so I listened to her ideanand I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible.",And she looks at me,and she goes, "Dad,nafter what you just did,,how can you call anything impossible?",And I laughed, and I said,n"OK, it's not impossible,,it's just very, very hard.",And then I paused for a second,nand I said, "Katelyn,,it may not be impossible,nit may not even be very, very hard,,it's just that I don't know how to do it." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For the past decade,,I've been studying non-state armed groups:,armed organizations like terrorists,ninsurgents or militias.,I document what these groups donwhen they're not shooting.,My goal is to better understandnthese violent actors,and to study ways to encourage transitionnfrom violent engagement,to nonviolent confrontation.,I work in the field, in the policy worldnand in the library. 
 Understanding non-state armed groupsnis key to solving most ongoing conflict,,because war has changed.,It used to be a contest between states.,No longer.,It is now a conflict between statesnand non-state actors.,For example, of the 216 peace agreements,signed between 1975 and 2011,,196 of them were between a statenand a non-state actor.,So we need to understand these groups;nwe need to either engage them,or defeat them in any conflict resolutionnprocess that has to be successful. 
 So how do we do that?,We need to know what makesnthese organizations tick.,We know a lot aboutnhow they fight, why they fight,,but no one looks at what they're doingnwhen they're not fighting.,Yet, armed strugglenand unarmed politics are related.,It is all part of the same organization.,We cannot understand these groups,nlet alone defeat them,,if we don't have the full picture. 
 And armed groups todaynare complex organizations.,Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,,known for its violentnconfrontation against Israel.,But since its creation in the early 1980s,,Hezbollah has also set upna political party,,a social-service network,nand a military apparatus.,Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,,known for its suicide attacksnagainst Israel,,also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.,So these groups do way morenthan just shoot.,They multi-task.,They set up complexncommunication machines --,radio stations, TV channels,,Internet websitesnand social media strategies.,And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,,printed in Englishnand published to recruit.,Armed groups also investnin complex fund-raising --,not looting, but setting upnprofitable businesses;,for example, construction companies.,Now, these activities are keys.,They allow these groupsnto increase their strength,,increase their funds,,to better recruitnand to build their brand. 
 Armed groups also do something else:,they build stronger bondsnwith the population,by investing in social services.,They build schools, they run hospitals,,they set up vocational-training programsnor micro-loan programs.,Hezbollah offers allnof these services and more.,Armed groups also seeknto win the population over,by offering somethingnthat the state is not providing:,safety and security.,The initial rise of the Talibannin war-torn Afghanistan,,or even the beginningnof the ascent of ISIS,,can be understood also by lookingnat these groups' efforts,to provide security.,Now, unfortunately, in these cases,,the provision of securityncame at an unbearably high price,for the population.,But in general, providingnsocial services fills a gap,,a governance gap left by the government,,and allows these groupsnto increase their strength,and their power.,For example, the 2006 electoral victorynof the Palestinian Hamas,cannot be understood withoutnacknowledging the group's social work. 
 Now, this is a really complex picture,,yet in the West,nwhen we look at armed groups,,we only think of the violent side.,But that's not enough to understandnthese groups' strength,,strategy or long-term vision.,These groups are hybrid.,They rise because they fill a gapnleft by the government,,and they emergento be both armed and political,,engage in violent strugglenand provide governance. 
 And the more these organizationsnare complex and sophisticated,,the less we can think of themnas the opposite of a state.,Now, what do you callna group like Hezbollah?,They run part of a territory,nthey administer all their functions,,they pick up the garbage,nthey run the sewage system.,Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?,Or maybe something else,nsomething different and new?,And what about ISIS?,The lines are blurred.,We live in a world of states,nnon-states, and in-between,,and the more states are weak,nlike in the Middle East today,,the more non-state actorsnstep in and fill that gap.,This matters for governments,nbecause to counter these groups,,they will have to invest morenin non-military tools.,Filling that governance gap,has to be at the centernof any sustainable approach.,This also matters very muchnfor peacemaking and peacebuilding.,If we better understand armed groups,,we will better knownwhat incentives to offer,to encourage the transitionnfrom violence to nonviolence. 
 So in this new contestnbetween states and non-states,,military power can win some battles,,but it will not give usnpeace nor stability.,To achieve these objectives,,what we need is a long-term investmentnin filling that security gap,,in filling that governance gap,that allowed these groupsnto thrive in the first place. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For more than 100 years,,the telephone companies have providednwiretapping assistance to governments. 
 For much of this time,nthis assistance was manual.,Surveillance took place manuallynand wires were connected by hand.,Calls were recorded to tape.,But as in so many other industries,,computing has changed everything.,The telephone companiesnbuilt surveillance features,into the very core of their networks.,I want that to sink in for a second:,Our telephones and the networksnthat carry our calls,were wired for surveillance first.,First and foremost. 
 So what that means is thatnwhen you're talking to your spouse,,your children, a colleaguenor your doctor on the telephone,,someone could be listening.,Now, that someone mightnbe your own government;,it could also be another government,na foreign intelligence service,,or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker,or any other party that breaks intonthe surveillance system,,that hacks into the surveillance systemnof the telephone companies. 
 But while the telephone companiesnhave built surveillance as a priority,,Silicon Valley companies have not.,And increasingly,nover the last couple years,,Silicon Valley companies have builtnstrong encryption technology,into their communications products,that makes surveillancenextremely difficult. 
 For example, many of younmight have an iPhone,,and if you use an iPhonento send a text message,to other people who have an iPhone,,those text messagesncannot easily be wiretapped.,And in fact, according to Apple,,they're not able to even seenthe text messages themselves.,Likewise, if you use FaceTimento make an audio call,or a video call with one of yournfriends or loved ones,,that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped. 
 And it's not just Apple.,WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook,and used by hundreds of millionsnof people around the world,,also has built strongnencryption technology into its product,,which means that peoplenin the Global South can easily communicate,without their governments,noften authoritarian,,wiretapping their text messages. 
 So, after 100 years of being ablento listen to any telephone call --,anytime, anywhere --,you might imagine that governmentnofficials are not very happy.,And in fact, that's what's happening.,Government officials are extremely mad.,And they're not mad becausenthese encryption tools are now available.,What upsets them the most,is that the tech companies have builtnencryption features into their products,and turned them on by default.,It's the default piece that matters. 
 In short, the tech companiesnhave democratized encryption.,And so, government officialsnlike British Prime Minister David Cameron,,they believe that all communications --nemails, texts, voice calls --,all of these should benavailable to governments,,and encryption is making that difficult. 
 Now, look -- I'm extremely sympatheticnto their point of view.,We live in a dangerous timenin a dangerous world,,and there really are bad people out there.,There are terrorists and othernserious national security threats,that I suspect we all wantnthe FBI and the NSA to monitor. 
 But those surveillancenfeatures come at a cost.,The reason for that is,that there is no such thingnas a terrorist laptop,,or a drug dealer's cell phone.,We all use the samencommunications devices.,What that means is thatnif the drug dealers' telephone calls,or the terrorists' telephone callsncan be intercepted,,then so can the rest of ours, too.,And I think we really need to ask:,Should a billion peoplenaround the world be using devices,that are wiretap friendly? 
 So the scenario of hacking of surveillancensystems that I've described --,this is not imaginary.,In 2009,,the surveillance systems that Googlenand Microsoft built into their networks --,the systems that they use to respondnto lawful surveillance requests,from the police --,those systems were compromisednby the Chinese government,,because the Chinese governmentnwanted to figure out,which of their own agentsnthe US government was monitoring. 
 By the same token,,in 2004, the surveillance systemnbuilt into the network,of Vodafone Greece --nGreece's largest telephone company --,was compromised by an unknown entity,,and that feature,nthe surveillance feature,,was used to wiretapnthe Greek Prime Minister,and members of the Greek cabinet.,The foreign government or hackersnwho did that were never caught. 
 And really, this gets to the very problemnwith these surveillance features,,or backdoors.,When you build a backdoorninto a communications network,or piece of technology,,you have no way of controllingnwho's going to go through it.,You have no way of controlling,whether it'll be used by your sidenor the other side,,by good guys, or by bad guys. 
 And so for that reason,nI think that it's better,to build networksnto be as secure as possible.,Yes, this means that in the future,,encryption is going to makenwiretapping more difficult.,It means that the policenare going to have a tougher time,catching bad guys.,But the alternative would meannto live in a world,where anyone's calls or anyone'sntext messages could be surveilled,by criminals, by stalkersnand by foreign intelligence agencies.,And I don't want to livenin that kind of world. 
 And so right now,nyou probably have the tools,to thwart many kindsnof government surveillance,already on your phonesnand already in your pockets,,you just might not realize how strongnand how secure those tools are,,or how weak the other waysnyou've used to communicate really are. 
 And so, my message to you is this:,We need to use these tools.,We need to secure our telephone calls.,We need to secure our text messages.,I want you to use these tools.,I want you to tell your loved ones,nI want you to tell your colleagues:,Use these encrypted communications tools.,Don't just use themnbecause they're cheap and easy,,but use them because they're secure. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It would be nice to benobjective in life,,in many ways.,The problem is that we haventhese color-tinted glasses,as we look at all kinds of situations.,For example, think aboutnsomething as simple as beer.,If I gave you a few beers to taste,and I asked you to rate themnon intensity and bitterness,,different beers would occupyndifferent space.,But what if we triednto be objective about it?,In the case of beer,nit would be very simple.,What if we did a blind taste?,Well, if we did the same thing,nyou tasted the same beer,,now in the blind taste,nthings would look slightly different.,Most of the beers will go into one place.,You will basically notnbe able to distinguish them,,and the exception, of course,nwill be Guinness.,(Laughter) 
 Similarly, we can think about physiology.,What happens when people expectnsomething from their physiology?,For example, we sold peoplenpain medications.,Some people, we told themnthe medications were expensive.,Some people, we told them it was cheap.,And the expensivenpain medication worked better.,It relieved more pain from people,,because expectationsndo change our physiology.,And of course, we all know that in sports,,if you are a fan of a particular team,,you can't help but see the game,develop from the perspective of your team. 
 So all of those are cases in whichnour preconceived notions,and our expectations color our world.,But what happenednin more important questions?,What happened with questionsnthat had to do with social justice?,So we wanted to think aboutnwhat is the blind tasting version,for thinking about inequality?,So we started looking at inequality,,and we did some large-scale surveys,around the U.S. and other countries.,So we asked two questions:,Do people know what kind ofnlevel of inequality we have?,And then, what level of inequalityndo we want to have?,So let's think about the first question.,Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.,and I sorted them fromnthe poorest on the right,to the richest on the left,,and then I divided them into five buckets:,the poorest 20 percent,nthe next 20 percent,,the next, the next,nand the richest 20 percent.,And then I asked you to tell menhow much wealth do you think,is concentrated in each of those buckets.,So to make it simpler,nimagine I ask you to tell me,,how much wealth do you thinknis concentrated,in the bottom two buckets,,the bottom 40 percent?,Take a second. Think about itnand have a number.,Usually we don't think.,Think for a second,nhave a real number in your mind.,You have it? 
 Okay, here's what lotsnof Americans tell us.,They think that the bottom 20 percent,has about 2.9 percent of the wealth,,the next group has 6.4,,so together it's slightly more than nine.,The next group, they say, has 12 percent,,20 percent,,and the richest 20 percent, people thinknhas 58 percent of the wealth.,You can see how this relatesnto what you thought. 
 Now, what's reality?,Reality is slightly different.,The bottom 20 percentnhas 0.1 percent of the wealth.,The next 20 percentnhas 0.2 percent of the wealth.,Together, it's 0.3.,The next group has 3.9,,11.3,,and the richest groupnhas 84-85 percent of the wealth.,So what we actually havenand what we think we have,are very different. 
 What about what we want?,How do we even figure this out?,So to look at this,,to look at what we really want,,we thought aboutnthe philosopher John Rawls.,If you remember John Rawls,,he had this notionnof what's a just society.,He said a just society,is a society that ifnyou knew everything about it,,you would be willingnto enter it in a random place.,And it's a beautiful definition,,because if you're wealthy,nyou might want the wealthy,to have more money, the poor to have less.,If you're poor, you mightnwant more equality.,But if you're goingnto go into that society,in every possible situation,nand you don't know,,you have to consider all the aspects.,It's a little bit like blind tastingnin which you don't know,what the outcome will benwhen you make a decision,,and Rawls called thisnthe "veil of ignorance." 
 So, we took another group,na large group of Americans,,and we asked them the questionnin the veil of ignorance.,What are the characteristics of a countrynthat would make you want to join it,,knowing that you could endnrandomly at any place?,And here is what we got.,What did people want to givento the first group,,the bottom 20 percent?,They wanted to give themnabout 10 percent of the wealth.,The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,,21, 22 and 32. 
 Now, nobody in our samplenwanted full equality.,Nobody thought that socialismnis a fantastic idea in our sample.,But what does it mean?,It means that we have this knowledge gap,between what we havenand what we think we have,,but we have at least as big a gapnbetween what we think is right,to what we think we have. 
 Now, we can ask these questions,nby the way, not just about wealth.,We can ask it about other things as well.,So for example, we asked peoplenfrom different parts of the world,about this question,,people who are liberals and conservatives,,and they gave us basically nthe same answer.,We asked rich and poor,nthey gave us the same answer,,men and women,,NPR listeners and Forbes readers.,We asked people in England,nAustralia, the U.S. --,very similar answers.,We even asked differentndepartments of a university.,We went to Harvard and we checkednalmost every department,,and in fact, from Harvard Business School,,where a few people wanted the wealthynto have more and the [poor] to have less,,the similarity was astonishing.,I know some of you wentnto Harvard Business School. 
 We also asked this questionnabout something else.,We asked, what about the rationof CEO pay to unskilled workers?,So you can see whatnpeople think is the ratio,,and then we can ask the question,nwhat do they think should be the ratio?,And then we can ask, what is reality?,What is reality? And you could say,nwell, it's not that bad, right?,The red and the yellownare not that different.,But the fact is, it's becausenI didn't draw them on the same scale.,It's hard to see, there's yellownand blue in there. 
 So what about other outcomes of wealth?,Wealth is not just about wealth.,We asked, what about things like health?,What about availabilitynof prescription medication?,What about life expectancy?,What about life expectancy of infants?,How do we want this to be distributed?,What about education for young people?,And for older people?,And across all of those things,nwhat we learned was that people,don't like inequality of wealth,,but there's other things where inequality,nwhich is an outcome of wealth,,is even more aversive to them:,for example, inequalitynin health or education.,We also learned that peoplenare particularly open,to changes in equalitynwhen it comes to people,who have less agency --,basically, young kids and babies,,because we don't think of themnas responsible for their situation. 
 So what are some lessons from this?,We have two gaps:,We have a knowledge gapnand we have a desirability gap,And the knowledge gapnis something that we think about,,how do we educate people?,How do we get people to thinkndifferently about inequality,and the consequences of inequalitynin terms of health, education,,jealousy, crime rate, and so on? 
 Then we have the desirability gap.,How do we get people to think differentlynabout what we really want?,You see, the Rawls definition,nthe Rawls way of looking at the world,,the blind tasting approach,,takes our selfish motivationnout of the picture.,How do we implement thatnto a higher degree,on a more extensive scale? 
 And finally, we also have an action gap.,How do we take these thingsnand actually do something about it?,I think part of the answernis to think about people,like young kids and babiesnthat don't have much agency,,because people seem to benmore willing to do this. 
 To summarize, I would say,nnext time you go to drink beer or wine,,first of all, think about, what is itnin your experience that is real,,and what is it in your experiencenthat is a placebo effect,coming from expectations?,And then think about what it also meansnfor other decisions in your life,,and hopefully also for policy questions,that affect all of us. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Applause)(Clicking),I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,,retinal cancer.,My right eye was removed,at seven months of age.,I was 13 monthsnwhen they removed my left eye.,The first thing I didnupon awakening from that last surgery,was to climb out of my crib,and begin wandering aroundnthe intensive care nursery,,probably looking for the onenwho did this to me.,(Laughter),Evidently, wandering around the nursery,was not a problem for me without eyes.,The problem was getting caught. 
 It's impressions about blindness,that are far more threatening,to blind people than the blindness itself.,Think for a moment aboutnyour own impressions of blindness.,Think about your reactionsnwhen I first came onto the stage,,or the prospect of your own blindness,,or a loved one going blind.,The terror is incomprehensiblento most of us,,because blindness,is thought to epitomize ignorancenand unawareness,,hapless exposure to the ravagesnof the dark unknown.,How poetic. 
 Fortunately for me,nmy parents were not poetic.,They were pragmatic.,They understood that ignorance and fearnwere but matters of the mind,,and the mind is adaptable.,They believed that I should grow up,to enjoy the same freedomsnand responsibilities as everyone else.,In their own words, I would move out --,which I did when I was 18 --,I will pay taxes --,thanks --n(Laughter) --,and they knew the differencenbetween love and fear.,Fear immobilizes usnin the face of challenge.,They knew that blindnessnwould pose a significant challenge.,I was not raised with fear.,They put my freedom first before all else,,because that is what love does. 
 Now, moving forward,nhow do I manage today?,The world is a much larger nursery.,Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,,longer than the canesnused by most blind people.,I call it my freedom staff.,It will keep me, for example,,from making an undignified ndeparture from the stage. (Laughter),I do see that cliff edge.,They warned us earliernthat every imaginable mishap,has occurred to speakersnup here on the stage.,I don't care to set a new precedent. 
 But beyond that,,many of you may have heard me clickingnas I came onto the stage --,(Clicking) --,with my tongue.,Those are flashes of sound,that go out and reflectnfrom surfaces all around me,,just like a bat's sonar,,and return to me with patterns, nwith pieces of information,,much as light does for you.,And my brain, thanks to my parents,,has been activated to form imagesnin my visual cortex,,which we now call the imaging system,,from those patterns of information,nmuch as your brain does.,I call this process flash sonar.,It is how I have learned to seenthrough my blindness,,to navigate my journey,through the dark unknownsnof my own challenges,,which has earned me the moniker,"the remarkable Batman." 
 Now, Batman I will accept.,Bats are cool. Batman is cool.,But I was not raised to think of myselfnas in any way remarkable.,I have always regarded myselfnmuch like anyone else,who navigates the dark unknownsnof their own challenges.,Is that so remarkable?,I do not use my eyes, I use my brain. 
 Now, someone, somewhere,,must think that's remarkable,nor I wouldn't be up here,,but let's consider this for a moment.,Everyone out there,who faces or who has evernfaced a challenge,,raise your hands.,Whoosh. Okay.,Lots of hands going up, a moment,nlet me do a head count.,(Clicking),This will take a while.n(Clicking) (Laughter),Okay, lots of hands in the air.,Keep them up. I have an idea.,Those of you who use your brainsnto navigate these challenges,,put your hands down.,Okay, anyone with your hands still up,has challenges of your own. (Laughter) 
 So we all face challenges,,and we all face the dark unknown,,which is endemic to most challenges,nwhich is what most of us fear, okay?,But we all have brains,that allow us, that activate to allow us,to navigate the journeynthrough these challenges. Okay? 
 Case in point: I came up here,and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me,where the lectern was.,So you can't trust those TED folks.,"Find it yourself," they said.,So -- (Laughter),And the feedback for the P.A. systemnis no help at all. 
 So now I present to you a challenge.,So if you'd all close your eyesnfor just a moment, okay?,And you're going to learnna bit of flash sonar.,I'm going to make a sound.,I'm going to hold this panel in front nof me, but I'm not going to move it.,Just listen to the sound for a moment.,Shhhhhhhhhh.,Okay, nothing very interesting.,Now, listen to what happensnto that same exact sound,when I move the panel.,Shhhhhhhhhhh. n(Pitch getting higher and lower),You do not know the powernof the dark side.,(Laughter),I couldn't resist. 
 Okay, now keep your eyes closed,because, did you hear the difference?,Okay. Now, let's be sure.,For your challenge,,you tell me, just say "now"nwhen you hear the panel start to move.,Okay? We'll relax into this. 
 Shhhhhhh. 
 Audience: Now.nDaniel Kish: Good. Excellent.,Open your eyes.,All right. So just a few centimeters,,you would notice the difference.,You've experienced sonar.,You'd all make great blind people.n(Laughter),Let's have a look at what can happen,when this activation process,is given some time and attention. 
 (Video) Juan Ruiz: It's likenyou guys can see with your eyes,and we can see with our ears. 
 Brian Bushway: It's not a matternof enjoying it more or less,,it's about enjoying it differently. 
 Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.nDK: Yeah. 
 SM: And then it's graduallyncoming back down again. 
 DK: Yes!nSM: That's amazing.,I can, like, see the car. Holy mother! 
 J. Louchart: I love being blind.,If I had the opportunity, honestly,nI wouldn't go back to being sighted. 
 JR: The bigger the goal,nthe more obstacles you'll face,,and on the other side of that goal,is victory.,[In Italian],(Applause) 
 DK: Now, do these people look terrified?,Not so much.,We have delivered activation training,to tens of thousands of blindnand sighted people from all backgrounds,in nearly 40 countries.,When blind people learn to see,,sighted people seem inspired,to want to learn to see their waynbetter, more clearly, with less fear,,because this exemplifiesnthe immense capacity within us all,to navigate any type of challenge,nthrough any form of darkness,,to discoveries unimagined,when we are activated. 
 I wish you all a most activating journey. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.,As I know you can see, it'sna spectacular standing ovation at TED.,Thank you for an extraordinary talk.,Just one more question about your world,nyour inner world that you construct.,We think that we have things in our worldnthat you as a blind person don't have,,but what's your world like?,What do you have that we don't have? 
 DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,,so my sonar works about as wellnbehind me as it does in front of me.,It works around corners.,It works through surfaces.,Generally, it's kind of a fuzzynthree-dimensional geometry.,One of my students, who has nownbecome an instructor,,when he lost his vision,nafter a few months,he was sitting in his three story house,and he realized that he could hearneverything going on throughout the house:,conversations, people in the kitchen,npeople in the bathroom,,several floors away, several walls away.,He said it was somethingnlike having x-ray vision. 
 CA: What do you picturenthat you're in right now?,How do you picture this theater? 
 DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.,It's interesting. nWhen people make a sound,,when they laugh, when they fidget,nwhen they take a drink or blow their nose,or whatever, I hear everything.,I hear every little movementnthat every single person makes.,None of it really escapes my attention,,and then, from a sonar perspective,,the size of the room, the curvature nof the audience around the stage,,it's the height of the room.,Like I say, it's all that kind nof three-dimensional surface geometry,all around me. 
 CA: Well, Daniel, you have donena spectacular job,of helping us all see the worldnin a different way.,Thanks so much for that, truly.nDK: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case,that inviting a loved one, a friendnor even a stranger,to record a meaningful interview with you,just might turn out to be one of the most nimportant moments in that person's life,,and in yours. 
 When I was 22 years old,nI was lucky enough to find my calling,when I fell into making radio stories.,At almost the exact same time,,I found out that my dad,nwho I was very, very close to, was gay.,I was taken completely by surprise.,We were a very tight-knit family,,and I was crushed.,At some point, in onenof our strained conversations,,my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.,He told me that one night in 1969,,a group of young blacknand Latino drag queens,fought back against the policenat a gay bar in Manhattan,called the Stonewall Inn,,and how this sparkednthe modern gay rights movement. 
 It was an amazing story,nand it piqued my interest.,So I decided to pick up my tape nrecorder and find out more.,With the help of a young archivistnnamed Michael Shirker,,we tracked down allnof the people we could find,who had been atnthe Stonewall Inn that night.,Recording these interviews,,I saw how the microphonengave me the license,to go places I otherwisennever would have gone,and talk to people I might notnotherwise ever have spoken to.,I had the privilege of getting to know,some of the most amazing,nfierce and courageous human beings,I had ever met.,It was the first timenthe story of Stonewall,had been told to a national audience.,I dedicated the program to my dad,,it changed my relationship with him,nand it changed my life. 
 Over the next 15 years,nI made many more radio documentaries,,working to shine a light on peoplenwho are rarely heard from in the media.,Over and over again,,I'd see how this simple actnof being interviewed,could mean so much to people,,particularly those who had been toldnthat their stories didn't matter.,I could literally seenpeople's back straighten,as they started to speakninto the microphone. 
 In 1998, I made a documentarynabout the last flophouse hotels,on the Bowery in Manhattan.,Guys stayed up in thesencheap hotels for decades.,They lived in cubiclesnthe size of prison cells,covered with chicken wire,so you couldn't jumpnfrom one room into the next.,Later, I wrote a book on the mennwith the photographer Harvey Wang.,I remember walking into a flophousenwith an early version of the book,and showing one of the guys his page.,He stood there staring at it in silence,,then he grabbed the book out of my hand,and started running downnthe long, narrow hallway,holding it over his head,shouting, "I exist! I exist.",(Applause) 
 In many ways, "I exist" becamenthe clarion call for StoryCorps,,this crazy idea that I hadna dozen years ago.,The thought was to takendocumentary work,and turn it on its head.,Traditionally, broadcast documentary,has been about recording interviewsnto create a work of art or entertainment,or education that is seen or heardnby a whole lot of people,,but I wanted to try something,where the interview itselfnwas the purpose of this work,,and see if we could give many,nmany, many people the chance,to be listened to in this way.,So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,,we built a booth where anyone ncan come to honor someone else,by interviewing them about their life.,You come to this booth and you're metnby a facilitator who brings you inside.,You sit across from, say, your grandfather,for close to an hournand you listen and you talk.,Many people think of it as,nif this was to be our last conversation,,what would I want to ask ofnand say to this person,who means so much to me?,At the end of the session,nyou walk away with a copy of the interview,and another copy goesnto the American Folklife Center,at the Library of Congress,so that your great-great-great-grandkidsncan someday get to know your grandfather,through his voice and story. 
 So we open this boothnin one of the busiest places in the world,and invite people to have thisnincredibly intimate conversation,with another human being.,I had no idea if it would work,nbut from the very beginning, it did.,People treated the experiencenwith incredible respect,,and amazing conversations happened inside. 
 I want to play just one animated excerpt,from an interview recordednat that original Grand Central Booth.,This is 12-year-old Joshua Littmanninterviewing his mother, Sarah.,Josh has Asperger's syndrome.,As you may know, kids with Asperger'snare incredibly smart,but have a tough time socially.,They usually have obsessions.,In Josh's case, it's with animals,,so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah,at Grand Central nine years ago. 
 (Video) Josh Littman:nFrom a scale of one to 10,,do you think your life would bendifferent without animals?,Sarah Littman: I think it would benan eight without animals,,because they add so much pleasure to life. 
 JL: How else do you think your lifenwould be different without them? 
 SL: I could do without thingsnlike cockroaches and snakes. 
 JL: Well, I'm okay with snakesnas long as they're not venomous,or constrict you or anything. 
 SL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person -- 
 JL: But cockroach is justnthe insect we love to hate. 
 SL: Yeah, it really is. 
 JL: Have you ever thoughtnyou couldn't cope with having a child? 
 SL: I remember when you were a baby,nyou had really bad colic,,so you would just cry and cry. 
 JL: What's colic?nSL: It's when you get this stomach ache,and all you do is screamnfor, like, four hours. 
 JL: Even louder than Amy does? 
 SL: You were pretty loud,nbut Amy's was more high-pitched. 
 JL: I think it feels like everyonenseems to like Amy more,,like she's the perfect little angel. 
 SL: Well, I can understandnwhy you think that people like Amy more,,and I'm not saying it's becausenof your Asperger's syndrome,,but being friendly comes easily to Amy,,whereas I think for younit's more difficult,,but the people who take the timento get to know you love you so much. 
 JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos?nSL: Yeah -- 
 JL: Like I have better quality friendsnbut less quantity? (Laughter) 
 SL: I wouldn't judgenthe quality, but I think --,JL: I mean, first it was like, Amynloved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,,she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia. 
 SL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.,The important thing for younis that you have a few very good friends,,and really that's what you need in life. 
 JL: Did I turn out to be the sonnyou wanted when I was born?,Did I meet your expectations? 
 SL: You've exceedednmy expectations, sweetie,,because, sure, you have these fantasiesnof what your child's going to be like,,but you have made me grownso much as a parent, because you think -- 
 JL: Well, I was the onenwho made you a parent. 
 SL: You were the one who made me a parent.nThat's a good point. (Laughter),But also because you think differently,from what they tell younin the parenting books,,I really had to learn to thinknoutside of the box with you,,and it's made me much more creativenas a parent and as a person,,and I'll always thank you for that. 
 JL: And that helped when Amy was born? 
 SL: And that helped when Amy was born,nbut you are so incredibly special to me,and I'm so lucky to have you as my son.,(Applause) 
 David Isay: After this storynran on public radio,,Josh received hundreds of letters,telling him what an amazing kid he was.,His mom, Sarah, bound themntogether in a book,,and when Josh got picked on at school,nthey would read the letters together.,I just want to acknowledgenthat two of my heroes,are here with us tonight.,Sarah Littman and her son Josh,nwho is now an honors student in college.,(Applause) 
 You know, a lot of people talk aboutncrying when they hear StoryCorps stories,,and it's not because they're sad.,Most of them aren't.,I think it's because you're hearingnsomething authentic and pure,at this moment,nwhen sometimes it's hard to tell,what's real and what's an advertisement.,It's kind of the anti-reality TV.,Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.,Nobody comes to get famous.,It's simply an act of generosity and love.,So many of these are just everyday people,talking about lives lived with kindness,ncourage, decency and dignity,,and when you hear that kind of story,,it can sometimes feelnlike you're walking on holy ground.,So this experiment nin Grand Central worked, 
 and we expanded across the country.,Today, more than 100,000 peoplenin all 50 states,in thousands of citiesnand towns across America,have recorded StoryCorps interviews.,It's now the largest single collectionnof human voices ever gathered.,(Applause) 
 We've hired and trainednhundreds of facilitators,to help guide peoplenthrough the experience.,Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps,traveling the country,ngathering the wisdom of humanity.,They call it bearing witness,,and if you ask them,,all of the facilitators will tell younthat the most important thing,they've learned from being presentnduring these interviews,is that people are basically good.,And I think for the first yearsnof StoryCorps, you could argue,that there was some kindnof a selection bias happening,,but after tens of thousands of interviewsnwith every kind of person,in every part of the country --,rich, poor, five years old to 105,,80 different languages,nacross the political spectrum --,you have to think that maybe these guysnare actually onto something. 
 I've also learned so muchnfrom these interviews.,I've learned about the poetrynand the wisdom and the grace,that can be found in the wordsnof people all around us,when we simply take the time to listen,,like this interview,between a betting clerk in Brooklynnnamed Danny Perasa,who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorpsnto talk about his love for her. 
 (Audio) Danny Perasa: You see,nthe thing of it is,,I always feel guilty when I sayn"I love you" to you.,And I say it so often.nI say it to remind you,that as dumpy as I am,nit's coming from me.,It's like hearing a beautiful songnfrom a busted old radio,,and it's nice of you to keepnthe radio around the house. 
 Annie Perasa: If I don't have a notenon the kitchen table,,I think there's something wrong.,You write a love letternto me every morning.,DP: Well, the only thingnthat could possibly be wrong,is I couldn't find a silly pen. 
 AP: To my princess:,The weather outside todaynis extremely rainy.,I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning. 
 DP: It's a romantic weather report. 
 AP: And I love you.nI love you. I love you. 
 DP: When a guy is happily married,nno matter what happens at work,,no matter what happensnin the rest of the day,,there's a shelter when you get home,,there's a knowledge knowingnthat you can hug somebody,without them throwing you downstairsnand saying, "Get your hands off me.",Being married is like havingna color television set.,You never want to go backnto black and white.,(Laughter) 
 DI: Danny was about five feet tall,with crossed eyesnand one single snaggletooth,,but Danny Perasa hadnmore romance in his little pinky,than all of Hollywood'snleading men put together. 
 What else have I learned?,I've learned about the almostnunimaginable capacity,for the human spirit to forgive.,I've learned about resiliencenand I've learned about strength. 
 Like an interview with Oshea Israelnand Mary Johnson.,When Oshea was a teenager,nhe murdered Mary's only son,,Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.,A dozen years later, Mary went to prison,to meet Oshea and find outnwho this person was,who had taken her son's life.,Slowly and remarkably,nthey became friends,,and when he was finally releasednfrom the penitentiary,,Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary.,This is just a short excerptnof a conversation they had,soon after Oshea was freed. 
 (Video) Mary Johnson: My natural sonnis no longer here.,I didn't see him graduate,nand now you're going to college.,I'll have the opportunitynto see you graduate.,I didn't see him get married.,Hopefully one day, I'll be ablento experience that with you.,Oshea Israel: Just to hear younsay those things and to be,in my life in the mannernin which you are is my motivation.,It motivates me to make surenthat I stay on the right path.,You still believe in me,,and the fact that you can do itndespite how much pain I caused you,,it's amazing. 
 MJ: I know it's not an easy thingnto be able to share our story together,,even with us sitting herenlooking at each other right now.,I know it's not an easy thing,nso I admire that you can do this. 
 OI: I love you, lady.nMJ: I love you too, son.,(Applause) 
 DI: And I've been reminded countless timesnof the courage and goodness of people,,and how the arc of historyntruly does bend towards justice. 
 Like the story of Alexis Martinez,nwho was born Arthur Martinez,in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.,In the interview, she talksnwith her daughter Lesley,about joining a gang as a young man,,and later in life transitioningninto the woman she was always meant to be.,This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley. 
 (Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the mostndifficult things for me was,I was always afraid thatnI wouldn't be allowed,to be in my granddaughters' lives,,and you blew that completelynout of the water,,you and your husband.,One of the fruits of that is,nin my relationship with my granddaughters,,they fight with each other sometimesnover whether I'm he or she. 
 Lesley Martinez: But they're freento talk about it. 
 AM: They're free to talk about it,nbut that, to me, is a miracle. 
 LM: You don't have to apologize.nYou don't have to tiptoe.,We're not going to cut you off,nand that's something I've always,wanted you to just know,nthat you're loved. 
 AM: You know, I live this every day now.,I walk down the streets as a woman,nand I really am at peace with who I am.,I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,,but now I walk in lovenand I try to live that way every day. 
 DI: Now I walk in love. 
 I'm going to tell youna secret about StoryCorps.,It takes some couragento have these conversations.,StoryCorps speaks to our mortality.,Participants know this recordingnwill be heard long after they're gone.,There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock,who has worked closely with usnon recording interviews,with people who are dying.,He wrote a book calledn"The Four Things That Matter Most",about the four things you want to saynto the most important people in your life,before they or you die:,thank you, I love you,,forgive me, I forgive you.,They're just about the most powerful wordsnwe can say to one another,,and often that's what happensnin a StoryCorps booth.,It's a chance to have a sense of closurenwith someone you care about --,no regrets, nothing left unsaid.,And it's hard and it takes courage,,but that's why we're alive, right? 
 So, the TED Prize.,When I first heard from TEDnand Chris a few months ago,about the possibility of the Prize,nI was completely floored.,They asked me to come upnwith a very brief wish for humanity,,no more than 50 words.,So I thought about it,nI wrote my 50 words,,and a few weeks later,nChris called and said, "Go for it." 
 So here is my wish:,that you will help us,take everything we've learnednthrough StoryCorps,and bring it to the world,so that anyone anywherencan easily record a meaningful interview,with another human beingnwhich will then be archived for history. 
 How are we going to do that? With this.,We're fast moving into a futurenwhere everyone in the world,will have access to one of these,,and it has powers I neverncould have imagined 11 years ago,when I started StoryCorps.,It has a microphone,,it can tell you how to do things,,and it can send audio files.,Those are the key ingredients. 
 So the first part of the wishnis already underway.,Over the past couple of months,,the team at StoryCorpsnhas been working furiously,to create an app that will bringnStoryCorps out of our booths,so that it can be experiencednby anyone, anywhere, anytime.,Remember, StoryCorps has alwaysnbeen two people and a facilitator,helping them record their conversation,nwhich is preserved forever,,but at this very moment,,we're releasing a public beta versionnof the StoryCorps app.,The app is a digital facilitatornthat walks you through,the StoryCorps interview process,,helps you pick questions,,and gives you all the tips you need,to record a meaningfulnStoryCorps interview,,and then with one tap upload it nto our archive at the Library of Congress. 
 That's the easy part, the technology.,The real challenge is up to you:,to take this tool and figure outnhow we can use it,all across America and around the world,,so that instead of recordingnthousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,,we could potentially recordntens of thousands,or hundreds of thousands,or maybe even more. 
 Imagine, for example,na national homework assignment,where every high school studentnstudying U.S. history across the country,records an interviewnwith an elder over Thanksgiving,,so that in one single weekend,an entire generation of American livesnand experiences are captured.,(Applause),Or imagine mothers on oppositensides of a conflict somewhere in the world,sitting down not to talknabout that conflict,but to find out who they are as people,,and in doing so,nbegin to build bonds of trust;,or that someday it becomesna tradition all over the world,that people are honorednwith a StoryCorps interview,on their 75th birthday;,or that people in your community,go into retirement homes or hospitalsnor homeless shelters or even prisons,armed with this app to honor the peoplenleast heard in our society,and ask them who they are,nwhat they've learned in life,,and how they want to be remembered.,(Applause) 
 Ten years ago, I recordedna StoryCorps interview with my dad,who was a psychiatrist,nand became a well-known gay activist.,This is the picturenof us at that interview.,I never thought about that recordingnuntil a couple of years ago,,when my dad, who seemednto be in perfect health,and was still seeing patientsn40 hours a week,,was diagnosed with cancer.,He passed away very suddenlyna few days later.,It was June 28, 2012,,the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. 
 I listened to that interviewnfor the first time at three in the morning,on the day that he died.,I have a couple of young kids at home,,and I knew that the only waynthey were going to get to know this person,who was such a towering figure in my lifenwould be through that session.,I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorpsnany more deeply than I did,,but it was at that moment,that I fully and viscerally graspednthe importance of making these recordings. 
 Every day, people come up to me,and say, "I wish I had interviewednmy father or my grandmother or my brother,,but I waited too long.",Now, no one has to wait anymore.,At this moment,,when so much of how we communicatenis fleeting and inconsequential,,join us in creating this digital archive,of conversations that arenenduring and important.,Help us create this gift to our children,,this testament to whonwe are as human beings.,I hope you'll help us makenthis wish come true.,Interview a family member, a friendnor even a stranger.,Together, we can create an archivenof the wisdom of humanity,,and maybe in doing so,,we'll learn to listen a little morenand shout a little less.,Maybe these conversations will remind usnwhat's really important.,And maybe, just maybe,,it will help us recognizenthat simple truth,that every life, every single life,,matters equally and infinitely.,Thank you very much.,(Applause),Thank you. Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause)We are built out of very small stuff,,and we are embedded inna very large cosmos,,and the fact is that we are notnvery good at understanding reality,at either of those scales,,and that's because our brains,haven't evolved to understand nthe world at that scale. 
 Instead, we're trapped on thisnvery thin slice of perception,right in the middle.,But it gets strange, because even at nthat slice of reality that we call home,,we're not seeing mostnof the action that's going on.,So take the colors of our world.,This is light waves, electromagneticnradiation that bounces off objects,and it hits specialized receptorsnin the back of our eyes.,But we're not seeingnall the waves out there.,In fact, what we see,is less than a 10 trillionthnof what's out there.,So you have radio waves and microwaves,and X-rays and gamma raysnpassing through your body right now,and you're completely unaware of it,,because you don't come withnthe proper biological receptors,for picking it up.,There are thousandsnof cell phone conversations,passing through you right now,,and you're utterly blind to it. 
 Now, it's not that these thingsnare inherently unseeable.,Snakes include some infrarednin their reality,,and honeybees include ultravioletnin their view of the world,,and of course we build machinesnin the dashboards of our cars,to pick up on signalsnin the radio frequency range,,and we built machines in hospitalsnto pick up on the X-ray range.,But you can't sensenany of those by yourself,,at least not yet,,because you don't come equippednwith the proper sensors. 
 Now, what this means is thatnour experience of reality,is constrained by our biology,,and that goes againstnthe common sense notion,that our eyes and our earsnand our fingertips,are just picking upnthe objective reality that's out there.,Instead, our brains are samplingnjust a little bit of the world. 
 Now, across the animal kingdom,,different animals pick upnon different parts of reality.,So in the blindnand deaf world of the tick,,the important signalsnare temperature and butyric acid;,in the world of the black ghost knifefish,,its sensory world is lavishly colorednby electrical fields;,and for the echolocating bat,,its reality is constructednout of air compression waves.,That's the slice of their ecosystemnthat they can pick up on,,and we have a word for this in science.,It's called the umwelt,,which is the German wordnfor the surrounding world.,Now, presumably, every animal assumes,that its umwelt is the entirenobjective reality out there,,because why would you ever stop to imagine,that there's something beyondnwhat we can sense.,Instead, what we all donis we accept reality,as it's presented to us. 
 Let's do a consciousness-raiser on this.,Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog.,Your whole world is about smelling.,You've got a long snout that hasn200 million scent receptors in it,,and you have wet nostrilsnthat attract and trap scent molecules,,and your nostrils even have slitsnso you can take big nosefuls of air.,Everything is about smell for you.,So one day, you stop in your tracksnwith a revelation.,You look at your human ownernand you think,,"What is it like to have the pitiful,nimpoverished nose of a human?,(Laughter),What is it like when you takena feeble little noseful of air?,How can you not know that there'sna cat 100 yards away,,or that your neighbor was onnthis very spot six hours ago?",(Laughter) 
 So because we're humans,,we've never experiencednthat world of smell,,so we don't miss it,,because we are firmly settledninto our umwelt.,But the question is,ndo we have to be stuck there?,So as a neuroscientist, I'm interestednin the way that technology,might expand our umwelt,,and how that's going to changenthe experience of being human. 
 So we already know that we can marrynour technology to our biology,,because there are hundreds of thousandsnof people walking around,with artificial hearingnand artificial vision.,So the way this works is, you takena microphone and you digitize the signal,,and you put an electrode stripndirectly into the inner ear.,Or, with the retinal implant,nyou take a camera,and you digitize the signal,nand then you plug an electrode grid,directly into the optic nerve.,And as recently as 15 years ago,,there were a lot of scientists who thoughtnthese technologies wouldn't work.,Why? It's because these technologiesnspeak the language of Silicon Valley,,and it's not exactly the same dialectnas our natural biological sense organs.,But the fact is that it works;,the brain figures outnhow to use the signals just fine. 
 Now, how do we understand that?,Well, here's the big secret:,Your brain is not hearingnor seeing any of this.,Your brain is locked in a vault of silencenand darkness inside your skull.,All it ever sees arenelectrochemical signals,that come in along different data cables,,and this is all it has to work with,nand nothing more.,Now, amazingly,,the brain is really goodnat taking in these signals,and extracting patternsnand assigning meaning,,so that it takes this inner cosmosnand puts together a story,of this, your subjective world. 
 But here's the key point:,Your brain doesn't know,nand it doesn't care,,where it gets the data from.,Whatever information comes in,nit just figures out what to do with it.,And this is a very efficientnkind of machine.,It's essentially a general purposencomputing device,,and it just takes in everything,and figures outnwhat it's going to do with it,,and that, I think, frees up Mother Nature,to tinker around with differentnsorts of input channels. 
 So I call this the P.H. nmodel of evolution,,and I don't want to getntoo technical here,,but P.H. stands for Potato Head,,and I use this name to emphasizenthat all these sensors,that we know and love, like our eyesnand our ears and our fingertips,,these are merely peripheralnplug-and-play devices:,You stick them in, and you're good to go.,The brain figures out what to donwith the data that comes in.,And when you look acrossnthe animal kingdom,,you find lots of peripheral devices.,So snakes have heat pitsnwith which to detect infrared,,and the ghost knifefish hasnelectroreceptors,,and the star-nosed mole has this appendage,with 22 fingers on it,with which it feels around and constructsna 3D model of the world,,and many birds have magnetitenso they can orient,to the magnetic field of the planet.,So what this means is thatnnature doesn't have to continually,redesign the brain.,Instead, with the principlesnof brain operation established,,all nature has to worry aboutnis designing new peripherals. 
 Okay. So what this means is this:,The lesson that surfaces,is that there's nothingnreally special or fundamental,about the biology that wencome to the table with.,It's just what we have inherited,from a complex road of evolution.,But it's not what we have to stick with,,and our best proof of principle of this,comes from what's callednsensory substitution.,And that refers to feedingninformation into the brain,via unusual sensory channels,,and the brain just figures outnwhat to do with it. 
 Now, that might sound speculative,,but the first paper demonstrating this wasnpublished in the journal Nature in 1969.,So a scientist named Paul Bach-y-Rita,put blind peoplenin a modified dental chair,,and he set up a video feed,,and he put somethingnin front of the camera,,and then you would feel that,poked into your backnwith a grid of solenoids.,So if you wiggle a coffee cupnin front of the camera,,you're feeling that in your back,,and amazingly, blind peoplengot pretty good,at being able to determinenwhat was in front of the camera,just by feeling itnin the small of their back.,Now, there have been manynmodern incarnations of this.,The sonic glasses take a video feednright in front of you,and turn that into a sonic landscape,,so as things move around,nand get closer and farther,,it sounds like "Bzz, bzz, bzz.",It sounds like a cacophony,,but after several weeks, blind peoplenstart getting pretty good,at understanding what's in front of them,just based on what they're hearing.,And it doesn't have to benthrough the ears:,this system uses an electrotactile gridnon the forehead,,so whatever's in front of the video feed,nyou're feeling it on your forehead.,Why the forehead? Because you're notnusing it for much else. 
 The most modern incarnationnis called the brainport,,and this is a little electrogridnthat sits on your tongue,,and the video feed gets turned intonthese little electrotactile signals,,and blind people get so good at using thisnthat they can throw a ball into a basket,,or they can navigatencomplex obstacle courses.,They can come to see through their tongue.,Now, that sounds completely insane, right?,But remember, all vision ever is,is electrochemical signalsncoursing around in your brain.,Your brain doesn't knownwhere the signals come from.,It just figures out what to do with them. 
 So my interest in my labnis sensory substitution for the deaf,,and this is a project I've undertaken,with a graduate studentnin my lab, Scott Novich,,who is spearheading this for his thesis.,And here is what we wanted to do:,we wanted to make it so thatnsound from the world gets converted,in some way so that a deaf personncan understand what is being said.,And we wanted to do this, given the powernand ubiquity of portable computing,,we wanted to make sure that thisnwould run on cell phones and tablets,,and also we wantednto make this a wearable,,something that you could wearnunder your clothing.,So here's the concept.,So as I'm speaking, my soundnis getting captured by the tablet,,and then it's getting mapped onto a vestnthat's covered in vibratory motors,,just like the motors in your cell phone.,So as I'm speaking,,the sound is getting translatednto a pattern of vibration on the vest.,Now, this is not just conceptual:,this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth,nand I'm wearing the vest right now.,So as I'm speaking -- (Applause) --,the sound is getting translatedninto dynamic patterns of vibration.,I'm feeling the sonic world around me. 
 So, we've been testing thisnwith deaf people now,,and it turns out that afternjust a little bit of time,,people can start feeling,nthey can start understanding,the language of the vest. 
 So this is Jonathan. He's 37 years old.nHe has a master's degree.,He was born profoundly deaf,,which means that there's a partnof his umwelt that's unavailable to him.,So we had Jonathan train with the vestnfor four days, two hours a day,,and here he is on the fifth day. 
 Scott Novich: You. 
 David Eagleman: So Scott says a word,nJonathan feels it on the vest,,and he writes it on the board. 
 SN: Where. Where. 
 DE: Jonathan is able to translatenthis complicated pattern of vibrations,into an understandingnof what's being said. 
 SN: Touch. Touch. 
 DE: Now, he's not doing this --,(Applause) --,Jonathan is not doing this consciously,nbecause the patterns are too complicated,,but his brain is starting to unlocknthe pattern that allows it to figure out,what the data mean,,and our expectation is that,nafter wearing this for about three months,,he will have a directnperceptual experience of hearing,in the same way that when a blind personnpasses a finger over braille,,the meaning comes directly off the pagenwithout any conscious intervention at all.,Now, this technology has the potentialnto be a game-changer,,because the only other solutionnfor deafness is a cochlear implant,,and that requires an invasive surgery.,And this can be built for 40 times cheapernthan a cochlear implant,,which opens up this technology globally,neven for the poorest countries. 
 Now, we've been very encouragednby our results with sensory substitution,,but what we've been thinking a lot aboutnis sensory addition.,How could we use a technology like thisnto add a completely new kind of sense,,to expand the human umvelt?,For example, could we feednreal-time data from the Internet,directly into somebody's brain,,and can they develop a directnperceptual experience? 
 So here's an experimentnwe're doing in the lab.,A subject is feeling a real-timenstreaming feed from the Net of data,for five seconds.,Then, two buttons appear,nand he has to make a choice.,He doesn't know what's going on.,He makes a choice,nand he gets feedback after one second.,Now, here's the thing:,The subject has no ideanwhat all the patterns mean,,but we're seeing if he gets betternat figuring out which button to press.,He doesn't know that what we're feeding,is real-time data from the stock market,,and he's making buy and sell decisions.,(Laughter),And the feedback is telling himnwhether he did the right thing or not.,And what we're seeing is,ncan we expand the human umvelt,so that he comes to have,nafter several weeks,,a direct perceptual experiencenof the economic movements of the planet.,So we'll report on that laternto see how well this goes.,(Laughter) 
 Here's another thing we're doing:,During the talks this morning,nwe've been automatically scraping Twitter,for the TED2015 hashtag,,and we've been doingnan automated sentiment analysis,,which means, are people using positivenwords or negative words or neutral?,And while this has been going on,,I have been feeling this,,and so I am plugged innto the aggregate emotion,of thousands of people in real time,,and that's a new kind of human experience,nbecause now I can know,how everyone's doingnand how much you're loving this.,(Laughter) (Applause),It's a bigger experiencenthan a human can normally have. 
 We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots.,So in this case, the vest is streamingnnine different measures,from this quadcopter,,so pitch and yaw and rollnand orientation and heading,,and that improvesnthis pilot's ability to fly it.,It's essentially like he's extendingnhis skin up there, far away. 
 And that's just the beginning.,What we're envisioning is takingna modern cockpit full of gauges,and instead of tryingnto read the whole thing, you feel it.,We live in a world of information now,,and there is a differencenbetween accessing big data,and experiencing it. 
 So I think there's really no endnto the possibilities,on the horizon for human expansion.,Just imagine an astronautnbeing able to feel,the overall healthnof the International Space Station,,or, for that matter, having you feelnthe invisible states of your own health,,like your blood sugarnand the state of your microbiome,,or having 360-degree visionnor seeing in infrared or ultraviolet. 
 So the key is this:nAs we move into the future,,we're going to increasingly be ablento choose our own peripheral devices.,We no longer have to waitnfor Mother Nature's sensory gifts,on her timescales,,but instead, like any good parent,nshe's given us the tools that we need,to go out and define our own trajectory.,So the question now is,,how do you want to go outnand experience your universe? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Can you feel it?nDE: Yeah. 
 Actually, this was the first timenI felt applause on the vest.,It's nice. It's like a massage. (Laughter) 
 CA: Twitter's going crazy.nTwitter's going mad.,So that stock market experiment.,This could be the first experimentnthat secures its funding forevermore,,right, if successful? 
 DE: Well, that's right, I wouldn'tnhave to write to NIH anymore. 
 CA: Well look, just to benskeptical for a minute,,I mean, this is amazing,nbut isn't most of the evidence so far,that sensory substitution works,,not necessarily nthat sensory addition works?,I mean, isn't it possible that thenblind person can see through their tongue,because the visual cortex is still there,nready to process,,and that that is needed as part of it? 
 DE: That's a great question.nWe actually have no idea,what the theoretical limits are of whatnkind of data the brain can take in.,The general story, though,nis that it's extraordinarily flexible.,So when a person goes blind,nwhat we used to call their visual cortex,gets taken over by other things,nby touch, by hearing, by vocabulary.,So what that tells us is thatnthe cortex is kind of a one-trick pony.,It just runs certain kindsnof computations on things.,And when we look aroundnat things like braille, for example,,people are getting informationnthrough bumps on their fingers.,So I don't think we have any reasonnto think there's a theoretical limit,that we know the edge of. 
 CA: If this checks out,nyou're going to be deluged.,There are so manynpossible applications for this.,Are you ready for this? What are you mostnexcited about, the direction it might go?,DE: I mean, I think there'sna lot of applications here.,In terms of beyond sensory substitution,nthe things I started mentioning,about astronauts on the space station,nthey spend a lot of their time,monitoring things, and they could insteadnjust get what's going on,,because what this is really good fornis multidimensional data.,The key is this: Our visual systemsnare good at detecting blobs and edges,,but they're really badnat what our world has become,,which is screensnwith lots and lots of data.,We have to crawl thatnwith our attentional systems.,So this is a way of justnfeeling the state of something,,just like the way you know the statenof your body as you're standing around.,So I think heavy machinery, safety,nfeeling the state of a factory,,of your equipment, that's one placenit'll go right away. 
 CA: David Eagleman, that was onenmind-blowing talk. Thank you very much. 
 DE: Thank you, Chris.n(Applause)Let me show you something. 
 (Video) Girl: Okay, that's a catnsitting in a bed.,The boy is petting the elephant.,Those are peoplenthat are going on an airplane.,That's a big airplane. 
 Fei-Fei Li: This isna three-year-old child,describing what she seesnin a series of photos.,She might still have a lotnto learn about this world,,but she's already an expertnat one very important task:,to make sense of what she sees.,Our society is morentechnologically advanced than ever.,We send people to the moon,nwe make phones that talk to us,or customize radio stationsnthat can play only music we like.,Yet, our most advancednmachines and computers,still struggle at this task.,So I'm here todaynto give you a progress report,on the latest advancesnin our research in computer vision,,one of the most frontiernand potentially revolutionary,technologies in computer science. 
 Yes, we have prototyped carsnthat can drive by themselves,,but without smart vision,nthey cannot really tell the difference,between a crumpled paper bagnon the road, which can be run over,,and a rock that size,nwhich should be avoided.,We have made fabulous megapixel cameras,,but we have not deliverednsight to the blind.,Drones can fly over massive land,,but don't have enough vision technology,to help us to tracknthe changes of the rainforests.,Security cameras are everywhere,,but they do not alert us when a childnis drowning in a swimming pool.,Photos and videos are becomingnan integral part of global life.,They're being generated at a pacenthat's far beyond what any human,,or teams of humans, could hope to view,,and you and I are contributingnto that at this TED.,Yet our most advanced softwarenis still struggling at understanding,and managing this enormous content.,So in other words,ncollectively as a society,,we're very much blind,,because our smartest nmachines are still blind. 
 "Why is this so hard?" you may ask.,Cameras can take pictures like this one,by converting lights intona two-dimensional array of numbers,known as pixels,,but these are just lifeless numbers.,They do not carry meaning in themselves.,Just like to hear is notnthe same as to listen,,to take pictures is notnthe same as to see,,and by seeing,nwe really mean understanding.,In fact, it took Mother Naturen540 million years of hard work,to do this task,,and much of that effort,went into developing the visualnprocessing apparatus of our brains,,not the eyes themselves.,So vision begins with the eyes,,but it truly takes place in the brain. 
 So for 15 years now, startingnfrom my Ph.D. at Caltech,and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,,I've been working with my mentors,ncollaborators and students,to teach computers to see.,Our research field is calledncomputer vision and machine learning.,It's part of the general fieldnof artificial intelligence.,So ultimately, we want to teachnthe machines to see just like we do:,naming objects, identifying people,ninferring 3D geometry of things,,understanding relations, emotions,nactions and intentions.,You and I weave together entire storiesnof people, places and things,the moment we lay our gaze on them. 
 The first step towards this goalnis to teach a computer to see objects,,the building block of the visual world.,In its simplest terms,nimagine this teaching process,as showing the computersnsome training images,of a particular object, let's say cats,,and designing a model that learnsnfrom these training images.,How hard can this be?,After all, a cat is justna collection of shapes and colors,,and this is what we didnin the early days of object modeling.,We'd tell the computer algorithmnin a mathematical language,that a cat has a round face,na chubby body,,two pointy ears, and a long tail,,and that looked all fine.,But what about this cat?,(Laughter),It's all curled up.,Now you have to add another shapenand viewpoint to the object model.,But what if cats are hidden?,What about these silly cats?,Now you get my point.,Even something as simplenas a household pet,can present an infinite numbernof variations to the object model,,and that's just one object. 
 So about eight years ago,,a very simple and profound observationnchanged my thinking.,No one tells a child how to see,,especially in the early years.,They learn this throughnreal-world experiences and examples.,If you consider a child's eyes,as a pair of biological cameras,,they take one picturenabout every 200 milliseconds,,the average time an eye movement is made.,So by age three, a child would have seennhundreds of millions of pictures,of the real world.,That's a lot of training examples.,So instead of focusing solelynon better and better algorithms,,my insight was to give the algorithmsnthe kind of training data,that a child was given through experiences,in both quantity and quality. 
 Once we know this,,we knew we needed to collect a data set,that has far more imagesnthan we have ever had before,,perhaps thousands of times more,,and together with ProfessornKai Li at Princeton University,,we launched the ImageNet project in 2007.,Luckily, we didn't have to mountna camera on our head,and wait for many years.,We went to the Internet,,the biggest treasure trove of picturesnthat humans have ever created.,We downloaded nearly a billion images,and used crowdsourcing technologynlike the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform,to help us to label these images.,At its peak, ImageNet was one ofnthe biggest employers,of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:,together, almost 50,000 workers,from 167 countries around the world,helped us to clean, sort and label,nearly a billion candidate images.,That was how much effort it took,to capture even a fractionnof the imagery,a child's mind takes innin the early developmental years. 
 In hindsight, this idea of using big data,to train computer algorithmsnmay seem obvious now,,but back in 2007, it was not so obvious.,We were fairly alone on this journeynfor quite a while.,Some very friendly colleagues advised mento do something more useful for my tenure,,and we were constantly strugglingnfor research funding.,Once, I even joked to my graduate students,that I would just reopennmy dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet.,After all, that's how I fundednmy college years. 
 So we carried on.,In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered,a database of 15 million images,across 22,000 classesnof objects and things,organized by everyday English words.,In both quantity and quality,,this was an unprecedented scale.,As an example, in the case of cats,,we have more than 62,000 cats,of all kinds of looks and poses,and across all speciesnof domestic and wild cats.,We were thrillednto have put together ImageNet,,and we wanted the whole research worldnto benefit from it,,so in the TED fashion,nwe opened up the entire data set,to the worldwidenresearch community for free.,(Applause) 
 Now that we have the datanto nourish our computer brain,,we're ready to come backnto the algorithms themselves.,As it turned out, the wealthnof information provided by ImageNet,was a perfect match to a particular classnof machine learning algorithms,called convolutional neural network,,pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima,nGeoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun,back in the 1970s and '80s.,Just like the brain consistsnof billions of highly connected neurons,,a basic operating unit in a neural network,is a neuron-like node.,It takes input from other nodes,and sends output to others.,Moreover, these hundreds of thousandsnor even millions of nodes,are organized in hierarchical layers,,also similar to the brain.,In a typical neural network we usento train our object recognition model,,it has 24 million nodes,,140 million parameters,,and 15 billion connections.,That's an enormous model.,Powered by the massive data from ImageNet,and the modern CPUs and GPUsnto train such a humongous model,,the convolutional neural network,blossomed in a way that no one expected.,It became the winning architecture,to generate exciting new resultsnin object recognition.,This is a computer telling us,this picture contains a cat,and where the cat is.,Of course there are more things than cats,,so here's a computer algorithm telling us,the picture containsna boy and a teddy bear;,a dog, a person, and a small kitenin the background;,or a picture of very busy things,like a man, a skateboard,nrailings, a lampost, and so on.,Sometimes, when the computernis not so confident about what it sees,,we have taught it to be smart enough,to give us a safe answerninstead of committing too much,,just like we would do,,but other times our computer algorithmnis remarkable at telling us,what exactly the objects are,,like the make, model, year of the cars. 
 We applied this algorithm to millionsnof Google Street View images,across hundreds of American cities,,and we have learned somethingnreally interesting:,first, it confirmed our common wisdom,that car prices correlate very well,with household incomes.,But surprisingly, car pricesnalso correlate well,with crime rates in cities,,or voting patterns by zip codes. 
 So wait a minute. Is that it?,Has the computer already matchednor even surpassed human capabilities?,Not so fast.,So far, we have just taughtnthe computer to see objects.,This is like a small childnlearning to utter a few nouns.,It's an incredible accomplishment,,but it's only the first step.,Soon, another developmentalnmilestone will be hit,,and children beginnto communicate in sentences.,So instead of sayingnthis is a cat in the picture,,you already heard the little girlntelling us this is a cat lying on a bed. 
 So to teach a computernto see a picture and generate sentences,,the marriage between big datanand machine learning algorithm,has to take another step.,Now, the computer has to learnnfrom both pictures,as well as natural language sentences,generated by humans.,Just like the brain integratesnvision and language,,we developed a modelnthat connects parts of visual things,like visual snippets,with words and phrases in sentences. 
 About four months ago,,we finally tied all this together,and produced one of the firstncomputer vision models,that is capable of generatingna human-like sentence,when it sees a picture for the first time.,Now, I'm ready to show younwhat the computer says,when it sees the picture,that the little girl sawnat the beginning of this talk. 
 (Video) Computer: A man is standingnnext to an elephant.,A large airplane sitting on topnof an airport runway. 
 FFL: Of course, we're still working hardnto improve our algorithms,,and it still has a lot to learn.,(Applause) 
 And the computer still makes mistakes. 
 (Video) Computer: A cat lyingnon a bed in a blanket. 
 FFL: So of course, when it seesntoo many cats,,it thinks everythingnmight look like a cat. 
 (Video) Computer: A young boynis holding a baseball bat.,(Laughter) 
 FFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush,nit confuses it with a baseball bat. 
 (Video) Computer: A man riding a horsendown a street next to a building.,(Laughter) 
 FFL: We haven't taught Art 101nto the computers. 
 (Video) Computer: A zebra standingnin a field of grass. 
 FFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciatenthe stunning beauty of nature,like you and I do. 
 So it has been a long journey.,To get from age zero to three was hard.,The real challenge is to gonfrom three to 13 and far beyond.,Let me remind you with this picturenof the boy and the cake again.,So far, we have taughtnthe computer to see objects,or even tell us a simple storynwhen seeing a picture. 
 (Video) Computer: A person sittingnat a table with a cake. 
 FFL: But there's so much more nto this picture,than just a person and a cake.,What the computer doesn't seenis that this is a special Italian cake,that's only served during Easter time.,The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt,given to him as a gift by his fathernafter a trip to Sydney,,and you and I can all tell how happy he is,and what's exactly on his mindnat that moment. 
 This is my son Leo.,On my quest for visual intelligence,,I think of Leo constantly,and the future world he will live in.,When machines can see,,doctors and nurses will havenextra pairs of tireless eyes,to help them to diagnosenand take care of patients.,Cars will run smarternand safer on the road.,Robots, not just humans,,will help us to brave the disaster zonesnto save the trapped and wounded.,We will discover new species, nbetter materials,,and explore unseen frontiersnwith the help of the machines. 
 Little by little, we're giving sightnto the machines.,First, we teach them to see.,Then, they help us to see better.,For the first time, human eyesnwon't be the only ones,pondering and exploring our world.,We will not only use the machinesnfor their intelligence,,we will also collaborate with themnin ways that we cannot even imagine. 
 This is my quest:,to give computers visual intelligence,and to create a better futurenfor Leo and for the world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to take you on the epic questnof the Rosetta spacecraft.,To escort and land the probe on a comet,,this has been my passionnfor the past two years.,In order to do that,,I need to explain to you somethingnabout the origin of the solar system. 
 When we go backnfour and a half billion years,,there was a cloud of gas and dust.,In the center of this cloud,nour sun formed and ignited.,Along with that, what we now knownas planets, comets and asteroids formed.,What then happened, according to theory,,is that when the Earth had cooled downna bit after its formation,,comets massively impacted the Earthnand delivered water to Earth.,They probably also deliveredncomplex organic material to Earth,,and that may have bootstrappednthe emergence of life.,You can compare this to havingnto solve a 250-piece puzzle,and not a 2,000-piece puzzle. 
 Afterwards, the big planetsnlike Jupiter and Saturn,,they were not in their placenwhere they are now,,and they interacted gravitationally,,and they swept the whole interiornof the solar system clean,,and what we now know as comets,ended up in somethingncalled the Kuiper Belt,,which is a belt of objectsnbeyond the orbit of Neptune.,And sometimes these objectsnrun into each other,,and they gravitationally deflect,,and then the gravity of Jupiternpulls them back into the solar system.,And they then become the cometsnas we see them in the sky. 
 The important thing here to notenis that in the meantime,,the four and a half billion years,,these comets have been sittingnon the outside of the solar system,,and haven't changed --,deep, frozen versions of our solar system. 
 In the sky, they look like this.,We know them for their tails.,There are actually two tails.,One is a dust tail,nwhich is blown away by the solar wind.,The other one is an ion tail,nwhich is charged particles,,and they follow the magnetic fieldnin the solar system.,There's the coma,,and then there is the nucleus,nwhich here is too small to see,,and you have to remembernthat in the case of Rosetta,,the spacecraft is in that center pixel.,We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometersnaway from the comet. 
 So what's important to remember?,Comets contain the original materialnfrom which our solar system was formed,,so they're ideal to study the components,that were present at the time nwhen Earth, and life, started.,Comets are also suspected,of having brought the elementsnwhich may have bootstrapped life.,In 1983, ESA set upnits long-term Horizon 2000 program,,which contained one cornerstone,nwhich would be a mission to a comet.,In parallel, a small mission to a comet,nwhat you see here, Giotto, was launched,,and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halleynwith an armada of other spacecraft.,From the results of that mission,nit became immediately clear,that comets were ideal bodies to studynto understand our solar system.,And thus, the Rosetta missionnwas approved in 1993,,and originally it was supposednto be launched in 2003,,but a problem arosenwith an Ariane rocket.,However, our P.R. department,nin its enthusiasm,,had already maden1,000 Delft Blue plates,with the name of the wrong comets.,So I've never had to buy any china since.nThat's the positive part.,(Laughter) 
 Once the whole problem was solved,,we left Earth in 2004,to the newly selected comet,nChuryumov-Gerasimenko.,This comet had to be specially selected,because A, you have tonbe able to get to it,,and B, it shouldn't have beennin the solar system too long.,This particular comet has been nin the solar system since 1959.,That's the first timenwhen it was deflected by Jupiter,,and it got close enoughnto the sun to start changing.,So it's a very fresh comet. 
 Rosetta made a few historic firsts.,It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,,and to escort it throughoutnits whole tour through the solar system --,closest approach to the sun,nas we will see in August,,and then away again to the exterior.,It's the first ever landing on a comet.,We actually orbit the cometnusing something which is not,normally done with spacecraft.,Normally, you look at the sky and you knownwhere you point and where you are.,In this case, that's not enough.,We navigated by lookingnat landmarks on the comet.,We recognized features --nboulders, craters --,and that's how we know where we arenrespective to the comet. 
 And, of course, it's the first satellitento go beyond the orbit of Jupiter,on solar cells.,Now, this sounds more heroicnthan it actually is,,because the technologynto use radio isotope thermal generators,wasn't available in Europe at that time,nso there was no choice.,But these solar arrays are big.,This is one wing, and these are notnspecially selected small people.,They're just like you and me.,(Laughter),We have two of these wings,n65 square meters.,Now later on, of course,nwhen we got to the comet,,you find out that 65 square meters of sail,close to a body which is outgassingnis not always a very handy choice. 
 Now, how did we get to the comet?,Because we had to go therenfor the Rosetta scientific objectives,very far away -- four times the distancenof the Earth to the sun --,and also at a much higher velocitynthan we could achieve with fuel,,because we'd have to take six times asnmuch fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.,So what do you do?,You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,,where you pass by a planetnat very low altitude,,a few thousand kilometers,,and then you get the velocitynof that planet around the sun for free.,We did that a few times.,We did Earth, we did Mars,nwe did twice Earth again,,and we also flew by two asteroids,nLutetia and Steins.,Then in 2011, we got so far from the sunnthat if the spacecraft got into trouble,,we couldn't actuallynsave the spacecraft anymore,,so we went into hibernation.,Everything was switched offnexcept for one clock.,Here you see in white the trajectory,nand the way this works.,You see that fromnthe circle where we started,,the white line, actually you getnmore and more and more elliptical,,and then finally we approached the comet,in May 2014, and we had to startndoing the rendezvous maneuvers. 
 On the way there, we flew by Earth and wentook a few pictures to test our cameras.,This is the moon rising over Earth,,and this is what we now call a selfie,,which at that time, by the way,nthat word didn't exist. (Laughter),It's at Mars. It was takennby the CIVA camera.,That's one of the cameras on the lander,,and it just looks under the solar arrays,,and you see the planet Marsnand the solar array in the distance. 
 Now, when we got outnof hibernation in January 2014,,we started arriving at a distance,of two million kilometersnfrom the comet in May.,However, the velocitynthe spacecraft had was much too fast.,We were going 2,800 kilometers an hournfaster than the comet, so we had to brake.,We had to do eight maneuvers,,and you see here,nsome of them were really big.,We had to brake the first onenby a few hundred kilometers per hour,,and actually, the duration of thatnwas seven hours,,and it used 218 kilos of fuel,,and those were seven nerve-wracking nhours, because in 2007,,there was a leak in the systemnof the propulsion of Rosetta,,and we had to close off a branch,,so the system was actuallynoperating at a pressure,which it was never designednor qualified for. 
 Then we got in the vicinity of the comet,nand these were the first pictures we saw.,The true comet rotation periodnis 12 and a half hours,,so this is accelerated,,but you will understand thatnour flight dynamics engineers thought,,this is not going to benan easy thing to land on.,We had hoped for some kindnof spud-like thing,where you could easily land.,But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.,No. That didn't work either. (Laughter) 
 So at that point in time,nit was clearly unavoidable:,we had to map this bodynin all the detail you could get,,because we had to find an areanwhich is 500 meters in diameter and flat.,Why 500 meters? That's the errornwe have on landing the probe.,So we went through this process,nand we mapped the comet.,We used a techniquencalled photoclinometry.,You use shadows thrown by the sun.,What you see here is a rocknsitting on the surface of the comet,,and the sun shines from above.,From the shadow, we, with our brain,,can immediately determinenroughly what the shape of that rock is.,You can program that in a computer,,you then cover the whole comet,nand you can map the comet.,For that, we flew special trajectoriesnstarting in August.,First, a trianglenof 100 kilometers on a side,at 100 kilometers' distance,,and we repeated the whole nthing at 50 kilometers.,At that time, we had seen the cometnat all kinds of angles,,and we could use this techniquento map the whole thing. 
 Now, this led to a selectionnof landing sites.,This whole process we had to do,nto go from the mapping of the comet,to actually findingnthe final landing site, was 60 days.,We didn't have more.,To give you an idea,nthe average Mars mission,takes hundreds of scientistsnfor years to meet,about where shall we go?,We had 60 days, and that was it. 
 We finally selected the final landing site,and the commands were preparednfor Rosetta to launch Philae.,The way this works is that Rosettanhas to be at the right point in space,,and aiming towards the comet,nbecause the lander is passive.,The lander is then pushed outnand moves towards the comet.,Rosetta had to turn around,to get its cameras to actually looknat Philae while it was departing,and to be able to communicate with it. 
 Now, the landing durationnof the whole trajectory was seven hours.,Now do a simple calculation:,if the velocity of Rosetta is offnby one centimeter per second,,seven hours is 25,000 seconds.,That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.,So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta,much better thannone centimeter per second,,and its location in spacenbetter than 100 meters,at 500 million kilometers from Earth.,That's no mean feat. 
 Let me quickly take you throughnsome of the science and the instruments.,I won't bore you with all the detailsnof all the instruments,,but it's got everything.,We can sniff gas,nwe can measure dust particles,,the shape of them, the composition,,there are magnetometers, everything.,This is one of the results fromnan instrument which measures gas density,at the position of Rosetta,,so it's gas which has left the comet.,The bottom graphnis September of last year.,There is a long-term variation,nwhich in itself is not surprising,,but you see the sharp peaks.,This is a comet day.,You can see the effect of the sunnon the evaporation of gas,and the fact that the comet is rotating.,So there is one spot, apparently,,where there is a lot of stuff coming from,,it gets heated in the Sun,nand then cools down on the back side.,And we can seenthe density variations of this. 
 These are the gasesnand the organic compounds,that we already have measured.,You will see it's an impressive list,,and there is much, much,nmuch more to come,,because there are more measurements.,Actually, there is a conferencengoing on in Houston at the moment,where many of these results are presented. 
 Also, we measured dust particles.,Now, for you, this will notnlook very impressive,,but the scientists were thrillednwhen they saw this.,Two dust particles:,the right one they call Boris,nand they shot it with tantalum,in order to be able to analyze it.,Now, we found sodium and magnesium.,What this tells you is this isnthe concentration of these two materials,at the time the solar system was formed,,so we learned things aboutnwhich materials were there,when the planet was made. 
 Of course, one of the importantnelements is the imaging.,This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,nthe OSIRIS camera,,and this actually was the covernof Science magazine,on January 23 of this year.,Nobody had expectednthis body to look like this.,Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looksnmore like the Half Dome in Yosemite,than anything else.,We also saw things like this:,dunes, and what look to be,non the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.,Now we know these from Mars,nbut this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,,so it's a bit difficult to createna wind-blown shadow.,It may be local outgassing,,stuff which goes up and comes back.,We don't know, so there isna lot to investigate.,Here, you see the same image twice.,On the left-hand side,nyou see in the middle a pit.,On the right-hand side,nif you carefully look,,there are three jets coming outnof the bottom of that pit.,So this is the activity of the comet.,Apparently, at the bottom of these pitsnis where the active regions are,,and where the materialnevaporates into space.,There is a very intriguing cracknin the neck of the comet.,You see it on the right-hand side.,It's a kilometer long,nand it's two and a half meters wide.,Some people suggest that actually,,when we get close to the sun,,the comet may split in two,,and then we'll have to choose,,which comet do we go for?,The lander -- again, lots of instruments,,mostly comparable except for the thingsnwhich hammer in the ground and drill, etc.,But much the same as Rosetta, and that isnbecause you want to compare,what you find in spacenwith what you find on the comet.,These are callednground truth measurements. 
 These are the landing descent images,that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.,You see the lander getting furthernand further away from Rosetta.,On the top right, you see an imagentaken at 60 meters by the lander,,60 meters above the surface of the comet.,The boulder there is some 10 meters.,So this is one of the last images we tooknbefore we landed on the comet.,Here, you see the whole sequence again,nbut from a different perspective,,and you see three blown-upsnfrom the bottom-left to the middle,of the lander travelingnover the surface of the comet.,Then, at the top, there is a beforenand an after image of the landing.,The only problem with the after image is,nthere is no lander.,But if you carefully looknat the right-hand side of this image,,we saw the lander still there, nbut it had bounced.,It had departed again. 
 Now, on a bit of a comical note here,is that originally Rosetta was designednto have a lander which would bounce.,That was discarded becausenit was way too expensive.,Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.,(Laughter),During the first bounce,nin the magnetometers,,you see here the data from them,nfrom the three axes, x, y and z.,Halfway through, you see a red line.,At that red line, there is a change.,What happened, apparently,nis during the first bounce,,somewhere, we hit the edge of a craternwith one of the legs of the lander,,and the rotation velocitynof the lander changed.,So we've been rather lucky,that we are where we are. 
 This is one ofnthe iconic images of Rosetta.,It's a man-made object,na leg of the lander,,standing on a comet.,This, for me, is one of the very bestnimages of space science I have ever seen. 
 (Applause) 
 One of the things we still have to donis to actually find the lander.,The blue area herenis where we know it must be.,We haven't been able to find it yet,nbut the search is continuing,,as are our efforts to start gettingnthe lander to work again.,We listen every day,,and we hope that between nownand somewhere in April,,the lander will wake up again. 
 The findings of whatnwe found on the comet:,This thing would float in water.,It's half the density of water.,So it looks likena very big rock, but it's not.,The activity increase we sawnin June, July, August last year,was a four-fold activity increase.,By the time we will be at the sun,,there will be 100 kilosna second leaving this comet:,gas, dust, whatever.,That's 100 million kilos a day. 
 Then, finally, the landing day.,I will never forget -- absolute madness,n250 TV crews in Germany.,The BBC was interviewing me,,and another TV crewnwho was following me all day,were filming me being interviewed,,and it went on like thatnfor the whole day.,The Discovery Channel crew,actually caught menwhen leaving the control room,,and they asked the right question,,and man, I got into tears,nand I still feel this.,For a month and a half,,I couldn't think aboutnlanding day without crying,,and I still have the emotion in me. 
 With this image of the comet,nI would like to leave you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)To be honest, by personality,,I'm just not much of a crier.,But I think in my careernthat's been a good thing.,I'm a civil rights lawyer,,and I've seen some nhorrible things in the world.,I began my career working npolice abuse cases in the United States.,And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda,to be the director of the U.N.'s ngenocide investigation.,It turns out that tears njust aren't much help,when you're trying nto investigate a genocide.,The things I had to see, nand feel and touch,were pretty unspeakable. 
 What I can tell you is this:,that the Rwandan genocide,was one of the world'sngreatest failures of simple compassion.,That word, compassion, actually ncomes from two Latin words:,cum passio, which simply mean n"to suffer with.",And the things that I saw and experienced,in Rwanda as I got up closento human suffering,,it did, in moments, move me to tears.,But I just wish that I, nand the rest of the world,,had been moved earlier.,And not just to tears,,but to actually stop the genocide. 
 Now by contrast, I've also been involved,with one of the world's greatestnsuccesses of compassion.,And that's the fight against nglobal poverty.,It's a cause that probablynhas involved all of us here.,I don't know if your first introduction,might have been choruses ofn"We Are the World,",or maybe the picture of a sponsored childnon your refrigerator door,,or maybe the birthday youndonated for fresh water.,I don't really remember what my firstnintroduction to poverty was,but I do remember the most jarring. 
 It was when I met Venus --,she's a mom from Zambia.,She's got three kids and she's a widow.,When I met her, she had walkednabout 12 miles,in the only garments she owned,,to come to the capital citynand to share her story.,She sat down with me for hours,,just ushered me in to nthe world of poverty.,She described what it was like nwhen the coals on the cooking fire,finally just went completely cold.,When that last drop nof cooking oil finally ran out.,When the last of the food, ndespite her best efforts,,ran out.,She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,,suffer from malnutrition,,as his legs just slowly bowed ninto uselessness.,As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.,And then as Peter finally grew cold. 
 For over 50 years, stories like thisnhave been moving us to compassion.,We whose kids have plenty to eat.,And we're moved not only nto care about global poverty,,but to actually try to do our part nto stop the suffering.,Now there's plenty of room for critique nthat we haven't done enough,,and what it is that we've donenhasn't been effective enough,,but the truth is this:,The fight against global povertynis probably the broadest,,longest running manifestation of the nhuman phenomenon of compassion,in the history of our species.,And so I'd like to sharena pretty shattering insight,that might forever change the waynyou think about that struggle. 
 But first, let me begin with whatnyou probably already know.,Thirty-five years ago, when I would havenbeen graduating from high school,,they told us that 40,000 kids every dayndied because of poverty.,That number, today, is now ndown to 17,000.,Way too many, of course,,but it does mean that every year,,there's eight million kids whondon't have to die from poverty.,Moreover, the number of npeople in our world,who are living in extreme poverty,,which is defined as living offnabout a dollar and a quarter a day,,that has fallen from 50 percent,,to only 15 percent.,This is massive progress,,and this exceeds everybody's nexpectations about what is possible.,And I think you and I,,I think, honestly, that we can nfeel proud and encouraged,to see the way that compassion nactually has the power,to succeed in stopping nthe suffering of millions. 
 But here's the part that you nmight not hear very much about.,If you move that poverty mark justnup to two dollars a day,,it turns out that virtually nthe same two billion people,who were stuck in that harsh povertynwhen I was in high school,,are still stuck there,,35 years later. 
 So why, why are so many billionsnstill stuck in such harsh poverty?,Well, let's think aboutnVenus for a moment.,Now for decades, my wife and I have beennmoved by common compassion,to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,,to support generous levels of foreign aid.,But until I had actually talked to Venus,,I would have had no idea that nnone of those approaches,actually addressed why she hadnto watch her son die.,"We were doing fine," Venus told me,,"until Brutus started to cause trouble.",Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor nand "cause trouble",is what happened the day afternVenus' husband died,,when Brutus just came and threwnVenus and the kids out of the house,,stole all their land, and robbedntheir market stall.,You see, Venus was thrown ninto destitution by violence. 
 And then it occurred to me, of course,,that none of my child sponsorships,nnone of the microloans,,none of the traditional nanti-poverty programs,were going to stop Brutus,,because they weren't meant to. 
 This became even more clearnto me when I met Griselda.,She's a marvelous young girlnliving in a very poor community,in Guatemala.,And one of the thingsnwe've learned over the years,is that perhaps the most powerful thing,that Griselda and her family can do,to get Griselda and her family nout of poverty,is to make sure that she goes to school.,The experts call this the Girl Effect.,But when we met Griselda, nshe wasn't going to school.,In fact, she was rarely ever nleaving her home. 
 Days before we met her,,while she was walking homenfrom church with her family,,in broad daylight,,men from her community njust snatched her off the street,,and violently raped her.,See, Griselda had everynopportunity to go to school,,it just wasn't safe for her to get there.,And Griselda's not the only one.,Around the world, poor women and girls,between the ages of 15 and 44,,they are -- when victims of nthe everyday violence,of domestic abuse and sexual violence --,those two forms of violence accountnfor more death and disability,than malaria, than car accidents,nthan war combined.,The truth is, the poor of our worldnare trapped in whole systems of violence. 
 In South Asia, for instance,nI could drive past this rice mill,and see this man hoisting nthese 100-pound sacks,of rice upon his thin back.,But I would have no idea, until later,,that he was actually a slave,,held by violence in that rice millnsince I was in high school.,Decades of anti-poverty programsnright in his community,were never able to rescue himnor any of the hundred other slaves,from the beatings and the rapesnand the torture,of violence inside the rice mill.,In fact, half a century of nanti-poverty programs,have left more poor people in slavery,than in any other time in human history. 
 Experts tell us that there's aboutn35 million people in slavery today.,That's about the population nof the entire nation of Canada,,where we're sitting today.,This is why, over time, I have comento call this epidemic of violence,the Locust Effect.,Because in the lives of the poor,nit just descends like a plague,and it destroys everything.,In fact, now when you surveynvery, very poor communities,,residents will tell you that theirngreatest fear is violence.,But notice the violence that they fear,is not the violence of ngenocide or the wars,,it's everyday violence. 
 So for me, as a lawyer, of course,nmy first reaction was to think,,well, of course we'vengot to change all the laws.,We've got to make all this violencenagainst the poor illegal.,But then I found out, it already is.,The problem is not that nthe poor don't get laws,,it's that they don't get law enforcement.,In the developing world,,basic law enforcement systemsnare so broken,that recently the U.N. issued na report that found,that "most poor people livenoutside the protection of the law.",Now honestly, you and I have njust about no idea,of what that would mean,because we have no nfirst-hand experience of it.,Functioning law enforcement for us nis just a total assumption.,In fact, nothing expresses that assumptionnmore clearly than three simple numbers:,9-1-1,,which, of course, is the numbernfor the emergency police operator,here in Canada and in the United States,,where the average response time nto a police 911 emergency call,is about 10 minutes.,So we take this just ncompletely for granted. 
 But what if there was no nlaw enforcement to protect you?,A woman in Oregon recentlynexperienced what this would be like.,She was home alone in her ndark house on a Saturday night,,when a man started to tear nhis way into her home.,This was her worst nightmare,,because this man had actually put hernin the hospital from an assault,just two weeks before.,So terrified, she picks up that phonenand does what any of us would do:,She calls 911 --,but only to learn that because nof budget cuts in her county,,law enforcement wasn't available non the weekends.,Listen.,Dispatcher: I don't have anybody nto send out there.,Woman: OK,Dispatcher: Um, obviously if he comesninside the residence and assaults you,,can you ask him to go away?,Or do you know ifnhe is intoxicated or anything?,Woman: I've already asked him.nI've already told him I was calling you.,He's broken in before,nbusted down my door, assaulted me.,Dispatcher: Uh-huh.,Woman: Um, yeah, so ...,Dispatcher: Is there any way you couldnsafely leave the residence?,Woman: No, I can't, because he's blockingnpretty much my only way out.,Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do nis give you some advice,,and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.,Obviously, if he comes in andnunfortunately has a weapon,or is trying to cause you physical harm,nthat's a different story.,You know, the sheriff's officendoesn't work up there.,I don't have anybody to send." 
 Gary Haugen: Tragically, the woman ninside that house,was violently assaulted, choked and raped,because this is what it means to livenoutside the rule of law.,And this is where billionsnof our poorest live.,What does that look like?,In Bolivia, for example, if a man nsexually assaults a poor child,,statistically, he's at greater risknof slipping in the shower and dying,than he is of ever going nto jail for that crime.,In South Asia, if you nenslave a poor person,,you're at greater risk of being nstruck by lightning,than ever being sent nto jail for that crime.,And so the epidemic of everyday nviolence, it just rages on.,And it devastates our efforts to trynto help billions of people,out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.,Because the data just doesn't lie.,It turns out that you can give nall manner of goods and services,to the poor,,but if you don't restrain the hands nof the violent bullies,from taking it all away,,you're going to be very disappointednin the long-term impact of your efforts. 
 So you would think that the disintegrationnof basic law enforcement,in the developing worldnwould be a huge priority,for the global fight against poverty.,But it's not.,Auditors of international assistancenrecently couldn't find,even one percent of aid going nto protect the poor,from the lawless chaos nof everyday violence.,And honestly, when we do talk about nviolence against the poor,,sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.,A fresh water organization tellsna heart-wrenching story,of girls who are raped on the waynto fetching water,,and then celebratesnthe solution of a new well,that drastically shortens their walk.,End of story.,But not a word about the rapists whonare still right there in the community.,If a young woman on one nof our college campuses,was raped on her walk to the library,,we would never celebrate the solutionnof moving the library closer to the dorm.,And yet, for some reason,nthis is okay for poor people. 
 Now the truth is, the traditional experts,in economic developmentnand poverty alleviation,,they don't know how to fix this problem.,And so what happens?,They don't talk about it.,But the more fundamental reason,that law enforcement for the poornin the developing world,is so neglected,,is because the people insidenthe developing world, with money,,don't need it.,I was at the World Economic nForum not long ago,talking to corporate executives who havenmassive businesses in the developing world,and I was just asking them,,"How do you guys protect all your peoplenand property from all the violence?",And they looked at each other, nand they said, practically in unison,,"We buy it." 
 Indeed, private security forces nin the developing world,are now, four, five and seven timesnlarger than the public police force.,In Africa, the largest employer non the continent now is private security.,But see, the rich can pay for safetynand can keep getting richer,,but the poor can't pay for itnand they're left totally unprotected,and they keep getting thrownnto the ground. 
 This is a massive and scandalous outrage.,And it doesn't have to be this way.,Broken law enforcement can be fixed.,Violence can be stopped.,Almost all criminal justice systems,,they start out broken and corrupt,,but they can be transformednby fierce effort and commitment. 
 The path forward is really pretty clear.,Number one: We have to start making,stopping violence indispensable nto the fight against poverty.,In fact, any conversationnabout global poverty,that doesn't include the problem nof violence must be deemed not serious. 
 And secondly, we have to begin nto seriously invest resources,and share expertise to support nthe developing world,as they fashion new, npublic systems of justice,,not private security,,that give everybody a chance to be safe.,These transformations nare actually possible,and they're happening today.,Recently, the Gates Foundation nfunded a project,in the second largest city nof the Philippines,,where local advocatesnand local law enforcement,were able to transform corrupt policenand broken courts so drastically,,that in just four short years,,they were able to measurably reduce,the commercial sexual violence nagainst poor kids by 79 percent. 
 You know, from the hindsight of history,,what's always most inexplicablenand inexcusable,are the simple failures of compassion.,Because I think history convenes na tribunal of our grandchildren,and they just ask us,,"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?,Where were you, Grandpa, when nthe Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany,and were being rejected from our shores?,Where were you?,And Grandma, where were younwhen they were marching,our Japanese-American neighborsnoff to internment camps?,And Grandpa, where were you nwhen they were beating,our African-American neighbors,just because they were tryingnto register to vote?",Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,,"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you,when two billion of the world's poorestnwere drowning in a lawless chaos,of everyday violence?",I hope we can say that we had compassion,nthat we raised our voice,,and as a generation, we were movednto make the violence stop. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.,Talk to us a bit aboutnsome of the things,that have actually been happening to,nfor example, boost police training.,How hard a process is that?,GH: Well, one of the glorious nthings that's starting to happen now,is that the collapse of these systemsnand the consequences are becoming obvious.,There's actually, now, npolitical will to do that.,But it just requires now an investmentnof resources and transfer of expertise.,There's a political will struggle nthat's going to take place as well,,but those are winnable fights,,because we've done some examplesnaround the world,at International Justice Missionnthat are very encouraging. 
 CA: So just tell us in one country,nhow much it costs,to make a material difference nto police, for example --,I know that's only one piece of it.,GH: In Guatemala, for instance,nwe've started a project there,with the local police nand court system, prosecutors,,to retrain them so that they can nactually effectively bring these cases.,And we've seen prosecutions againstnperpetrators of sexual violence,increase by more than 1,000 percent.,This project has been very modestly fundednat about a million dollars a year,,and the kind of bang nyou can get for your buck,in terms of leveragingna criminal justice system,that could function if it were properlyntrained and motivated and led,,and these countries, nespecially a middle class,that is seeing that there's nreally no future,with this total instability andntotal privatization of security,I think there's an opportunity,na window for change. 
 CA: But to make this happen, you havento look at each part in the chain --,the police, who else?,GH: So that's the thing nabout law enforcement,,it starts out with the police,,they're the front endnof the pipeline of justice,,but they hand if off to the prosecutors,,and the prosecutors nhand it off to the courts,,and the survivors of violence nhave to be supported by social services,all the way through that.,So you have to do an approach nthat pulls that all together.,In the past, there's been a little bitnof training of the courts,,but they get crappy evidence nfrom the police,,or a little police intervention nthat has to do with narcotics or terrorism,but nothing to do with treatingnthe common poor person,with excellent law enforcement,,so it's about pulling that all together,,and you can actually have peoplenin very poor communities,experience law enforcement like us,,which is imperfect in our nown experience, for sure,,but boy, is it a great thing to sensenthat you can call 911,and maybe someone will protect you. 
 CA: Gary, I think you've done na spectacular job,of bringing this to the world's attention,in your book and right here today. 
 Thanks so much. 
 Gary Haugen. 
 (Applause)My first love was for the night sky.,Love is complicated. 
 You're looking at a fly-through of the nHubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,,one of the most distant imagesnof our universe ever observed.,Everything you see here is a galaxy,,comprised of billions of stars each.,And the farthest galaxy is na trillion, trillion kilometers away. 
 As an astrophysicist, I haventhe awesome privilege of studying,some of the most exotic objects nin our universe.,The objects that have captivated me nfrom first crush throughout my career,are supermassive, nhyperactive black holes.,Weighing one to 10 billion times nthe mass of our own sun,,these galactic black holes nare devouring material,,at a rate of upwards of n1,000 times more,than your "average" nsupermassive black hole.,(Laughter) 
 These two characteristics,,with a few others, make them quasars.,At the same time, the objects I study,are producing some of the mostnpowerful particle streams,ever observed.,These narrow streams, called jets,,are moving at 99.99 percent nof the speed of light,,and are pointed directly at the Earth. 
 These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactivenand supermassive black holes,are called blazars, or blazing quasars.,What makes blazars so specialnis that they're some of the universe's,most efficient particle accelerators,,transporting incredible amountsnof energy throughout a galaxy. 
 Here, I'm showing annartist's conception of a blazar.,The dinner plate by which nmaterial falls onto the black hole,is called the accretion disc,,shown here in blue.,Some of that material is slingshottednaround the black hole,and accelerated to insanely high speeds,in the jet, shown here in white.,Although the blazar system is rare,,the process by which naturenpulls in material via a disk,,and then flings some of it out via a jet,nis more common.,We'll eventually zoom out of nthe blazar system,to show its approximate relationshipnto the larger galactic context. 
 Beyond the cosmic accountingnof what goes in to what goes out,,one of the hot topics in nblazar astrophysics right now,is where the highest-energy njet emission comes from.,In this image, I'm interestednin where this white blob forms,and if, as a result, there's any nrelationship between the jet,and the accretion disc material. 
 Clear answers to this question,were almost completelyninaccessible until 2008,,when NASA launched a new telescopenthat better detects gamma ray light --,that is, light with energiesna million times higher,than your standard x-ray scan.,I simultaneously compare variationsnbetween the gamma ray light data,and the visible light data fromnday to day and year to year,,to better localize these gamma ray blobs.,My research shows that in some instances,,these blobs form much closernto the black hole,than we initially thought. 
 As we more confidently localize,where these gamma ray nblobs are forming,,we can better understand how jetsnare being accelerated,,and ultimately reveal nthe dynamic processes,by which some of the most fascinatingnobjects in our universe are formed. 
 This all started as a love story.,And it still is.,This love transformed me from na curious, stargazing young girl,to a professional astrophysicist,,hot on the heels of celestial discovery.,Who knew that chasing after the universe,would ground me so deeplynto my mission here on Earth.,Then again, when do we ever knownwhere love's first flutter,will truly take us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: You were somethingnof a mathematical phenom.,You had already taught at Harvardnand MIT at a young age.,And then the NSA came calling.,What was that about? 
 Jim Simons: Well the NSA --nthat's the National Security Agency --,they didn't exactly come calling.,They had an operation at Princeton,nwhere they hired mathematicians,to attack secret codesnand stuff like that.,And I knew that existed.,And they had a very good policy,,because you could do half your timenat your own mathematics,,and at least half your timenworking on their stuff.,And they paid a lot.,So that was an irresistible pull.,So, I went there. 
 CA: You were a code-cracker. 
 JS: I was. 
 CA: Until you got fired. 
 JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes. 
 CA: How come? 
 JS: Well, how come?,I got fired because,nwell, the Vietnam War was on,,and the boss of bosses in my organizationnwas a big fan of the war,and wrote a New York Times article,na magazine section cover story,,about how we would win in Vietnam.,And I didn't like that war,nI thought it was stupid.,And I wrote a letter to the Times,nwhich they published,,saying not everyonenwho works for Maxwell Taylor,,if anyone remembers that name,nagrees with his views.,And I gave my own views ... 
 CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would -- 
 JS: ... which were differentnfrom General Taylor's.,But in the end, nobody said anything.,But then, I was 29 years old at this time,nand some kid came around,and said he was a stringernfrom Newsweek magazine,and he wanted to interview menand ask what I was doing about my views.,And I told him, "I'm doingnmostly mathematics now,,and when the war is over,nthen I'll do mostly their stuff.",Then I did the onlynintelligent thing I'd done that day --,I told my local bossnthat I gave that interview.,And he said, "What'd you say?",And I told him what I said.,And then he said,n"I've got to call Taylor.",He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.,I was fired five minutes after that. 
 CA: OK. 
 JS: But it wasn't bad. 
 CA: It wasn't bad,nbecause you went on to Stony Brook,and stepped up your mathematical career.,You started working with this man here.,Who is this? 
 JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.,Chern was one of the greatnmathematicians of the century.,I had known him whennI was a graduate student at Berkeley.,And I had some ideas,,and I brought them to himnand he liked them.,Together, we did this worknwhich you can easily see up there.,There it is. 
 CA: It led to you publishingna famous paper together.,Can you explain at all what that work was? 
 JS: No. 
 (Laughter) 
 JS: I mean, I couldnexplain it to somebody. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: How about explaining this? 
 JS: But not many. Not many people. 
 CA: I think you told menit had something to do with spheres,,so let's start here. 
 JS: Well, it did,nbut I'll say about that work --,it did have something to do with that,nbut before we get to that --,that work was good mathematics.,I was very happy with it; so was Chern.,It even started a little sub-fieldnthat's now flourishing.,But, more interestingly,nit happened to apply to physics,,something we knew nothing about --nat least I knew nothing about physics,,and I don't think Chernnknew a heck of a lot.,And about 10 yearsnafter the paper came out,,a guy named Ed Witten in Princetonnstarted applying it to string theory,and people in Russia started applying itnto what's called "condensed matter.",Today, those things in therencalled Chern-Simons invariants,have spread through a lot of physics.,And it was amazing.,We didn't know any physics.,It never occurred to menthat it would be applied to physics.,But that's the thing about mathematics --nyou never know where it's going to go. 
 CA: This is so incredible.,So, we've been talking aboutnhow evolution shapes human minds,that may or may not perceive the truth.,Somehow, you come upnwith a mathematical theory,,not knowing any physics,,discover two decades laternthat it's being applied,to profoundly describenthe actual physical world.,How can that happen? 
 JS: God knows. 
 (Laughter) 
 But there's a famous physicistnnamed [Eugene] Wigner,,and he wrote an essay on the unreasonableneffectiveness of mathematics.,Somehow, this mathematics,nwhich is rooted in the real world,in some sense -- we learn to count,nmeasure, everyone would do that --,and then it flourishes on its own.,But so often it comesnback to save the day.,General relativity is an example.,[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry,nand Einstein realized,,"Hey! It's the very thingnin which I can cast general relativity.",So, you never know. It is a mystery.,It is a mystery. 
 CA: So, here's a mathematicalnpiece of ingenuity.,Tell us about this. 
 JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere,nand it has a lattice around it --,you know, those squares.,What I'm going to show here wasnoriginally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,,the great mathematician, in the 1700s.,And it gradually grew to bena very important field in mathematics:,algebraic topology, geometry.,That paper up there had its roots in this.,So, here's this thing:,it has eight vertices,n12 edges, six faces.,And if you look at the difference --nvertices minus edges plus faces --,you get two.,OK, well, two. That's a good number.,Here's a different way of doing it --nthese are triangles covering --,this has 12 vertices and 30 edges,and 20 faces, 20 tiles.,And vertices minus edgesnplus faces still equals two.,And in fact, you could do thisnany which way --,cover this thing with all kindsnof polygons and triangles,and mix them up.,And you take vertices minus edgesnplus faces -- you'll get two.,Here's a different shape.,This is a torus, or the surfacenof a doughnut: 16 vertices,covered by these rectangles,n32 edges, 16 faces.,Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.,It'll always come out to zero.,Every time you cover a torusnwith squares or triangles,or anything like that,nyou're going to get zero.,So, this is callednthe Euler characteristic.,And it's what's calledna topological invariant.,It's pretty amazing.,No matter how you do it,nyou're always get the same answer.,So that was the first sort of thrust,nfrom the mid-1700s,,into a subject which is now callednalgebraic topology. 
 CA: And your own workntook an idea like this and moved it,into higher-dimensional theory,,higher-dimensional objects,nand found new invariances? 
 JS: Yes. Well, there were alreadynhigher-dimensional invariants:,Pontryagin classes --nactually, there were Chern classes.,There were a bunchnof these types of invariants.,I was struggling to work on one of them,and model it sort of combinatorially,,instead of the way it was typically done,,and that led to this worknand we uncovered some new things.,But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --,who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics,and had 13 children,,who he apparently would dandle on his kneenwhile he was writing --,if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn'tnperhaps be these invariants. 
 CA: OK, so that's at least given usna flavor of that amazing mind in there.,Let's talk about Renaissance.,Because you took that amazing mindnand having been a code-cracker at the NSA,,you started to become a code-crackernin the financial industry.,I think you probably didn't buynefficient market theory.,Somehow you found a way of creatingnastonishing returns over two decades.,The way it's been explained to me,,what's remarkable about what you didnwasn't just the size of the returns,,it's that you took themnwith surprisingly low volatility and risk,,compared with other hedge funds.,So how on earth did you do this, Jim? 
 JS: I did it by assemblingna wonderful group of people.,When I started doing trading, I hadngotten a little tired of mathematics.,I was in my late 30s,nI had a little money.,I started trading and it went very well.,I made quite a lot of moneynwith pure luck.,I mean, I think it was pure luck.,It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.,But in looking at the data,nafter a while I realized:,it looks like there's some structure here.,And I hired a few mathematicians,nand we started making some models --,just the kind of thing we did backnat IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].,You design an algorithm,nyou test it out on a computer.,Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on. 
 CA: Can we take a look at this?,Because here's a typical graphnof some commodity.,I look at that, and I say,n"That's just a random, up-and-down walk --,maybe a slight upward trendnover that whole period of time.",How on earth could you tradenlooking at that,,and see something that wasn't just random? 
 JS: In the old days -- this isnkind of a graph from the old days,,commodities or currenciesnhad a tendency to trend.,Not necessarily the very light trendnyou see here, but trending in periods.,And if you decided, OK,nI'm going to predict today,,by the average move in the past 20 days --,maybe that would be a good prediction,nand I'd make some money.,And in fact, years ago,nsuch a system would work --,not beautifully, but it would work.,You'd make money, you'd losenmoney, you'd make money.,But this is a year's worth of days,,and you'd make a little moneynduring that period.,It's a very vestigial system. 
 CA: So you would testna bunch of lengths of trends in time,and see whether, for example,,a 10-day trend or a 15-day trendnwas predictive of what happened next. 
 JS: Sure, you would try all those thingsnand see what worked best.,Trend-following wouldnhave been great in the '60s,,and it was sort of OK in the '70s.,By the '80s, it wasn't. 
 CA: Because everyone could see that.,So, how did you stay ahead of the pack? 
 JS: We stayed ahead of the packnby finding other approaches --,shorter-term approaches to some extent.,The real thing was to gatherna tremendous amount of data --,and we had to get it by handnin the early days.,We went down to the Federal Reservenand copied interest rate histories,and stuff like that,nbecause it didn't exist on computers.,We got a lot of data.,And very smart people -- that was the key.,I didn't really know how to hirenpeople to do fundamental trading.,I had hired a few -- some made money,nsome didn't make money.,I couldn't make a business out of that.,But I did know how to hire scientists,,because I have some tastenin that department.,So, that's what we did.,And gradually these modelsngot better and better,,and better and better. 
 CA: You're credited with doingnsomething remarkable at Renaissance,,which is building this culture,nthis group of people,,who weren't just hired gunsnwho could be lured away by money.,Their motivation was doingnexciting mathematics and science. 
 JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.,But some of it was money. 
 CA: They made a lot of money. 
 JS: I can't say that no one camenbecause of the money.,I think a lot of themncame because of the money.,But they also camenbecause it would be fun. 
 CA: What role did machine learningnplay in all this? 
 JS: In a certain sense,nwhat we did was machine learning.,You look at a lot of data, and you trynto simulate different predictive schemes,,until you get better and better at it.,It doesn't necessarily feed back on itselfnthe way we did things.,But it worked. 
 CA: So these different predictive schemesncan be really quite wild and unexpected.,I mean, you looked at everything, right?,You looked at the weather,nlength of dresses, political opinion. 
 JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try. 
 CA: What sort of things? 
 JS: Well, everything.,Everything is grist for the mill --nexcept hem lengths.,Weather, annual reports,,quarterly reports, historic data itself,nvolumes, you name it.,Whatever there is.,We take in terabytes of data a day.,And store it away and massage itnand get it ready for analysis.,You're looking for anomalies.,You're looking for -- like you said,,the efficient marketnhypothesis is not correct. 
 CA: But any one anomalynmight be just a random thing.,So, is the secret here to just looknat multiple strange anomalies,,and see when they align? 
 JS: Any one anomalynmight be a random thing;,however, if you have enough datanyou can tell that it's not.,You can see an anomaly that's persistentnfor a sufficiently long time --,the probability of it beingnrandom is not high.,But these things fade after a while;nanomalies can get washed out.,So you have to keep on topnof the business. 
 CA: A lot of people looknat the hedge fund industry now,and are sort of ... shocked by it,,by how much wealth is created there,,and how much talent is going into it.,Do you have any worriesnabout that industry,,and perhaps the financialnindustry in general?,Kind of being on a runaway train that's --,I don't know --nhelping increase inequality?,How would you champion what's happeningnin the hedge fund industry? 
 JS: I think in the lastnthree or four years,,hedge funds have not done especially well.,We've done dandy,,but the hedge fund industry as a wholenhas not done so wonderfully.,The stock market has been on a roll,ngoing up as everybody knows,,and price-earnings ratios have grown.,So an awful lot of the wealthnthat's been created in the last --,let's say, five or six years --nhas not been created by hedge funds.,People would ask me,n"What's a hedge fund?",And I'd say, "One and 20.",Which means -- now it's two and 20 --,it's two percent fixed feenand 20 percent of profits.,Hedge funds are allndifferent kinds of creatures. 
 CA: Rumor has it you chargenslightly higher fees than that. 
 JS: We charged the highest feesnin the world at one time.,Five and 44, that's what we charge. 
 CA: Five and 44.,So five percent flat,n44 percent of upside.,You still made your investorsnspectacular amounts of money. 
 JS: We made good returns, yes.,People got very mad:n"How can you charge such high fees?",I said, "OK, you can withdraw.",But "How can I get more?"nwas what people were -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But at a certain point,nas I think I told you,,we bought out all the investorsnbecause there's a capacity to the fund. 
 CA: But should we worrynabout the hedge fund industry,attracting too much of the world'sngreat mathematical and other talent,to work on that, as opposednto the many other problems in the world? 
 JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.,We hire astronomers and physicistsnand things like that.,I don't think we should worrynabout it too much.,It's still a pretty small industry.,And in fact, bringing scienceninto the investing world,has improved that world.,It's reduced volatility.nIt's increased liquidity.,Spreads are narrower becausenpeople are trading that kind of stuff.,So I'm not too worried about Einsteinngoing off and starting a hedge fund. 
 CA: You're at a phase in your life nownwhere you're actually investing, though,,at the other end of the supply chain --,you're actually boostingnmathematics across America.,This is your wife, Marilyn.,You're working onnphilanthropic issues together.,Tell me about that. 
 JS: Well, Marilyn started --,there she is up there,nmy beautiful wife --,she started the foundationnabout 20 years ago.,I think '94.,I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,,but it was one of those two years. 
 (Laughter) 
 We started the foundation,njust as a convenient way to give charity.,She kept the books, and so on.,We did not have a vision at that time,nbut gradually a vision emerged --,which was to focus on math and science,nto focus on basic research.,And that's what we've done.,Six years ago or so, I left Renaissancenand went to work at the foundation.,So that's what we do. 
 CA: And so Math for Americanis basically investing,in math teachers around the country,,giving them some extra income,ngiving them support and coaching.,And really tryingnto make that more effective,and make that a callingnto which teachers can aspire. 
 JS: Yeah -- instead of beating upnthe bad teachers,,which has created morale problemsnall through the educational community,,in particular in math and science,,we focus on celebrating the good onesnand giving them status.,Yeah, we give them extra money,n15,000 dollars a year.,We have 800 math and science teachersnin New York City in public schools today,,as part of a core.,There's a great morale among them.,They're staying in the field.,Next year, it'll be 1,000nand that'll be 10 percent,of the math and science teachersnin New York [City] public schools. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Jim, here's another projectnthat you've supported philanthropically:,Research into origins of life, I guess.,What are we looking at here?,JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.,And then I'll tell younwhat you're looking at.,Origins of life is a fascinating question.,How did we get here?,Well, there are two questions:,One is, what is the routenfrom geology to biology --,how did we get here?,And the other question is,nwhat did we start with?,What material, if any,ndid we have to work with on this route?,Those are two very,nvery interesting questions.,The first question is a tortuous pathnfrom geology up to RNA,or something like that --nhow did that all work?,And the other,nwhat do we have to work with?,Well, more than we think.,So what's pictured therenis a star in formation.,Now, every year in our Milky Way,nwhich has 100 billion stars,,about two new stars are created.,Don't ask me how, but they're created.,And it takes them about a millionnyears to settle out.,So, in steady state,,there are about two million starsnin formation at any time.,That one is somewherenalong this settling-down period.,And there's all this crapnsort of circling around it,,dust and stuff.,And it'll form probably a solar system,nor whatever it forms.,But here's the thing --,in this dust that surrounds a forming star,have been found, now,nsignificant organic molecules.,Molecules not just like methane,nbut formaldehyde and cyanide --,things that are the building blocks --nthe seeds, if you will -- of life.,So, that may be typical.,And it may be typicalnthat planets around the universe,start off with some of thesenbasic building blocks.,Now does that meannthere's going to be life all around?,Maybe.,But it's a questionnof how tortuous this path is,from those frail beginnings,nthose seeds, all the way to life.,And most of those seedsnwill fall on fallow planets. 
 CA: So for you, personally,,finding an answer to this questionnof where we came from,,of how did this thing happen,nthat is something you would love to see. 
 JS: Would love to see.,And like to know --,if that path is tortuous enough,nand so improbable,,that no matter what you start with,nwe could be a singularity.,But on the other hand,,given all this organic dustnthat's floating around,,we could have lots of friends out there.,It'd be great to know. 
 CA: Jim, a couple of years ago,nI got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,,and I asked him the secret of his success,,and he said takingnphysics seriously was it.,Listening to you, what I hear you sayingnis taking math seriously,,that has infused your whole life.,It's made you an absolute fortune,nand now it's allowing you to invest,in the futures of thousands and thousandsnof kids across America and elsewhere.,Could it be that science actually works?,That math actually works? 
 JS: Well, math certainly works.nMath certainly works.,But this has been fun.,Working with Marilyn and giving it awaynhas been very enjoyable. 
 CA: I just find it --nit's an inspirational thought to me,,that by taking knowledge seriously,nso much more can come from it.,So thank you for your amazing life,nand for coming here to TED. 
 Thank you. 
 Jim Simons! 
 (Applause)There's this quote by activist and punknrock musician Jello Biafra that I love.,He says, "Don't hate the media.nBe the media.",I'm an artist.,I like working with media and technologynbecause A, I'm familiar with them,and I like the power they hold.,And B, I hate them and I'm terrifiednof the power they hold. 
 (Laughter) 
 I remember watching, in 2003, an interviewnbetween Fox News host Tony Snow,and then-US Defense Secretary,nDonald Rumsfeld.,They were talkingnabout the recent invasion of Iraq,,and Rumsfeld is asked the question,,"Well, we're hear about our body counts,,but we never hear about theirs, why?",And Rumsfeld's answer is,,"Well, we don't do body countsnon other people.",Right? 
 It's estimated that between 150,000nto one million Iraqis, civilians,,have died as a resultnof the US-led invasion in 2003.,That number is in stark contrast withnthe 4,486 US service members who died,during that same window of time.,I wanted to do more than just bringnawareness to this terrifying number.,I wanted to create a monumentnfor the individual civilians,who died as a result of the invasion. 
 Monuments to war,nsuch as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial,,are often enormous in scale.,Very powerful and very one-sided.,I wanted my monument to livenin the world, and to circulate.,I remember when I was a boy in school,,my teacher assigned usnthis classic civics assignment,where you take a sheet of papernand you write a member of your government.,And we were told,nif we wrote a really good letter,,if we really thought about it,,we would get back more than justna simple formed letter as a reply. 
 This is my "Notepad.",What looks like an everyday,nyellow legal tablet of paper,is actually a monumentnto the individual Iraqi civilians,that died as a result of the US invasion.,"Notepad" is an act of protestnand an act of commemoration,disguised as an everyday tablet of paper.,The lines of the paper, when magnified,,are revealed to be micro-printed text,that contains the details, the names,nthe dates and locations,of individual Iraqi civilians that died. 
 So, for the last 5 years, I've been takingnpads of this paper, tons of this stuff,,and smuggling itninto the stationery supplies,of the United Statesnand the Coalition governments. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I don't have to tell you guys this is notnthe place to discuss how I did that. 
 (Laughter) 
 But also, I've been meeting one-on-onenwith members and former members,of the so-called Coalition of the Willing,nwho assisted in the invasion. 
 And so, whenever I can,nI meet with one of them,,and I share the project with them.,And last summer, I had the chance to meet,with former United States Attorney Generalnand Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales. 
 (Video) Matt Kenyon:nMay I give this to you?,This is a special legal tablet.,It's actually partnof an ongoing art project. 
 Alberto Gonzalez:nThis is a special legal pad? 
 MK: Yes. You won't believe me,,but it's in the collection of the Museumnof Modern Art; I'm an artist. 
 MK: And all of the linesnof the paper are actually -- 
 AG: Are they going to disappear? 
 MK: No, they're micro-printed text,that contains the namesnof individual Iraqi civilians,who have died since the invasion of Iraq. 
 AG: Yeah. OK. 
 AG: Thank you. MK: Thank you. 
 (Laughter) 
 The way he says "thank you"nreally creeps me out. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so I'd like each of younto look under your chairs.,There's an envelope.,And please open it.,The paper you're holding in your hand,contains the details of Iraqi civiliansnthat died as result of the invasion.,I'd like you to use this papernand write a member of government.,You can help to smugglenthis civilian body count,into government archives.,Because every letternthat's sent in to the government,,and this is all acrossnthe world, of course --,every letter that is sent innis archived, filed and recorded.,Together, we can put this in the mailboxesnand under the noses of people in power.,Everything that's sent in,eventually becomes part of the permanentnarchive of our government,,our shared historical record. 
 Thank you.

 Tom Rielly: So, tell me Matt,,how did this ideancome into your head, of "Notepad"? 
 Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project,that dealt withnthe US Coalition side of the war,and it was a black armband that was callednthe "Improvised Empathetic Device",which accumulated, in real time,,the names, ranks,ncause of death and location,of US service membersnwho had died overseas,,and each time the Department of Defensenor CENTCOM released their data,,it would stab me in the arm.,And so, I became awarenthat there was a spectacle,associated with our own peoplenwho were dying overseas,,but a disproportionatenamount of casualties,were the civilian casualties. 
 TR: Thank you so much. 
 MK: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, you know, sometimes,the most important things comenin the smallest packages.,I am going to try to convince you,nin the 15 minutes I have,,that microbes have a lot to saynabout questions such as,,"Are we alone?",and they can tell us more aboutnnot only life in our solar system,but also maybe beyond,,and this is why I am tracking them downnin the most impossible places on Earth,,in extreme environments where conditions,are really pushing themnto the brink of survival.,Actually, sometimes me too,nwhen I'm trying to follow them too close.,But here's the thing:,We are the only advanced civilizationnin the solar system,,but that doesn't mean that there isnno microbial life nearby.,In fact, the planetsnand moons you see here,could host life -- all of them --nand we know that,,and it's a strong possibility.,And if we were going to find lifenon those moons and planets,,then we would answer questions such as,,are we alone in the solar system?,Where are we coming from?,Do we have family in the neighborhood?,Is there life beyond our solar system? 
 And we can ask all those questionsnbecause there has been a revolution,in our understandingnof what a habitable planet is,,and today, a habitable planet is a planet,that has a zone wherenwater can stay stable,,but to me this is a horizontalndefinition of habitability,,because it involves a distance to a star,,but there is anotherndimension to habitability,,and this is a vertical dimension.,Think of it as,conditions in the subsurface of a planetnwhere you are very far away from a sun,,but you still have water,nenergy, nutrients,,which for some of them means food,,and a protection.,And when you look at the Earth,,very far away from any sunlight,ndeep in the ocean,,you have life thriving,and it uses only chemistrynfor life processes. 
 So when you think of it nat that point, all walls collapse.,You have no limitations, basically.,And if you have been lookingnat the headlines lately,,then you will see that we havendiscovered a subsurface ocean,on Europa, on Ganymede,non Enceladus, on Titan,,and now we are finding a geysernand hot springs on Enceladus,,Our solar system is turningninto a giant spa.,For anybody who has gone to a spanknows how much microbes like that, right?,(Laughter) 
 So at that point, think also about Mars.,There is no life possiblenat the surface of Mars today,,but it might still be hiding underground. 
 So, we have been making progressnin our understanding of habitability,,but we also have been making progressnin our understanding,of what the signaturesnof life are on Earth.,And you can have what we callnorganic molecules,,and these are the bricks of life,,and you can have fossils,,and you can minerals, biominerals,,which is due to the reactionnbetween bacteria and rocks,,and of course you can havengases in the atmosphere.,And when you look at thosentiny green algae,on the right of the slide here,,they are the direct descendantsnof those who have been pumping oxygen,a billion years agonin the atmosphere of the Earth.,When they did that, they poisonedn90 percent of the life,at the surface of the Earth,,but they are the reason whynyou are breathing this air today. 
 But as much as our understanding growsnof all of these things,,there is one questionnwe still cannot answer,,and this is, where are we coming from?,And you know, it's getting worse,,because we won't be ablento find the physical evidence,of where we are coming fromnon this planet,,and the reason being is that anything thatnis older than four billion years is gone.,All record is gone,,erased by plate tectonics and erosion.,This is what I call the Earth'snbiological horizon.,Beyond this horizon we don't knownwhere we are coming from. 
 So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.,And we might be able to findnevidence of our own origin,in the most unlikely place,nand this place in Mars. 
 How is this possible?,Well clearly at the beginningnof the solar system,,Mars and the Earth were bombardednby giant asteroids and comets,,and there were ejectanfrom these impacts all over the place.,Earth and Mars kept throwing rocksnat each other for a very long time.,Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.,Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.,So clearly, those two planets may havenbeen seeded by the same material.,So yeah, maybe Granddady is sittingnthere on the surface and waiting for us.,But that also means that we can go to Marsnand try to find traces of our own origin.,Mars may hold that secret for us.,This is why Mars is so special to us. 
 But for that to happen,,Mars needed to be habitablenat the time when conditions were right.,So was Mars habitable?,We have a number of missionsntelling us exactly the same thing today.,At the time when lifenappeared on the Earth,,Mars did have an ocean,nit had volcanoes, it had lakes,,and it had deltas like the beautifulnpicture you see here.,This picture was sent by the Curiosity nrover only a few weeks ago.,It shows the remnants of a delta,nand this picture tells us something:,water was abundant,and stayed founting at the surfacenfor a very long time.,This is good news for life.,Life chemistry takes a long timento actually happen. 
 So this is extremely good news,,but does that mean that if we go there,nlife will be easy to find on Mars?,Not necessarily. 
 Here's what happened:,At the time when life explodednat the surface of the Earth,,then everything went south for Mars,,literally.,The atmosphere wasnstripped away by solar winds,,Mars lost its magnetosphere,,and then cosmic rays and U.V.nbombarded the surface,and water escaped to spacenand went underground.,So if we want to be able to understand,,if we want to be able to find those tracesnof the signatures of life,at the surface of Mars, if they are there,,we need to understand what wasnthe impact of each of these events,on the preservation of its record.,Only then will we be ablento know where those signatures are hiding,,and only then will we be ablento send our rover to the right places,where we can sample those rocksnthat may be telling us something,really important about who we are,,or, if not, maybe telling usnthat somewhere, independently,,life has appeared on another planet. 
 So to do that, it's easy.,You only need to go backn3.5 billion years ago,in the past of a planet.,We just need a time machine. 
 Easy, right?,Well, actually, it is.,Look around you -- that's planet Earth.,This is our time machine.,Geologists are using itnto go back in the past of our own planet.,I am using it a little bit differently.,I use planet Earth to gonin very extreme environments,where conditions were similarnto those of Mars,at the time when the climate changed,,and there I'm trying nto understand what happened.,What are the signatures of life?,What is left? How are we going to find it?,So for one moment nownI'm going to take you with me,on a trip into that time machine. 
 And now, what you see here,nwe are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,,but in fact we are less than a billionnyears after the Earth and Mars formed.,The Earth and Mars will have lookednpretty much exactly like that --,volcanoes everywhere,nevaporating lakes everywhere,,minerals, hot springs,,and then you see those moundsnon the shore of those lakes?,Those are built by the descendantsnof the first organisms,that gave us the first fossil on Earth. 
 But if we want to understand what's ngoing on, we need to go a little further.,And the other thing about those sites,is that exactly like on Marsnthree and a half billion years ago,,the climate is changing very fast,nand water and ice are disappearing.,But we need to go back to that timenwhen everything changed on Mars,,and to do that, we need to go higher.,Why is that?,Because when you go higher,,the atmosphere is getting thinner,nit's getting more unstable,,the temperature is getting cooler,nand you have a lot more U.V. radiation.,Basically,,you are getting to those conditionsnon Mars when everything changed. 
 So I was not promising anything aboutna leisurely trip on the time machine.,You are not going to be sittingnin that time machine.,You have to haul 1,000 poundsnof equipment to the summit,of this 20,000-foot volcanonin the Andes here.,That's about 6,000 meters.,And you also have to sleepnon 42-degree slopes,and really hope that there won'tnbe any earthquake that night.,But when we get to the summit,nwe actually find the lake we came for.,At this altitude, this lake isnexperiencing exactly the same conditions,as those on Marsnthree and a half billion years ago.,And now we have to change our voyage,into an inner voyage inside that lake,,and to do that, we have to removenour mountain gear,and actually don suits and go for it.,But at the time we enter that lake,nat the very moment we enter that lake,,we are stepping back,three and a half billion yearsnin the past of another planet,,and then we are going to getnthe answer came for.,Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.,Everything you see in this picturenis a living organism.,Maybe not so the diver,nbut everything else.,But this picture is very deceiving.,Life is abundant in those lakes,,but like in many places on Earth nright now and due to climate change,,there is a huge loss in biodiversity.,In the samples that we took back home,,36 percent of the bacteria in those lakesnwere composed of three species,,and those three species are the onesnthat have survived so far. 
 Here's another lake,nright next to the first one.,The red color you see herenis not due to minerals.,It's actually due to the presencenof a tiny algae.,In this region, the U.V. radiationnis really nasty.,Anywhere on Earth, 11nis considered to be extreme.,During U.V. storms there,nthe U.V. Index reaches 43.,SPF 30 is not going to do anything nto you over there,,and the water is sontransparent in those lakes,that the algae hasnnowhere to hide, really,,and so they are developingntheir own sunscreen,,and this is the red color you see.,But they can adapt only so far,,and then when all the waternis gone from the surface,,microbes have only one solution left:,They go underground.,And those microbes, the rocksnyou see in that slide here,,well, they are actuallynliving inside rocks,and they are using the protectionnof the translucence of the rocks,to get the good part of the U.V.,and discard the part that couldnactually damage their DNA.,And this is why we are taking our rover,to train them to search nfor life on Mars in these areas,,because if there was life on Marsnthree and a half billion years ago,,it had to use the same strategynto actually protect itself.,Now, it is pretty obvious,that going to extreme environmentsnis helping us very much,for the exploration of Mars nand to prepare missions.,So far, it has helped us to understandnthe geology of Mars.,It has helped to understand the pastnclimate of Mars and its evolution,,but also its habitability potential.,Our most recent rover on Marsnhas discovered traces of organics.,Yeah, there are organicsnat the surface of Mars.,And it also discovered traces of methane.,And we don't know yetnif the methane in question,is really from geology or biology.,Regardless, what we know isnthat because of the discovery,,the hypothesis that there is stillnlife present on Mars today,remains a viable one. 
 So by now, I think I have convinced younthat Mars is very special to us,,but it would be a mistake to thinknthat Mars is the only place,in the solar system that is interestingnto find potential microbial life.,And the reason is becausenMars and the Earth,could have a common rootnto their tree of life,,but when you go beyond Mars,nit's not that easy.,Celestial mechanics nis not making it so easy,for an exchangenof material between planets,,and so if we were to discovernlife on those planets,,it would be different from us.,It would be a different type of life.,But in the end, it might be just us,,it might be us and Mars,,or it can be many trees of lifenin the solar system.,I don't know the answer yet,nbut I can tell you something:,No matter what the result is,nno matter what that magic number is,,it is going to give us a standard,by which we are going to be able nto measure the life potential,,abundance and diversitynbeyond our own solar system.,And this can be achievednby our generation.,This can be our legacy,nbut only if we dare to explore. 
 Now, finally,,if somebody tells you that looking nfor alien microbes is not cool,because you cannot havena philosophical conversation with them,,let me show you why and hownyou can tell them they're wrong.,Well, organic materialnis going to tell you,about environment, about complexitynand about diversity.,DNA, or any information carrier,nis going to tell you about adaptation,,about evolution, about survival,nabout planetary changes,and about the transfer of information.,All together, they are telling us,what started as a microbial pathway,,and why what startednas a microbial pathway,sometimes ends up as a civilization,or sometimes ends up as a dead end. 
 Look at the solar system,nand look at the Earth.,On Earth, there are manynintelligent species,,but only one has achieved technology.,Right here in the journeynof our own solar system,,there is a very, very powerful message,that says here's how we should look nfor alien life, small and big.,So yeah, microbes are talkingnand we are listening,,and they are taking us,,one planet at a timenand one moon at a time,,towards their big brothers out there.,And they are telling us about diversity,,they are telling us aboutnabundance of life,,and they are telling usnhow this life has survived thus far,to reach civilization,,intelligence, technologynand, indeed, philosophy. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a story about capitalism.,It's a system I love,because of the successes and opportunitiesnit's afforded me and millions of others. 
 I started in my 20s trading commodities,ncotton in particular, in the pits,,and if there was ever a free marketnfree-for-all, this was it,,where men wearing ties nbut acting like gladiators,fought literally nand physically for a profit. 
 Fortunately, I was good enoughnthat by the time I was 30,,I was able to move into the upstairs nworld of money management,,where I spent the next three decadesnas a global macro trader.,And over that time, I've seenna lot of crazy things in the markets,,and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.,And unfortunately,,I'm sad to report that right now nwe might be in the grips,of one of the most disastrous,ncertainly of my career,,and one consistent takeaway isnmanias never end well. 
 Now, over the past 50 years,,we as a society have come to viewnour companies and corporations,in a very narrow, almostnmonomaniacal fashion,with regard to how we value them,,and we have putnso much emphasis on profits,,on short-term quarterlynearnings and share prices,,at the exclusion of all else.,It's like we've ripped the humanitynout of our companies.,Now, we don't do that --nconveniently reduce something,to a set of numbers that youncan play with like Lego toys --,we don't do that in our individual life.,We don't treat somebody or value them,based on their monthly income nor their credit score,,but we have this double standard,when it comes to the waynthat we value our businesses,,and you know what?,It's threatening the verynunderpinnings of our society.,And here's how you'll see. 
 This chart is corporate profit marginsngoing back 40 years,as a percentage of revenues,,and you can see that we'renat a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.,Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,,but if you're the other side of that,nand you're the average American worker,,then you can see it's notnsuch a good thing.,["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs.nCEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"] 
 Now, higher profit marginsndo not increase societal wealth.,What they actually do is theynexacerbate income inequality,,and that's not a good thing.,But intuitively, that makes sense, right?,Because if the top 10 percentnof American families,own 90 percent of the stocks,,as they take a greater sharenof corporate profits,,then there's less wealth leftnfor the rest of society. 
 Again, income inequalitynis not a good thing.,This next chart,nmade by The Equality Trust,,shows 21 countries from Austrianto Japan to New Zealand.,On the horizontal axisnis income inequality.,The further to the right you go,nthe greater the income inequality.,On the vertical axisnare nine social and health metrics.,The more you go up that,nthe worse the problems are,,and those metrics include life expectancy,nteenage pregnancy, literacy,,social mobility, just to name a few.,Now, those of you in the audiencenwho are Americans may wonder,,well, where does the United States rank?,Where does it lie on that chart?,And guess what?,We're literally off the chart.,Yes, that's us,,with the greatest income inequality,and the greatest social problems,naccording to those metrics. 
 Now, here's a macro forecastnthat's easy to make,,and that's, that gap betweennthe wealthiest and the poorest,,it will get closed.,History always does it.,It typically happens in one of three ways:,either through revolution,nhigher taxes, or wars.,None of those are on my bucket list.,(Laughter) 
 Now, there's another way to do it,,and that's by increasing justnessnin corporate behavior,,but the way that we'renoperating right now,,that would requirena tremendous change in behavior,,and like an addict trying to kick a habit,,the first step is to acknowledgenthat you have a problem.,And let me just say,nthis profits mania that we're on,is so deeply entrenched,that we don't even realizenhow we're harming society.,Here's a small but startling examplenof exactly how we're doing that:,this chart shows corporate giving,as a percentage of profits, nnot revenues, over the last 30 years.,Juxtapose that to the earlier chartnof corporate profit margins,,and I ask you, does that feel right? 
 In all fairness, when Instarted writing this, I thought,,"Oh wow, what does my company,nwhat does Tudor do?",And I realized we give one percentnof corporate profits,to charity every year.,And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.,When I realized that, I literallynwanted to throw up.,But the point is, this manianis so deeply entrenched,that well-intentioned people like myselfndon't even realize that we're part of it. 
 Now, we're not goingnto change corporate behavior,by simply increasing corporatenphilanthropy or charitable contributions.,And oh, by the way,nwe've since quadrupled that,,but -- (Applause) -- Please.,But we can do it by drivingnmore just behavior.,And one way to do it is actually trusting,the system that got usnhere in the first place,,and that's the free market system.,About a year ago,nsome friends of mine and I,started a not-for-profitncalled Just Capital.,Its mission is very simple:,to help companies and corporations,learn how to operate in a more justnfashion by using the public's input,to define exactly what the criteria arenfor just corporate behavior.,Now, right now, there'snno widely accepted standard,that a company or corporation can follow,nand that's where Just Capital comes in,,because beginning this year and every yearnwe'll be conducting a nationwide survey,of a representative samplenof 20,000 Americans,to find out exactly what they think,are the criteria for justnessnin corporate behavior.,Now, this is a model that's goingnto start in the United States,but can be expandednanywhere around the globe,,and maybe we'll find out,that the most importantnthing for the public,is that we create living wage jobs,nor make healthy products,,or help, not harm, the environment.,At Just Capital, we don't know,nand it's not for us to decide.,We're but messengers,,but we have 100 percent confidence nand faith in the American public,to get it right.,So we'll release the findingsnthis September for the first time,,and then next year, we'll poll again,,and we'll take the additive step this time,of ranking the 1,000nlargest U.S. companies,from number one to number 1,000nand everything in between.,We're calling it the Just Index,,and remember, we're an independentnnot-for-profit with no bias,,and we will be givingnthe American public a voice.,And maybe over time, we'll find outnthat as people come to know,which companies are the most just,,human and economic resourcesnwill be driven towards them,,and they'll become the most prosperous,and help our countrynbe the most prosperous. 
 Now, capitalism has been responsiblenfor every major innovation,that's made this world a more inspiringnand wonderful place to live in.,Capitalism has to be based on justice.,It has to be, and now more than ever,,with economic divisionsngrowing wider every day.,It's estimated that 47 percentnof American workers,can be displaced in the next 20 years.,I'm not against progress.,I want the driverless car and the jet packnjust like everyone else.,But I'm pleading for recognitionnthat with increased wealth and profits,has to come greaterncorporate social responsibility. 
 "If justice is removed," said Adam Smith,nthe father of capitalism,,"the great, the immense fabricnof human society must in a moment,crumble into atoms." 
 Now, when I was young,nand there was a problem,,my mama used to alwaysnsigh and shake her head and say,,"Have mercy, have mercy.",Now's not the time for us,nfor the rest of us to show them mercy.,The time is now for usnto show them fairness,,and we can do that, you and I,,by starting where we work,nin the businesses that we operate in.,And when we put justnessnon par with profits,,we'll get the most wonderful thingnin all the world.,We'll take back our humanity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My colleagues and I are fascinatednby the science of moving dots.,So what are these dots?,Well, it's all of us.,And we're moving in our homes,nin our offices, as we shop and travel,throughout our citiesnand around the world.,And wouldn't it be greatnif we could understand all this movement?,If we could find patterns and meaningnand insight in it.,And luckily for us, we live in a time,where we're incredibly goodnat capturing information about ourselves.,So whether it's throughnsensors or videos, or apps,,we can track our movementnwith incredibly fine detail. 
 So it turns out one of the placesnwhere we have the best data about movement,is sports.,So whether it's basketball or baseball,nor football or the other football,,we're instrumenting our stadiumsnand our players to track their movements,every fraction of a second.,So what we're doingnis turning our athletes into --,you probably guessed it --,moving dots. 
 So we've got mountains of moving dotsnand like most raw data,,it's hard to deal withnand not that interesting.,But there are things that, for example,nbasketball coaches want to know.,And the problem is they can't know themnbecause they'd have to watch every second,of every game, remember it and process it.,And a person can't do that,,but a machine can.,The problem is a machine can't seenthe game with the eye of a coach.,At least they couldn't until now.,So what have we taught the machine to see? 
 So, we started simply.,We taught it things like passes,nshots and rebounds.,Things that most casual fans would know.,And then we moved on to thingsnslightly more complicated.,Events like post-ups,nand pick-and-rolls, and isolations.,And if you don't know them, that's okay.nMost casual players probably do.,Now, we've gotten to a point where today,nthe machine understands complex events,like down screens and wide pins.,Basically things only professionals know.,So we have taught a machine to seenwith the eyes of a coach. 
 So how have we been able to do this?,If I asked a coach to describensomething like a pick-and-roll,,they would give me a description,,and if I encoded that as an algorithm,nit would be terrible.,The pick-and-roll happens to be this dancenin basketball between four players,,two on offense and two on defense.,And here's kind of how it goes.,So there's the guy on offensenwithout the ball,the ball and he goes next to the guynguarding the guy with the ball,,and he kind of stays there,and they both move and stuff happens,nand ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll. 
 (Laughter) 
 So that is also an examplenof a terrible algorithm.,So, if the player who's the interferer --nhe's called the screener --,goes close by, but he doesn't stop,,it's probably not a pick-and-roll.,Or if he does stop,nbut he doesn't stop close enough,,it's probably not a pick-and-roll.,Or, if he does go close bynand he does stop,but they do it under the basket,nit's probably not a pick-and-roll.,Or I could be wrong,nthey could all be pick-and-rolls.,It really depends on the exact timing,nthe distances, the locations,,and that's what makes it hard.,So, luckily, with machine learning,nwe can go beyond our own ability,to describe the things we know. 
 So how does this work?nWell, it's by example.,So we go to the machine and say,n"Good morning, machine.,Here are some pick-and-rolls,nand here are some things that are not.,Please find a way to tell the difference.",And the key to all of this is to findnfeatures that enable it to separate.,So if I was goingnto teach it the difference,between an apple and orange,,I might say, "Why don't younuse color or shape?",And the problem that we're solving is,nwhat are those things?,What are the key features,that let a computer navigatenthe world of moving dots?,So figuring out all these relationshipsnwith relative and absolute location,,distance, timing, velocities --,that's really the key to the sciencenof moving dots, or as we like to call it,,spatiotemporal pattern recognition,nin academic vernacular.,Because the first thing is,nyou have to make it sound hard --,because it is. 
 The key thing is, for NBA coaches,nit's not that they want to know,whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.,It's that they want to knownhow it happened.,And why is it so important to them?nSo here's a little insight.,It turns out in modern basketball,,this pick-and-roll is perhapsnthe most important play.,And knowing how to run it,nand knowing how to defend it,,is basically a key to winningnand losing most games.,So it turns out that this dancenhas a great many variations,and identifying the variationsnis really the thing that matters,,and that's why we need thisnto be really, really good. 
 So, here's an example.,There are two offensivenand two defensive players,,getting ready to donthe pick-and-roll dance.,So the guy with ballncan either take, or he can reject.,His teammate can either roll or pop.,The guy guarding the ballncan either go over or under.,His teammate can either shownor play up to touch, or play soft,and together they canneither switch or blitz,and I didn't knownmost of these things when I started,and it would be lovely if everybody movednaccording to those arrows.,It would make our lives a lot easier,nbut it turns out movement is very messy.,People wiggle a lot and gettingnthese variations identified,with very high accuracy,,both in precision and recall, is tough,because that's what it takes to getna professional coach to believe in you.,And despite all the difficultiesnwith the right spatiotemporal features,we have been able to do that. 
 Coaches trust our ability of our machinento identify these variations.,We're at the point wherenalmost every single contender,for an NBA championship this year,is using our software, which is builtnon a machine that understands,the moving dots of basketball.,So not only that, we have given advicenthat has changed strategies,that have helped teams winnvery important games,,and it's very exciting because you havencoaches who've been in the league,for 30 years that are willing to takenadvice from a machine.,And it's very exciting,nit's much more than the pick-and-roll.,Our computer started outnwith simple things,and learned more and more complex things,and now it knows so many things.,Frankly, I don't understandnmuch of what it does,,and while it's not that specialnto be smarter than me,,we were wondering,ncan a machine know more than a coach?,Can it know more than person could know?,And it turns out the answer is yes. 
 The coaches want playersnto take good shots.,So if I'm standing near the basket,and there's nobody near me,nit's a good shot.,If I'm standing far away surroundednby defenders, that's generally a bad shot.,But we never knew how good "good" was,nor how bad "bad" was quantitatively.,Until now. 
 So what we can do, again,nusing spatiotemporal features,,we looked at every shot.,We can see: Where is the shot?nWhat's the angle to the basket?,Where are the defenders standing?nWhat are their distances?,What are their angles?,For multiple defenders, we can looknat how the player's moving,and predict the shot type.,We can look at all their velocitiesnand we can build a model that predicts,what is the likelihood that this shotnwould go in under these circumstances?,So why is this important?,We can take something that was shooting,,which was one thing before,nand turn it into two things:,the quality of the shotnand the quality of the shooter.,So here's a bubble chart,nbecause what's TED without a bubble chart? 
 (Laughter) 
 Those are NBA players.,The size is the size of the playernand the color is the position.,On the x-axis,nwe have the shot probability.,People on the left take difficult shots,,on the right, they take easy shots.,On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.,People who are good are at the top,nbad at the bottom.,So for example, if there was a player,who generally maden47 percent of their shots,,that's all you knew before.,But today, I can tell you that playerntakes shots that an average NBA player,would make 49 percent of the time,,and they are two percent worse.,And the reason that's importantnis that there are lots of 47s out there.,And so it's really important to know,if the 47 that you're consideringngiving 100 million dollars to,is a good shooter who takes bad shots,or a bad shooter who takes good shots.,Machine understanding doesn't just changenhow we look at players,,it changes how we look at the game. 
 So there was this very exciting gamena couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.,Miami was down by three,nthere was 20 seconds left.,They were about to lose the championship.,A gentleman named LeBron Jamesncame up and he took a three to tie.,He missed.,His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,,passed it to another teammatennamed Ray Allen.,He sank a three. It went into overtime.,They won the game.nThey won the championship.,It was one of the most excitingngames in basketball.,And our ability to knownthe shot probability for every player,at every second,,and the likelihood of them gettingna rebound at every second,can illuminate this moment in a waynthat we never could before.,Now unfortunately,nI can't show you that video.,But for you, we recreated that moment,at our weekly basketball gamenabout 3 weeks ago. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we recreated the trackingnthat led to the insights.,So, here is us.nThis is Chinatown in Los Angeles,,a park we play at every week,,and that's us recreatingnthe Ray Allen moment,and all the trackingnthat's associated with it.,So, here's the shot.,I'm going to show you that moment,and all the insights of that moment.,The only difference is, insteadnof the professional players, it's us,,and instead of a professionalnannouncer, it's me.,So, bear with me. 
 Miami.,Down three.,Twenty seconds left.,Jeff brings up the ball.,Josh catches, puts up a three! 
 [Calculating shot probability] 
 [Shot quality] 
 [Rebound probability] 
 Won't go! 
 [Rebound probability] 
 Rebound, Noel.,Back to Daria. 
 [Shot quality] 
 Her three-pointer -- bang!,Tie game with five seconds left.,The crowd goes wild. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's roughly how it happened. 
 (Applause) 
 Roughly. 
 (Applause),That moment had about a nine percentnchance of happening in the NBA,and we know thatnand a great many other things.,I'm not going to tell you how many timesnit took us to make that happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, I will! It was four. 
 (Laughter) 
 Way to go, Daria. 
 But the important thing about that video,and the insights we have for every secondnof every NBA game -- it's not that.,It's the fact you don't have to bena professional team to track movement.,You do not have to be a professionalnplayer to get insights about movement. 
 In fact, it doesn't even have to be aboutnsports because we're moving everywhere.,We're moving in our homes,,in our offices,,as we shop and we travel,throughout our cities,and around our world.,What will we know? What will we learn?,Perhaps, instead of identifyingnpick-and-rolls,,a machine can identifynthe moment and let me know,when my daughter takes her first steps.,Which could literally be happeningnany second now. 
 Perhaps we can learn to better usenour buildings, better plan our cities.,I believe that with the developmentnof the science of moving dots,,we will move better, we will move smarter,nwe will move forward. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago,nI got a call from a woman in Texas,,Stacey Baker,,and she'd seen some of my photographsnin an art exhibition,and was wondering if she could commissionnme to take a portrait of her parents.,Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey,nand I thought this was some sort of,wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,,but it was only later that I found out,she'd actually taken out a loannto make this happen. 
 I took the picture of her parents,,but I was actually more excitednabout photographing Stacey.,The picture I made that day,ended up becomingnone of my best-known portraits.,At the time I made this picture,nStacey was working as an attorney,for the State of Texas.,Not long after, she left her jobnto study photography in Maine,,and while she was there,nshe ended up meeting,the director of photographynat the New York Times Magazine,and was actually offered a job.,Stacey Baker: In the years since,nAlec and I have done,a number of magazine projects together,,and we've become friends. 
 A few months ago, I started talkingnto Alec about a fascination of mine.,I've always been obsessednwith how couples meet.,I asked Alec how henand his wife Rachel met,,and he told me the storynof a high school football game,where she was 16 and he was 15,,and he asked her out.,He liked her purple hair.,She said yes, and that was it.,I then asked Alec if he'd be interestednin doing a photography project,exploring this question. 
 AS: And I was interested in the question,nbut I was actually much more interested,in Stacey's motivation for asking it,,particularly since I'd never knownnStacey to have a boyfriend.,So as part of this project,nI thought it'd be interesting,if she tried to meet someone.,So my idea was to have Stacey herengo speed dating,in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.,(Laughter) (Applause) (Music) 
 SB: We ended up at what was advertisednas the world's largest speed dating event.,I had 19 dates,and each date lasted three minutes.,Participants were given a list of ice-nbreaker questions to get the ball rolling,,things like, "If you could be any kindnof animal, what would you be?",That sort of thing. 
 My first date was Colin.,He's from England,,and he once married a woman he metnafter placing an ad for a Capricorn.,Alec and I saw himnat the end of the evening,,and he said he'd kissed a woman in linenat one of the concession stands. 
 Zack and Chris camento the date-a-thon together. 
 This is Carl.,I asked Carl, "What's the first thingnyou notice about a woman?",He said, "Tits.",(Laughter) 
 Matthew is attracted to womennwith muscular calves.,We talked about running. He doesntriathlons, I run half-marathons.,Alec actually liked his eyes and askednif I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,,and I don't think he wasnattracted to me either. 
 Austin and Mike came together.,Mike asked me a hypothetical question.,He said, "You're in an elevatornrunning late for a meeting.,Someone makes a dash for the elevator.,Do you hold it open for them?",And I said I would not.,(Laughter) 
 Cliff said the first thing he noticesnabout a woman is her teeth,,and we complimented each other's teeth.,Because he's an open mouth sleeper,,he says he has to floss morento help prevent gum disease,,and so I asked him how often he flosses,,and he said, "Every other day.",(Laughter),Now, as someone who flosses twice a day,,I wasn't really sure thatnthat was flossing more,but I don't think I said that out loud. 
 Bill is an auditor,,and we talked the entire three minutesnabout auditing. (Laughter) 
 The first thing Spencer noticesnabout a woman is her complexion.,He feels a lot of womennwear too much makeup,,and that they should only wear enoughnto accentuate the features that they have.,I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all,and he seemed to thinknthat that was a good thing.,Craig told me he didn't thinknI was willing to be vulnerable.,He was also frustrated when I couldn'tnremember my most embarrassing moment.,He thought I was lying, but I wasn't.,I didn't think he liked me at all,nbut at the end of the night,,he came back to me and he gave mena box of chocolates. 
 William was really difficult to talk to.,I think he was drunk.,(Laughter) 
 Actor Chris McKennanwas the MC of the event.,He used to be onn"The Young and the Restless.",I didn't actually go on a date with him.,Alec said he saw several womenngive their phone numbers to him. 
 Needless to say, I didn't fall in love.,I didn't feel a particular connection withnany of the men that I went on dates with,,and I didn't feel like they feltna particular connection with me either. 
 AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --,(Laughter) -- as a photographernis the quality of vulnerability.,The physical exterior reveals a cracknin which you can get a glimpse,at a more fragile interior.,At this date-a-thon event,nI saw so many examples of that,,but as I watched Stacey's datesnand talked to her about them,,I realized how differentnphotographic love is from real love. 
 What is real love? How does it work?,In order to work on this questionnand to figure out how someone goes,from meeting on a datento having a life together,,Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,,which is the largestnretirement community in Las Vegas.,Our contact there was George,nwho runs the community's photography club.,He arranged for us to meet other couplesnin their makeshift photo studio.,SB: After 45 years of marriage,nAnastasia's husband died two years ago, 
 so we asked if she hadnan old wedding picture.,She met her husbandnwhen she was a 15-year-old waitress,at a small barbecue place in Michigan.,He was 30.,She'd lied about her age.,He was the first person she'd dated. 
 Dean had been named photographer ofnthe year in Las Vegas two years in a row,,and this caught Alec's attention,,as did the fact nthat he met his wife, Judy,,at the same age when Alec met Rachel.,Dean admitted that he likesnto look at beautiful women,,but he's never questionednhis decision to marry Judy. 
 AS: George met Josephinenat a parish dance.,He was 18, she was 15.,Like a lot of the couples we met,nthey weren't especially philosophical,about their early choices.,George said somethingnthat really stuck with me.,He said, "When you get that feeling,nyou just go with it." 
 Bob and Trudy met on a blind datenwhen she was still in high school.,They said they weren't particularlynattracted to each other,when the first met.,Nevertheless, they werenmarried soon after. 
 SB: The story that stayed with me the most,was that of George, the photography clubnpresident, and his wife, Mary.,This was George and Mary'snsecond marriage.,They met at a country-western clubnin Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.,He was there alone drinkingnand she was with friends.,When they started dating,nhe owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,,and she offered to help himnget out of debt,,so for the next year, he turnednhis paychecks over to Mary,,and she got him out of debt.,George was actually an alcoholicnwhen they married, and Mary knew it.,At some point in their marriage,nhe says he consumed,54 beers in one day.,Another time, when he was drunk,nhe threatened to kill Mary,and her two kids,,but they escaped and a SWAT teamnwas called to the house.,Amazingly, Mary took him back,,and eventually things got better.,George has been involvednin Alcoholics Anonymous,and hasn't had a drink in 36 years. 
 (Music) 
 At the end of the day,nafter we left Sun City,,I told Alec that I didn't actually think,that the stories of how these couples metnwere all that interesting.,What was more interesting,was how they managed to stay together. 
 AS: They all had this beautifulnquality of endurance,,but that was true of the singles, too.,The world is hard,nand the singles were out there,trying to connect with other people,,and the couplesnwere holding onto each other,after all these decades. 
 My favorite pictures on this tripnwere of Joe and Roseanne.,Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,,we'd gotten in the habit of asking couplesnif they had an old wedding photograph.,In their case, they simultaneouslynpulled out of their wallets,the exact same photograph.,What's more beautiful,nI thought to myself,,this image of a young couplenwho has just fallen in love,or the idea of these two peoplenholding onto this image for decades? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 These bees are in my backyardnin Berkeley, California.,Until last year,nI'd never kept bees before,,but National Geographic asked mento photograph a story about them,,and I decided, to be ablento take compelling images,,I should start keeping bees myself.,And as you may know,,bees pollinate one thirdnof our food crops,,and lately they've been havingna really hard time.,So as a photographer, I wanted to explorenwhat this problem really looks like.,So I'm going to show younwhat I found over the last year. 
 This furry little creature,is a fresh young bee halfway emergednfrom its brood cell,,and bees right now are dealingnwith several different problems,,including pesticides, diseases,nand habitat loss,,but the single greatest threatnis a parasitic mite from Asia,,Varroa destructor.,And this pinhead-sized mitencrawls onto young bees,and sucks their blood.,This eventually destroys a hive,because it weakensnthe immune system of the bees,,and it makes them more vulnerablento stress and disease. 
 Now, bees are the most sensitive,when they're developingninside their brood cells,,and I wanted to knownwhat that process really looks like,,so I teamed upnwith a bee lab at U.C. Davis,and figured out how to raise beesnin front of a camera.,I'm going to show younthe first 21 days of a bee's life,condensed into 60 seconds. 
 This is a bee eggnas it hatches into a larva,,and those newly hatched larvaenswim around their cells,feeding on this white goonthat nurse bees secrete for them.,Then, their head and their legsnslowly differentiate,as they transform into pupae.,Here's that same pupation process,,and you can actually see the mitesnrunning around in the cells.,Then the tissue in their body reorganizes,and the pigment slowlyndevelops in their eyes.,The last step of the processnis their skin shrivels up,and they sprout hair.,(Music) 
 So -- (Applause) 
 As you can see halfwaynthrough that video,,the mites were running aroundnon the baby bees,,and the way that beekeepersntypically manage these mites,is they treat their hives with chemicals.,In the long run, that's bad news,,so researchers are workingnon finding alternatives,to control these mites. 
 This is one of those alternatives.,It's an experimental breeding programnat the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,,and this queen and her attendant beesnare part of that program. 
 Now, the researchers figured out,that some of the bees havena natural ability to fight mites,,so they set out to breedna line of mite-resistant bees.,This is what it takesnto breed bees in a lab.,The virgin queen is sedated,and then artificially inseminatednusing this precision instrument.,Now, this procedure allows the researchers,to control exactlynwhich bees are being crossed,,but there's a tradeoffnin having this much control.,They succeeded in breedingnmite-resistant bees,,but in that process, those beesnstarted to lose traits,like their gentlenessnand their ability to store honey,,so to overcome that problem,,these researchers are now collaboratingnwith commercial beekeepers.,This is Bret Adee openingnone of his 72,000 beehives.,He and his brother run the largestnbeekeeping operation in the world,,and the USDA is integrating theirnmite-resistant bees into his operation,with the hope that over time,,they'll be able to select the beesnthat are not only mite-resistant,but also retain all of these qualitiesnthat make them useful to us. 
 And to say it like that,makes it sound like we're manipulatingnand exploiting bees,,and the truth is, we've been doing thatnfor thousands of years.,We took this wild creaturenand put it inside of a box,,practically domesticating it,,and originally that wasnso that we could harvest their honey,,but over time we started losingnour native pollinators,,our wild pollinators,,and there are many places nownwhere those wild pollinators,can no longer meet the pollinationndemands of our agriculture,,so these managed bees have becomenan integral part of our food system. 
 So when people talk about saving bees,,my interpretation of that,is we need to savenour relationship to bees,,and in order to design new solutions,,we have to understandnthe basic biology of bees,and understand the effectsnof stressors that we sometimes cannot see.,In other words, we havento understand bees up close. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was a kid,,the disaster we worried about most nwas a nuclear war.,That's why we had a barrel like thisndown in our basement,,filled with cans of food and water.,When the nuclear attack came,,we were supposed to go downstairs,nhunker down, and eat out of that barrel. 
 Today the greatest risk nof global catastrophe,doesn't look like this.,Instead, it looks like this.,If anything kills over 10 million peoplenin the next few decades,,it's most likely to be na highly infectious virus,rather than a war.,Not missiles, but microbes.,Now, part of the reason for this is that,we've invested a huge amountnin nuclear deterrents.,But we've actually invested very little nin a system to stop an epidemic.,We're not ready for the next epidemic. 
 Let's look at Ebola.,I'm sure all of you read about it nin the newspaper,,lots of tough challenges.,I followed it carefully nthrough the case analysis tools,we use to track polio eradication.,And as you look at what went on,,the problem wasn't that there was a systemnthat didn't work well enough,,the problem was that we ndidn't have a system at all.,In fact, there's some pretty obviousnkey missing pieces. 
 We didn't have a group of epidemiologists nready to go, who would have gone,,seen what the disease was,nseen how far it had spread.,The case reports came in on paper.,It was very delayednbefore they were put online,and they were extremely inaccurate.,We didn't have a medical team ready to go.,We didn't have a way of preparing people.,Now, Médecins Sans Frontières ndid a great job orchestrating volunteers.,But even so, we were far slowernthan we should have been,getting the thousands of workersninto these countries.,And a large epidemic would require usnto have hundreds of thousands of workers.,There was no one there nto look at treatment approaches.,No one to look at the diagnostics.,No one to figure out nwhat tools should be used.,As an example, we could have ntaken the blood of survivors,,processed it, and put that plasmanback in people to protect them.,But that was never tried. 
 So there was a lot that was missing.,And these things nare really a global failure.,The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,nbut not to do these things I talked about.,Now, in the movies it's quite different.,There's a group of handsomenepidemiologists ready to go,,they move in, they save the day,nbut that's just pure Hollywood. 
 The failure to prepare ncould allow the next epidemic,to be dramatically nmore devastating than Ebola,Let's look at the progression nof Ebola over this year.,About 10,000 people died,,and nearly all were in the threenWest African countries.,There's three reasons whynit didn't spread more.,The first is that there was a lot nof heroic work by the health workers.,They found the people and they nprevented more infections.,The second is the nature of the virus.,Ebola does not spread through the air.,And by the time you're contagious,,most people are so sick nthat they're bedridden.,Third, it didn't getninto many urban areas.,And that was just luck.,If it had gotten into a lot nmore urban areas,,the case numbers nwould have been much larger. 
 So next time, we might not be so lucky.,You can have a virus where people nfeel well enough while they're infectious,that they get on a planenor they go to a market.,The source of the virus could be na natural epidemic like Ebola,,or it could be bioterrorism.,So there are things that would literallynmake things a thousand times worse. 
 In fact, let's look at a modelnof a virus spread through the air,,like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.,So here's what would happen:,It would spread throughout the worldnvery, very quickly.,And you can see over 30 million peoplendied from that epidemic.,So this is a serious problem.,We should be concerned. 
 But in fact, we can buildna really good response system.,We have the benefits of all the sciencenand technology that we talk about here.,We've got cell phones,to get information from the public nand get information out to them.,We have satellite maps where we can seenwhere people are and where they're moving.,We have advances in biology,that should dramatically change nthe turnaround time to look at a pathogen,and be able to make drugs and vaccinesnthat fit for that pathogen.,So we can have tools,,but those tools need to be putninto an overall global health system.,And we need preparedness. 
 The best lessons, I think, non how to get prepared,are again, what we do for war.,For soldiers, we have full-time,nwaiting to go.,We have reserves that can scale nus up to large numbers.,NATO has a mobile unit nthat can deploy very rapidly.,NATO does a lot of war games nto check, are people well trained?,Do they understand nabout fuel and logistics,and the same radio frequencies?,So they are absolutely ready to go.,So those are the kinds of thingsnwe need to deal with an epidemic. 
 What are the key pieces?,First, we need strong health systemsnin poor countries.,That's where mothers ncan give birth safely,,kids can get all their vaccines.,But, also where we'll see nthe outbreak very early on.,We need a medical reserve corps:,lots of people who've got nthe training and background,who are ready to go, with the expertise.,And then we need to pair thosenmedical people with the military.,taking advantage of the military's abilitynto move fast, do logistics,and secure areas.,We need to do simulations,,germ games, not war games,nso that we see where the holes are.,The last time a germ game nwas done in the United States,was back in 2001, nand it didn't go so well.,So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.,Finally, we need lots of advanced R&Dnin areas of vaccines and diagnostics.,There are some big breakthroughs, nlike the Adeno-associated virus,,that could work very, very quickly. 
 Now I don't have an exact budgetnfor what this would cost,,but I'm quite sure it's very modestncompared to the potential harm.,The World Bank estimates that nif we have a worldwide flu epidemic,,global wealth will go downnby over three trillion dollars,and we'd have millionsnand millions of deaths.,These investments noffer significant benefits,beyond just being ready for the epidemic.,The primary healthcare, the R&D,,those things would reduce nglobal health equity,and make the world more just nas well as more safe. 
 So I think this should absolutelynbe a priority.,There's no need to panic.,We don't have to hoard cans of spaghettinor go down into the basement.,But we need to get going,nbecause time is not on our side. 
 In fact, if there's one positive thingnthat can come out of the Ebola epidemic,,it's that it can serve as an early nwarning, a wake-up call, to get ready.,If we start now, we can be ready nfor the next epidemic. 
 Thank you.

 Yeah, yeah!Virtual reality started for menin sort of an unusual place.,It was the 1970s.,I got into the field very young:nI was seven years old.,And the tool that I used nto access virtual reality,was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.,This is a commercial for nthat particular item:,(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!,Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.,That gyro-power sends him nover 100 feet at top speed. 
 Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.,I rode this motorcycle everywhere.,And I was there with Evel Knievel; we njumped the Snake River Canyon together.,I wanted the rocket.,I never got the rocket,nI only got the motorcycle.,I felt so connected to this world.,I didn't want to be a storyteller nwhen I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.,I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.,I had so much empathy for him. 
 But it didn't work out. (Laughter),I went to art school.,I started making music videos.,And this is one of the earlynmusic videos that I made:,(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West),CM: You may notice nsome slight similarities here.,(Laughter),And I got that rocket.,(Laughter) 
 So, now I'm a filmmaker,nor, the beginning of a filmmaker,,and I started using the tools that arenavailable to me as a filmmaker,to try to tell the most compelling storiesnthat I can to an audience.,And film is this incredible mediumnthat allows us to feel empathy,for people that are very different than us,and worlds completely nforeign from our own. 
 Unfortunately,,Evel Knievel did not feel the same nempathy for us that we felt for him,,and he sued us for this video --,(Laughter) --,shortly thereafter.,On the upside, the man nthat I worshipped as a child,,the man that I wanted nto become as an adult,,I was finally able to get his autograph.,(Applause) 
 Let's talk about film now.,Film, it's an incredible medium,,but essentially, it's the samennow as it was then.,It's a group of rectangles that arenplayed in a sequence.,And we've done incredible thingsnwith those rectangles.,But I started thinking about,,is there a way that I can use modernnand developing technologies,to tell stories in different ways,and tell different kinds of stories,that maybe I couldn't tell usingnthe traditional tools of filmmaking,that we've been using for 100 years?,So I started experimenting,,and what I was trying to do wasnto build the ultimate empathy machine.,And here's one of the early experiments:,(Music) 
 So this is calledn"The Wilderness Downtown.",It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.,It asked you to put in the addressnwhere you grew up at the beginning of it.,It's a website.,And out of it starts growing these littlenboxes with different browser windows.,And you see this teenager nrunning down a street,,and then you see Google Street Viewnand Google Maps imagery,and you realize the streetnhe's running down is yours.,And when he stops in front of a house,nhe stops in front of your house.,And this was great, and I saw people nhaving an even deeper emotional reaction,to this than the things that nI had made in rectangles.,And I'm essentially taking na piece of your history,and putting it inside nthe framing of the story. 
 But then I started thinking,,okay, well that's a part of you,,but how do I put all of youninside of the frame?,So to do that, I startednmaking art installations.,And this is one called n"The Treachery of Sanctuary.",It's a triptych. I'm going to shownyou the third panel.,(Music),So now I've got you inside of the frame,,and I saw people having even morenvisceral emotional reactions,to this work than the previous one. 
 But then I started thinking about frames,nand what do they represent?,And a frame is just a window.,I mean, all the media that we watch --ntelevision, cinema --,they're these windows into nthese other worlds.,And I thought, well, great. nI got you in a frame.,But I don't want you in the frame,nI don't want you in the window,,I want you through the window,nI want you on the other side,,in the world, inhabiting the world. 
 So that leads me back to virtual reality.,Let's talk about virtual reality.,Unfortunately,,talking about virtual realitynis like dancing about architecture.,And this is actually someone dancingnabout architecture in virtual reality.,(Laughter),So, it's difficult to explain.nWhy is it difficult to explain?,It's difficult because it's a very nexperiential medium.,You feel your way inside of it.,It's a machine, but inside of it,,it feels like real life,nit feels like truth.,And you feel present in the worldnthat you're inside,and you feel present with the peoplenthat you're inside of it with. 
 So, I'm going to show you a demonof a virtual reality film:,a full-screen version ofnall the information,that we capture whennwe shoot virtual reality.,So we're shooting in every direction.,This is a camera system that we built,that has 3D cameras that looknin every direction,and binaural microphonesnthat face in every direction.,We take this and we build, basically,na sphere of a world that you inhabit.,So what I'm going to show younis not a view into the world,,it's basically the whole worldnstretched into a rectangle.,So this film is called n"Clouds Over Sidra,",and it was made in conjunction with nour virtual reality company called VRSE,and the United Nations,,and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.,And we went to a Syrian refugee campnin Jordan in December,and shot the story of a 12-year-oldngirl there named Sidra.,And she and her family fled Syrianthrough the desert into Jordan,and she's been living in thisncamp for the last year and a half. 
 (Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.,I am 12 years old.,I am in the fifth grade.,I am from Syria,nin the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.,I have lived here in the Zaatari campnin Jordan for the last year and a half.,I have a big family:,three brothers, one is a baby.,He cries a lot.,I asked my father if I cried when nI was a baby and he says I did not.,I think I was a stronger babynthan my brother. 
 CM: So, when you're inside nof the headset.,you're not seeing it like this.,You're looking around through this world.,You'll notice you see fulln360 degrees, in all directions.,And when you're sitting therenin her room, watching her,,you're not watching it throughna television screen,,you're not watching it through a window,nyou're sitting there with her.,When you look down, you're sittingnon the same ground that she's sitting on.,And because of that,,you feel her humanity in a deeper way.,You empathize with her in a deeper way. 
 And I think that we can changenminds with this machine.,And we've already startednto try to change a few.,So we took this film to the World EconomicnForum in Davos in January.,And we showed it to a group of people,whose decisions affect the livesnof millions of people.,And these are people nwho might not otherwise,be sitting in a tent nin a refugee camp in Jordan.,But in January, one afternoonnin Switzerland,,they suddenly all found themselves there.,(Applause),And they were affected by it. 
 So we're going to make more of them.,We're working with the nUnited Nations right now,to shoot a whole series of these films.,We just finished shootingna story in Liberia.,And now, we're going nto shoot a story in India.,And we're taking these films,,and we're showing them nat the United Nations,to people that work there and peoplenthat are visiting there.,And we're showing nthem to the people,that can actually change the livesnof the people inside of the films. 
 And that's where I think we justnstart to scratch the surface,of the true power of virtual reality.,It's not a video game peripheral.,It connects humans to other humansnin a profound way,that I've never seen before nin any other form of media.,And it can change people'snperception of each other.,And that's how I think,virtual reality has the potentialnto actually change the world. 
 So, it's a machine,,but through this machinenwe become more compassionate,,we become more empathetic,nand we become more connected.,And ultimately, we become more human. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I wrote my memoir,,the publishers were really confused.,Was it about me as a child refugee,,or as a woman who set up a high-technsoftware company back in the 1960s,,one that went public,and eventually employed over 8,500 people?,Or was it as a mothernof an autistic child?,Or as a philanthropist that'snnow given away serious money?,Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.,So let me tell you my story. 
 All that I am stems from whennI got onto a train in Vienna,,part of the Kindertransport that savednnearly 10,000 Jewish children,from Nazi Europe.,I was five years old, clutching the handnof my nine-year-old sister,and had very little idea as to nwhat was going on.,"What is England and nwhy am I going there?",I'm only alive because so long ago, nI was helped by generous strangers.,I was lucky, and doubly luckynto be later reunited,with my birth parents.,But, sadly, I never bonded nwith them again.,But I've done more in the seven decadesnsince that miserable day,when my mother put me on the train,than I would ever have dreamed possible.,And I love England, my adopted country,,with a passion that perhaps only someonenwho has lost their human rights can feel.,I decided to make mine a lifenthat was worth saving.,And then, I just got on with it.,(Laughter) 
 Let me take you back to the early 1960s.,To get past the gender issues of the time,,I set up my own software house at onenof the first such startups in Britain.,But it was also a company of women,na company for women,,an early social business.,And people laughed at the very ideanbecause software, at that time,,was given away free with hardware.,Nobody would buy software,ncertainly not from a woman.,Although women were then coming outnof the universities with decent degrees,,there was a glass ceiling to our progress.,And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,,and I wanted opportunities for women. 
 I recruited professionally qualified womennwho'd left the industry on marriage,,or when their first child was expected,and structured them into anhome-working organization.,We pioneered the concept of womenngoing back into the workforce,after a career break.,We pioneered all sorts ofnnew, flexible work methods:,job shares, profit-sharing, nand eventually, co-ownership,when I took a quarter of the companyninto the hands of the staff,at no cost to anyone but me.,For years, I was the first woman this,nor the only woman that.,And in those days, I couldn't worknon the stock exchange,,I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.,Indeed, I couldn't open a bank accountnwithout my husband's permission.,My generation of women foughtnthe battles for the right to work,and the right for equal pay. 
 Nobody really expected much nfrom people at work or in society,because all the expectations then,were about home and nfamily responsibilities.,And I couldn't really face that,,so I started to challengenthe conventions of the time,,even to the extent of changing my namenfrom "Stephanie" to "Steve",in my business development letters,,so as to get through the doornbefore anyone realized,that he was a she.,(Laughter) 
 My company, called Freelance Programmers,nand that's precisely what it was,,couldn't have started smaller: non the dining room table,,and financed by the equivalentnof 100 dollars in today's terms,,and financed by my labor and nby borrowing against the house.,My interests were scientific, nthe market was commercial --,things such as payroll,nwhich I found rather boring.,So I had to compromise with noperational research work,,which had the intellectual challenge nthat interested me,and the commercial value nthat was valued by the clients:,things like scheduling freight trains,,time-tabling buses, stock control,nlots and lots of stock control.,And eventually, the work came in.,We disguised the domestic andnpart-time nature of the staff,by offering fixed prices,none of the very first to do so.,And who would have guessednthat the programming,of the black box flight recorder nof Supersonic Concord,would have been done by a bunch nof women working in their own homes.,(Applause) 
 All we used was a simple n"trust the staff" approach,and a simple telephone.,We even used to ask job applicants, n"Do you have access to a telephone?" 
 An early project was to developnsoftware standards,on management control protocols.,And software was and still is anmaddeningly hard-to-control activity,,so that was enormously valuable.,We used the standards ourselves,,we were even paid to update nthem over the years,,and eventually, they were adopted by NATO.,Our programmers -- remember, only women,,including gay and transgender --,worked with pencil and papernto develop flowcharts,defining each task to be done.,And they then wrote code, nusually machine code,,sometimes binary code,,which was then sentnby mail to a data center,to be punched ontonpaper tape or card,and then re-punched, nin order to verify it.,All this, before it ever gotnnear a computer.,That was programming in the early 1960s. 
 In 1975, 13 years from startup,,equal opportunity legislation ncame in in Britain,and that made it illegal to have nour pro-female policies.,And as an example of nunintended consequences,,my female company had to let the men in.,(Laughter) 
 When I started my company of women,,the men said, "How interesting, becausenit only works because it's small.",And later, as it became sizable, nthey accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,,but of no strategic interest.",And later, when it was a companynvalued at over three billion dollars,,and I'd made 70 of the staff ninto millionaires,,they sort of said, "Well done, Steve!",(Laughter),(Applause) 
 You can always tell ambitious womennby the shape of our heads:,They're flat on top for being npatted patronizingly.,(Laughter) (Applause),And we have larger feet to standnaway from the kitchen sink.,(Laughter) 
 Let me share with you ntwo secrets of success:,Surround yourself with first-class peoplenand people that you like;,and choose your partnernvery, very carefully.,Because the other day when I said, n"My husband's an angel,",a woman complained --n"You're lucky," she said,,"mine's still alive.",(Laughter) 
 If success were easy, nwe'd all be millionaires.,But in my case, it came in the midstnof family trauma and indeed, crisis.,Our late son, Giles, was an only child,na beautiful, contented baby.,And then, at two and a half,,like a changeling in a fairy story,,he lost the little speech that he had,and turned into a wild, nunmanageable toddler.,Not the terrible twos;,he was profoundly autistic nand he never spoke again.,Giles was the first resident in the firstnhouse of the first charity that I set up,to pioneer services for autism.,And then there's beenna groundbreaking Prior's Court school,for pupils with autism,and a medical research charity,nagain, all for autism.,Because whenever I found a gapnin services, I tried to help.,I like doing new things nand making new things happen.,And I've just started a three-year nthink tank for autism. 
 And so that some of my wealth does go backnto the industry from which it stems,,I've also founded nthe Oxford Internet Institute,and other IT ventures.,The Oxford Internet Institutenfocuses not on the technology,,but on the social, economic, legalnand ethical issues of the Internet. 
 Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.,And I have learned to live without him,,and I have learned to live nwithout his need of me.,Philanthropy is all that I do now.,I need never worry about getting lost,because several charitiesnwould quickly come and find me.,(Laughter) 
 It's one thing to have an idea nfor an enterprise,,but as many people in this room will know,,making it happen is a very difficult thing,and it demands extraordinary energy,nself-belief and determination,,the courage to risk family and home,,and a 24/7 commitment nthat borders on the obsessive.,So it's just as wellnthat I'm a workaholic.,I believe in the beauty of work when wendo it properly and in humility.,Work is not just something I donwhen I'd rather be doing something else. 
 We live our lives forward.,So what has all that taught me?,I learned that tomorrow's nnever going to be like today,,and certainly nothing like yesterday.,And that made me able to cope with change,,indeed, eventually to welcome change,,though I'm told I'm still very difficult. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)In June of 1998,,Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head,nNorth Carolina for France. 
 That's her boat, the American Pearl.,It's 23 feet long and just six feet across,at its widest point.,The deck was the size of a cargo bednof a Ford F-150 pickup truck.,Tori and her friends built it by hand,,and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.,Her plan was to row it alone,across the Atlantic Ocean --,no motor, no sail --,something no woman and no Americannhad ever done before.,This would be her route:,over 3,600 miles acrossnthe open North Atlantic Ocean. 
 Professionally, Tori workednas a project administrator,for the city of Louisville, Kentucky,,her hometown,,but her real passion was exploring.,This was not her first big expedition.,Several years earlier, she'd becomenthe first woman to ski to the South Pole.,She was an accomplished rower in college,,even competed for a spotnon the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,,but this, this was different. 
 (Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure:nHi. It's Sunday, July 5.,Sector time 9 a.m.,So that's Kentucky time now. 
 Dawn Landes: Tori madenthese videos as she rowed.,This is her 21st day at sea.,At this point, she'd coverednover 1,000 miles,,had had no radio contactnin more than two weeks,following a storm that disablednall her long-range communications systems,just five days in.,Most days looked like this.,At this point, she'd rowednover 200,000 strokes,,fighting the current and the wind.,Some days, she travelednas little as 15 feet.,Yeah.,And as frustrating as those days were,,other days were like this. 
 (Video) TMM: And I want to show younmy little friends. 
 DL: She saw fish, dolphins,,whales, sharks,,and even some sea turtles.,After two weeks with no human contact,,Tori was able to contactna local cargo ship,via VHF radio. 
 (Video) TMM: Do you guysnhave a weather report, over? 
 Man: Heading up to a low,ahead of you but it's heading,,and you're obviously going northeast,and there's a high behind us.,That'd be coming,east-northeast also. 
 TMM: Good. 
 DL: She's pretty happy to talknto another human at this point. 
 (Video) TMM: So weather reportnsays nothing dramatic,is going to happen soon. 
 DL: What the weather reportndidn't tell her,was that she was rowing right intonthe path of Hurricane Danielle,in the worst hurricane seasonnon record in the North Atlantic. 
 (Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.,There's a very strong windnfrom the east now.,It's blowing about.,It's blowing!,After 12 days of storm,I get to row for four hours,without a flagging wind.,I'm not very happy right now.,As happy as I was this morning,,I am unhappy now, so ... 
 DL: After nearly three months at sea,,she'd covered over 3,000 miles.,She was two thirds of the way there,,but in the storm, the waves werenthe size of a seven-story building.,Her boat kept capsizing.,Some of them were pitchpole capsizes,nflipping her end over end,,and rowing became impossible. 
 (Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.,I'm in something big, bad and ugly.,Two capsizes.,Last capsize, I took the ribnoff the top of my ceiling with my back.,I've had about six capsizes now.,The last one was a pitchpole.,I have the Argus beacon with me.,I would set off the distress signal,,but quite frankly, I don't think they'dnever be able to find this little boat.,It's so far underwater right now,,the only part that's showingnpretty much is the cabin.,It's about 10 a.m.,I've lost track of the number of capsizes.,I seem to capsize aboutnevery 15 minutes.,I think I may have broken my left arm.,The waves,are tearing the boat to shreds.,I keep praying because,I'm not sure I'm goingnto make it through this.,DL: Tori set off her distress beacon,and was rescuednby a passing container ship.,They found her abandoned boatntwo months later adrift near France.,I read about it in the newspaper. 
 In 1998, I was a high school studentnliving in Louisville, Kentucky.,Now, I live in New York City.nI'm a songwriter.,And her bravery stuck with me,nand I'm adapting her story,into a musical called "Row.",When Tori returned home,,she was feeling disheartened,,she was broke.,She was having a hard timenmaking the transition,back into civilization. 
 In this scene, she sits at home.,The phone is ringing,nher friends are calling,,but she doesn't know how to talk to them.,She sings this song.nIt's called "Dear Heart." 
 (Guitar) 
 When I was dreaming, 
 I took my body 
 to beautiful places 
 I'd never been. 
 I saw Gibraltar, 
 and stars of Kentucky 
 burned in the moonlight, 
 making me smile. 
 And when I awoke here, 
 the sky was so cloudy. 
 I walked to a party 
 where people I know 
 try hard to know me 
 and ask where I've been, 
 but I can't explain 
 what I've seen to them. 
 Ah, listen, dear heart. 
 Just pay attention, 
 go right from the start. 
 Ah, listen, dear heart. 
 You can fall off the map, 
 but don't fall apart. 
 Ooh ooh ooh, 
 ah ah ah ah ah. 
 Ah ah, 
 ah ah ah. 
 When I was out there, 
 the ocean would hold me, 
 rock me and throw me, 
 light as a child. 
 But now I'm so heavy, 
 nothing consoles me. 
 My mind floats like driftwood, 
 wayward and wild. 
 Ah, listen, dear heart. 
 Just pay attention, 
 go right from the start. 
 Ah, listen, dear heart. 
 You can fall off the map, 
 but don't fall apart. 
 Ooh. 
 Eventually, Tori starts to getnher feet under her.,She starts hanging outnwith her friends again.,She meets a guy and fallsnin love for the first time.,She gets a new job workingnfor another Louisville native,,Muhammad Ali.,One day, at lunch with her new boss,,Tori shares the newsnthat two other women,are setting out to rownacross the mid-Atlantic,,to do something that shenalmost died trying to do. 
 His response was classic Ali:,"You don't want to go through life,as the woman who almostnrowed across the ocean." 
 He was right.,Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,,and in December of 1999,,she did it. 
 (Applause)n(Guitar) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I love a great mystery,,and I'm fascinated by the greatestnunsolved mystery in science,,perhaps because it's personal.,It's about who we are,,and I can't help but be curious. 
 The mystery is this:,What is the relationshipnbetween your brain,and your conscious experiences,,such as your experiencenof the taste of chocolate,or the feeling of velvet? 
 Now, this mystery is not new.,In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,,"How it is that anything so remarkablenas a state of consciousness comes about,as the result of irritating nervous tissue,is just as unaccountable,as the appearance of the genienwhen Aladdin rubbed his lamp.",Now, Huxley knew that brain activity,and conscious experiences are correlated,,but he didn't know why.,To the science of his day,nit was a mystery.,In the years since Huxley,,science has learned a lotnabout brain activity,,but the relationshipnbetween brain activity,and conscious experiencesnis still a mystery.,Why? Why have we made so little progress?,Well, some experts thinknthat we can't solve this problem,because we lack the necessarynconcepts and intelligence.,We don't expect monkeys to solvenproblems in quantum mechanics,,and as it happens, we can't expectnour species to solve this problem either.,Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.,I think we've simplynmade a false assumption.,Once we fix it, we justnmight solve this problem.,Today, I'd like tell younwhat that assumption is,,why it's false, and how to fix it. 
 Let's begin with a question:,Do we see reality as it is?,I open my eyes,and I have an experience that I describenas a red tomato a meter away.,As a result, I come to believenthat in reality,,there's a red tomato a meter away.,I then close my eyes, and my experiencenchanges to a gray field,,but is it still the case that in reality,nthere's a red tomato a meter away?,I think so, but could I be wrong?,Could I be misinterpretingnthe nature of my perceptions? 
 We have misinterpretednour perceptions before.,We used to think the Earth is flat,nbecause it looks that way.,Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.,Then we thought that the Earthnis the unmoving center of the Universe,,again because it looks that way.,Copernicus and Galileo discovered,nagain, that we were wrong. 
 Galileo then wondered if we mightnbe misinterpreting our experiences,in other ways.,He wrote: "I think that tastes,nodors, colors, and so on,reside in consciousness.,Hence if the living creature were removed,nall these qualities would be annihilated." 
 Now, that's a stunning claim.,Could Galileo be right?,Could we really be misinterpretingnour experiences that badly?,What does modern sciencenhave to say about this? 
 Well, neuroscientists tell usnthat about a third of the brain's cortex,is engaged in vision.,When you simply open your eyesnand look about this room,,billions of neuronsnand trillions of synapses are engaged. 
 Now, this is a bit surprising,,because to the extent thatnwe think about vision at all,,we think of it as like a camera.,It just takes a picturenof objective reality as it is.,Now, there is a part of visionnthat's like a camera:,the eye has a lens that focusesnan image on the back of the eye,where there are 130 millionnphotoreceptors,,so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.,But that doesn't explainnthe billions of neurons,and trillions of synapsesnthat are engaged in vision.,What are these neurons up to? 
 Well, neuroscientists tell usnthat they are creating, in real time,,all the shapes, objects, colors,nand motions that we see.,It feels like we're just taking a snapshotnof this room the way it is,,but in fact, we're constructingneverything that we see.,We don't constructnthe whole world at once.,We construct what we need in the moment. 
 Now, there are many demonstrationsnthat are quite compelling,that we construct what we see.,I'll just show you two.,In this example, you see some red discsnwith bits cut out of them,,but if I just rotatenthe disks a little bit,,suddenly, you see a 3D cubenpop out of the screen.,Now, the screen of course is flat,,so the three-dimensional cubenthat you're experiencing,must be your construction. 
 In this next example,,you see glowing blue barsnwith pretty sharp edges,moving across a field of dots.,In fact, no dots move.,All I'm doing from frame to framenis changing the colors of dots,from blue to black or black to blue.,But when I do this quickly,,your visual system createsnthe glowing blue bars,with the sharp edges and the motion.,There are many more examples,nbut these are just two,that you construct what you see. 
 But neuroscientists go further.,They say that we reconstruct reality.,So, when I have an experiencenthat I describe as a red tomato,,that experience is actuallynan accurate reconstruction,of the properties of a real red tomato,that would existneven if I weren't looking. 
 Now, why would neuroscientistsnsay that we don't just construct,,we reconstruct?,Well, the standard argument given,is usually an evolutionary one.,Those of our ancestorsnwho saw more accurately,had a competitive advantage comparednto those who saw less accurately,,and therefore they were more likelynto pass on their genes.,We are the offspring of thosenwho saw more accurately,,and so we can be confident that,nin the normal case,,our perceptions are accurate.,You see this in the standard textbooks.,One textbook says, for example,,"Evolutionarily speaking,,vision is useful preciselynbecause it is so accurate.",So the idea is that accurate perceptionsnare fitter perceptions.,They give you a survival advantage. 
 Now, is this correct?,Is this the right interpretationnof evolutionary theory?,Well, let's first look at a couplenof examples in nature. 
 The Australian jewel beetle,is dimpled, glossy and brown.,The female is flightless.,The male flies, looking,nof course, for a hot female.,When he finds one, he alights and mates.,There's another species in the outback,,Homo sapiens.,The male of this speciesnhas a massive brain,that he uses to hunt for cold beer.,(Laughter),And when he finds one, he drains it,,and sometimes throws the bottleninto the outback.,Now, as it happens, these bottlesnare dimpled, glossy,,and just the right shade of brownnto tickle the fancy of these beetles.,The males swarm all overnthe bottles trying to mate.,They lose all interestnin the real females.,Classic case of the malenleaving the female for the bottle.,(Laughter) (Applause),The species almost went extinct.,Australia had to change its bottlesnto save its beetles.,(Laughter),Now, the males had successfullynfound females for thousands,,perhaps millions of years.,It looked like they saw realitynas it is, but apparently not.,Evolution had given them a hack.,A female is anything dimpled,nglossy and brown,,the bigger the better.,(Laughter),Even when crawling all over the bottle,nthe male couldn't discover his mistake. 
 Now, you might say, beetles, sure,nthey're very simple creatures,,but surely not mammals.,Mammals don't rely on tricks.,Well, I won't dwell on this,nbut you get the idea. (Laughter) 
 So this raises an importantntechnical question:,Does natural selection really favornseeing reality as it is?,Fortunately, we don't havento wave our hands and guess;,evolution is a mathematicallynprecise theory.,We can use the equations of evolutionnto check this out.,We can have various organismsnin artificial worlds compete,and see which survive and which thrive,,which sensory systems are more fit. 
 A key notion in thosenequations is fitness.,Consider this steak:,What does this steak donfor the fitness of an animal?,Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,nit enhances fitness.,For a well-fed lion looking to mate,nit doesn't enhance fitness.,And for a rabbit in any state,nit doesn't enhance fitness,,so fitness does dependnon reality as it is, yes,,but also on the organism,nits state and its action.,Fitness is not the same thingnas reality as it is,,and it's fitness,nand not reality as it is,,that figures centrallynin the equations of evolution. 
 So, in my lab,,we have run hundreds of thousandsnof evolutionary game simulations,with lots of differentnrandomly chosen worlds,and organisms that competenfor resources in those worlds.,Some of the organismsnsee all of the reality,,others see just part of the reality,,and some see none of the reality,,only fitness.,Who wins? 
 Well, I hate to break it to you,nbut perception of reality goes extinct.,In almost every simulation,,organisms that see none of reality,but are just tuned to fitness,drive to extinction all the organismsnthat perceive reality as it is.,So the bottom line is, evolutionndoes not favor veridical,,or accurate perceptions.,Those perceptions of reality go extinct. 
 Now, this is a bit stunning.,How can it be that not seeingnthe world accurately,gives us a survival advantage?,That is a bit counterintuitive.,But remember the jewel beetle.,The jewel beetle survivednfor thousands, perhaps millions of years,,using simple tricks and hacks.,What the equationsnof evolution are telling us,is that all organisms, including us, nare in the same boat as the jewel beetle.,We do not see reality as it is.,We're shaped with tricksnand hacks that keep us alive. 
 Still,,we need some help with our intuitions.,How can not perceivingnreality as it is be useful?,Well, fortunately, we havena very helpful metaphor:,the desktop interface on your computer.,Consider that blue iconnfor a TED Talk that you're writing.,Now, the icon is blue and rectangular,and in the lower right cornernof the desktop.,Does that mean that the text file itselfnin the computer is blue,,rectangular, and in the lowernright-hand corner of the computer?,Of course not.,Anyone who thought that misinterpretsnthe purpose of the interface.,It's not there to show younthe reality of the computer.,In fact, it's there to hide that reality.,You don't want to know about the diodes,and resistors and allnthe megabytes of software.,If you had to deal with that,nyou could never write your text file,or edit your photo.,So the idea is that evolutionnhas given us an interface,that hides reality and guidesnadaptive behavior.,Space and time, as younperceive them right now,,are your desktop.,Physical objects are simply iconsnin that desktop. 
 There's an obvious objection.,Hoffman, if you think that trainncoming down the track at 200 MPH,is just an icon of your desktop,,why don't you step in front of it?,And after you're gone,nand your theory with you,,we'll know that there's morento that train than just an icon.,Well, I wouldn't stepnin front of that train,for the same reason,that I wouldn't carelessly dragnthat icon to the trash can:,not because I take the icon literally --,the file is not literally bluenor rectangular --,but I do take it seriously.,I could lose weeks of work.,Similarly, evolution has shaped us,with perceptual symbolsnthat are designed to keep us alive.,We'd better take them seriously.,If you see a snake, don't pick it up.,If you see a cliff, don't jump off.,They're designed to keep us safe,nand we should take them seriously.,That does not mean that wenshould take them literally.,That's a logical error. 
 Another objection: There'snnothing really new here.,Physicists have told us for a long timenthat the metal of that train looks solid,but really it's mostly empty spacenwith microscopic particles zipping around.,There's nothing new here.,Well, not exactly.,It's like saying, I know thatnthat blue icon on the desktop,is not the reality of the computer,,but if I pull out my trustynmagnifying glass and look really closely,,I see little pixels,,and that's the reality of the computer.,Well, not really -- you're stillnon the desktop, and that's the point.,Those microscopic particlesnare still in space and time:,they're still in the user interface.,So I'm saying something far more radicalnthan those physicists. 
 Finally, you might object,,look, we all see the train,,therefore none of us constructs the train.,But remember this example.,In this example, we all see a cube,,but the screen is flat,,so the cube that you seenis the cube that you construct.,We all see a cube,because we all, each one of us,nconstructs the cube that we see.,The same is true of the train.,We all see a train becausenwe each see the train that we construct,,and the same is truenof all physical objects. 
 We're inclined to think that perceptionnis like a window on reality as it is.,The theory of evolution is telling usnthat this is an incorrect interpretation,of our perceptions.,Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop,that's designed to hidenthe complexity of the real world,and guide adaptive behavior.,Space as you perceive it is your desktop.,Physical objects are justnthe icons in that desktop. 
 We used to think that the Earth is flatnbecause it looks that way.,Then we thought that the Earthnis the unmoving center of reality,because it looks that way.,We were wrong.,We had misinterpreted our perceptions.,Now we believe that spacetime and objects,are the nature of reality as it is.,The theory of evolution is telling usnthat once again, we're wrong.,We're misinterpreting the contentnof our perceptual experiences.,There's something that existsnwhen you don't look,,but it's not spacetimenand physical objects.,It's as hard for us to let gonof spacetime and objects,as it is for the jewel beetlento let go of its bottle.,Why? Because we're blindnto our own blindnesses.,But we have an advantagenover the jewel beetle:,our science and technology.,By peering through the lens of a telescope,we discovered that the Earthnis not the unmoving center of reality,,and by peering through the lensnof the theory of evolution,we discovered that spacetime and objects,are not the nature of reality.,When I have a perceptual experiencenthat I describe as a red tomato,,I am interacting with reality,,but that reality is not a red tomatonand is nothing like a red tomato.,Similarly, when I have an experiencenthat I describe as a lion or a steak,,I'm interacting with reality,,but that reality is not a lion or a steak.,And here's the kicker:,When I have a perceptual experiencenthat I describe as a brain, or neurons,,I am interacting with reality,,but that reality is not a brain or neurons,and is nothing like a brain or neurons.,And that reality, whatever it is,,is the real source of cause and effect,in the world -- not brains, not neurons.,Brains and neuronsnhave no causal powers.,They cause none of ournperceptual experiences,,and none of our behavior.,Brains and neurons are a species-specificnset of symbols, a hack. 
 What does this meannfor the mystery of consciousness?,Well, it opens up new possibilities.,For instance,,perhaps reality is some vast machinenthat causes our conscious experiences.,I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.,Perhaps reality is some vast,ninteracting network of conscious agents,,simple and complex, that causeneach other's conscious experiences.,Actually, this isn't as crazynan idea as it seems,,and I'm currently exploring it. 
 But here's the point:,Once we let go of our massively intuitive,but massively false assumptionnabout the nature of reality,,it opens up new ways to thinknabout life's greatest mystery.,I bet that reality will end upnturning out to be more fascinating,and unexpected than we've ever imagined. 
 The theory of evolution presents usnwith the ultimate dare:,Dare to recognize that perceptionnis not about seeing truth,,it's about having kids.,And by the way, even this TEDnis just in your head. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: If that'snreally you there, thank you.,So there's so much from this.,I mean, first of all, some peoplenmay just be profoundly depressed,at the thought that,nif evolution does not favor reality,,I mean, doesn't that to some extentnundermine all our endeavors here,,all our ability to thinknthat we can think the truth,,possibly even includingnyour own theory, if you go there? 
 Donald Hoffman: Well, this does notnstop us from a successful science.,What we have is one theorynthat turned out to be false,,that perception is like realitynand reality is like our perceptions.,That theory turns out to be false.,Okay, throw that theory away.,That doesn't stop us from now postulatingnall sorts of other theories,about the nature of reality,,so it's actually progress to recognizenthat one of our theories was false.,So science continues as normal.nThere's no problem here. 
 CA: So you think it's possiblen-- (Laughter) --,This is cool, but what you're sayingnI think is it's possible that evolution,can still get you to reason. 
 DH: Yes. Now that's a very,nvery good point.,The evolutionary game simulations that Inshowed were specifically about perception,,and they do show that our perceptionsnhave been shaped,not to show us reality as it is,,but that does not mean the same thingnabout our logic or mathematics.,We haven't done these simulations,nbut my bet is that we'll find,that there are some selection pressuresnfor our logic and our mathematics,to be at least in the direction of truth.,I mean, if you're like me,nmath and logic is not easy.,We don't get it all right, but at leastnthe selection pressures are not,uniformly away from true math and logic.,So I think that we'll find that we havento look at each cognitive faculty,one at a time and seenwhat evolution does to it.,What's true about perception may notnbe true about math and logic. 
 CA: I mean, really what you're proposingnis a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley,interpretation of the world:,consciousness causes matter,nnot the other way around. 
 DH: Well, it's slightlyndifferent than Berkeley.,Berkeley thought that, he was a deist,nand he thought that the ultimate,nature of reality is Godnand so forth,,and I don't need to gonwhere Berkeley's going,,so it's quite a bitndifferent from Berkeley.,I call this conscious realism.nIt's actually a very different approach. 
 CA: Don, I could literally talk with younfor hours, and I hope to do that. 
 Thanks so much for that.nDH: Thank you. (Applause)When I was nine years old,,my mom asked me what I would wantnmy house to look like,,and I drew this fairy mushroom.,And then she actually built it.,(Laughter) 
 I don't think I realizednthis was so unusual at the time,,and maybe I still haven't,,because I'm still designing houses.,This is a six-story bespoke homenon the island of Bali.,It's built almost entirely from bamboo.,The living room overlooks the valleynfrom the fourth floor.,You enter the house by a bridge.,It can get hot in the tropics,,so we make big curving roofsnto catch the breezes.,But some rooms have tall windowsnto keep the air conditioning in,and the bugs out.,This room we left open.,We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.,And one client wanted a TV roomnin the corner of her living room.,Boxing off an area with tall wallsnjust didn't feel right,,so instead, we made this giant woven pod. 
 Now, we do have all the necessarynluxuries, like bathrooms.,This one is a basketnin the corner of the living room,,and I've got tell you, some peoplenactually hesitate to use it.,We have not quite figured outnour acoustic insulation.,(Laughter),So there are lots of thingsnthat we're still working on,,but one thing I have learned,is that bamboo will treat you wellnif you use it right. 
 It's actually a wild grass.,It grows on otherwise unproductive land --,deep ravines, mountainsides.,It lives off of rainwater,nspring water, sunlight,,and of the 1,450 species of bamboonthat grow across the world,,we use just seven of them. 
 That's my dad.,He's the one who got menbuilding with bamboo,,and he is standing in a clump,of Dendrocalamus asper nigernthat he planted just seven years ago.,Each year, it sends upna new generation of shoots.,That shoot, we watched it grow a meternin three days just last week,,so we're talking about sustainablentimber in three years. 
 Now, we harvest from hundredsnof family-owned clumps.,Betung, as we call it, it's really long,,up to 18 meters of usable length.,Try getting that truck down the mountain.,And it's strong: it hasnthe tensile strength of steel,,the compressive strength of concrete.,Slam four tons straight down on a pole,,and it can take it.,Because it's hollow, it's lightweight,,light enough to be liftednby just a few men,,or, apparently, one woman. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 And when my fathernbuilt Green School in Bali,,he chose bamboo for allnof the buildings on campus,,because he saw it as a promise.,It's a promise to the kids.,It's one sustainable materialnthat they will not run out of.,And when I first saw these structuresnunder construction about six years ago,,I just thought, this makes perfect sense.,It is growing all around us.,It's strong. It's elegant.,It's earthquake-resistant.,Why hasn't this happened sooner,nand what can we do with it next? 
 So along with some ofnthe original builders of Green School,,I founded Ibuku.,Ibu means "mother," and ku means "mine,"nso it represents my Mother Earth,,and at Ibuku, we are a teamnof artisans, architects and designers,,and what we're doing togethernis creating a new way of building.,Over the past five years together,,we have built over 50 unique structures,nmost of them in Bali.,Nine of them are at Green Village --,you've just seen insidensome of these homes --,and we fill them with bespoke furniture,,we surround them with veggie gardens,,we would love to invite you allnto come visit someday.,And while you're there,nyou can also see Green School --,we keep buildingnclassrooms there each year --,as well as an updatednfairy mushroom house. 
 We're also working onna little house for export.,This is a traditional Sumbanese homenthat we replicated,,right down to the details and textiles.,A restaurantnwith an open-air kitchen.,It looks a lot like a kitchen, right?,And a bridge that spansn22 meters across a river. 
 Now, what we're doing,nit's not entirely new.,From little huts to elaborate bridgesnlike this one in Java,,bamboo has been in use acrossnthe tropical regions of the world,for literally tens of thousands of years.,There are islands and even continentsnthat were first reached by bamboo rafts.,But until recently,,it was almost impossible to reliablynprotect bamboo from insects,,and so, just about everythingnthat was ever built out of bamboo is gone.,Unprotected bamboo weathers.,Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.,And so that's why most people,nespecially in Asia,,think that you couldn't be poor enoughnor rural enough to actually want,to live in a bamboo house. 
 And so we thought,,what will it take to change their minds,,to convince peoplenthat bamboo is worth building with,,much less worth aspiring to? 
 First, we needed safe treatment solutions.,Borax is a natural salt.,It turns bamboo intona viable building material.,Treat it properly, design it carefully,,and a bamboo structurencan last a lifetime. 
 Second, build somethingnextraordinary out of it.,Inspire people.,Fortunately,,Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship.,It values the artisan.,So combine thosenwith the adventurous outliers,from new generationsnof locally trained architects,and designers and engineers,,and always remember that you are designing,for curving, tapering, hollow poles.,No two poles alike, no straight lines,,no two-by-fours here.,The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulasnand vocabulary of architecture,do not apply here.,We have had to invent our own rules.,We ask the bamboo what it's good at,nwhat it wants to become,,and what it says is: respect it,ndesign for its strengths,,protect it from water,nand to make the most of its curves. 
 So we design in real 3D,,making scale structural models,out of the same materialnthat we'll later use to build the house.,And bamboo model-making, it's an art,,as well as some hardcore engineering. 
 So that's the blueprint of the house. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we bring it to site,,and with tiny rulers,nwe measure each pole,,and consider each curve, and we choosena piece of bamboo from the pile,to replicate that house on site. 
 When it comes down to the details,nwe consider everything.,Why are doors so often rectangular?,Why not round?,How could you make a door better?,Well, its hinges battle with gravity,,and gravity will always win in the end,,so why not have it pivot on the center,where it can stay balanced?,And while you're at it,nwhy not doors shaped like teardrops? 
 To reap the selective benefitsnand work within the constraints,of this material,,we have really had to push ourselves,,and within that constraint,nwe have found space for something new.,It's a challenge: howndo you make a ceiling,if you don't have anynflat boards to work with?,Let me tell you, sometimes I dreamnof sheet rock and plywood.,(Laughter),But if what you've gotnis skilled craftsmen,and itsy bitsy little splits,,weave that ceiling together,,stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.,How do you design durablenkitchen countertops,that do justice to this curvingnstructure you've just built?,Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,,hand-carve each to fit the other,,leave the crusts on,,and what we're doing,nit is almost entirely handmade.,The structural connectionsnof our buildings,are reinforced by steel joints, but we usena lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.,There are thousands of pins in each floor.,This floor is made of glossynand durable bamboo skin.,You can feel the texture under bare feet. 
 And the floor that you walk on,,can it affect the way that you walk?,Can it change the footprintnthat you'll ultimately leave on the world?,I remember being nine years old,and feeling wonder,,and possibility,,and a little bit of idealism.,And we've got a really long way to go,,there's a lot left to learn,,but one thing I know is thatnwith creativity and commitment,,you can create beauty and comfort,and safety and even luxury,out of a material that will grow back. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The brain is an amazing and complex organ.,And while many peoplenare fascinated by the brain,,they can't really tell you that much,about the propertiesnabout how the brain works,because we don't teachnneuroscience in schools. 
 And one of the reasonsnwhy is that the equipment,is so complex and so expensive,that it's really only done at majornuniversities and large institutions.,And so in order to be ablento access the brain,,you really need to dedicate your life,and spend six and a half yearsnas a graduate student,just to become a neuroscientistnto get access to these tools. 
 And that's a shamenbecause one out of five of us,,that's 20 percent of the entire world,nwill have a neurological disorder.,And there are zero curesnfor these diseases.,And so it seems thatnwhat we should be doing,is reaching back earliernin the eduction process,and teaching students about neurosciencenso that in the future,,they may be thinking about possiblynbecoming a brain scientist. 
 When I was a graduate student,nmy lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,,decided that what if we tooknthis complex equipment that we have,for studying the brain and made it simplenenough and affordable enough,that anyone that you know, an amateurnor a high school student,,could learn and actually participatenin the discovery of neuroscience. 
 And so we did just that.,A few years ago, we startedna company called Backyard Brains,and we make DIY neuroscience equipmentnand I brought some here tonight,,and I want to do some demonstrations.,You guys want to see some? 
 So I need a volunteer.,So right before -- what is your name?n(Applause),Sam Kelly: Sam.,Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm goingnto record from your brain.,Have you had this before?,SK: No.,GG: I need you to stick outnyour arm for science,,roll up your sleeve a bit,,So what I'm going to do,nI'm putting electrodes on your arm,,and you're probably wondering,,I just said I'm going to record from yournbrain, what am I doing with your arm? 
 Well, you have about 80 billion neuronsninside your brain right now.,They're sending electrical messagesnback and forth, and chemical messages.,But some of your neuronsnright here in your motor cortex,are going to send messages downnwhen you move your arm like this.,They're going to go downnacross your corpus callosum,,down onto your spinal cordnto your lower motor neuron,out to your muscles here,,and that electrical dischargenis going to be picked up,by these electrodes right here,and we're going to be able to listen,to exactly what your brainnis going to be doing.,So I'm going to turn this on for a second. 
 Have you ever heardnwhat your brain sounds like?,SK: No.,GG: Let's try it out.nSo go ahead and squeeze your hand.,(Rumbling),So what you're listening to,,so this is your motor unitsnhappening right here.,Let's take a look at it as well.,So I'm going to stand over here,,and I'm going to open up our app here.,So now I want you to squeeze.,(Rumbling) 
 So right here, these are the motor unitsnthat are happening,from her spinal cordnout to her muscle right here,,and as she's doing it,,you're seeing the electrical activitynthat's happening here.,You can even click herenand try to see one of them.,So keep doing it really hard.,So now we've paused,on one motor action potential that'snhappening right now inside of your brain. 
 Do you guys want to see some more?,(Applause),That's interesting,nbut let's get it better.,I need one more volunteer.,What is your name, sir?,Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.,GG: Miguel, all right.,You're going to stand right here.,So when you're moving your arm like this,,your brain is sending a signalndown to your muscles right here.,I want you to move your arm as well.,So your brain is going to sendna signal down to your muscles.,And so it turns out that there isna nerve that's right here,that runs up here that innervatesnthese three fingers,,and it's close enough to the skinnthat we might be able,to stimulate that so that what we can do,is copy your brain signalsngoing out to your hand,and inject it into your hand,,so that your hand will movenwhen your brain tells your hand to move.,So in a sense, she will take awaynyour free will,and you will no longer havenany control over this hand.,You with me? 
 So I just need to hook you up.,(Laughter),So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,,which is probably right around here.,You don't know what you're signing up for,when you come up.,So now I'm going to move awaynand we're going to plug it in,to our human-to-human interface over here. 
 Okay, so Sam, I want younto squeeze your hand again.,Do it again. Perfect.,So now I'm going to hook you upnover here so that you get the --,It's going to feelna little bit weird at first,,this is going to feel like a --n(Laughter),You know, when you lose your free will,nand someone else becomes your agent,,it does feel a bit strange. 
 Now I want you to relax your hand.,Sam, you're with me?,So you're going to squeeze.,I'm not going to turn it on yet,nso go ahead and give it a squeeze. 
 So now, are you ready, Miguel?,MG: Ready as I'll ever be.,GG: I've turned it on, so go aheadnand turn your hand.,Do you feel that a little bit?nMG: Nope.,GG: Okay, do it again?nMG: A little bit.,GG: A little bit? (Laughter),So relax.,So hit it again.,(Laughter),Oh, perfect, perfect.,So relax, do it again. 
 All right, so right now,,your brain is controlling your armnand it's also controlling his arm,,so go ahead and just do it one more time.,All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter) 
 So now, what would happennif I took over my control of your hand?,And so, just relax your hand.,What happens?,Ah, nothing.,Why not?,Because the brain has to do it.,So you do it again.,All right, that's perfect. 
 Thank you guys for beingnsuch a good sport.,This is what's happeningnall across the world --,electrophysiology!,We're going to bring onnthe neuro-revolution. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: So I guessnwhat we're going to do is,we're going to talk about your life,,and using some picturesnthat you shared with me.,And I think we should startnright here with this one.,Okay, now who is this? 
 Martine Rothblatt: This is menwith our oldest son Eli.,He was about age five.,This is taken in Nigeria,right after having takennthe Washington, D.C. bar exam. 
 CA: Okay. But this doesn'tnreally look like a Martine. 
 MR: Right. That was myself as a male,nthe way I was brought up.,Before I transitioned from malento female and Martin to Martine. 
 CA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt. 
 MR: Correct. 
 CA: And about a year after this picture,nyou married a beautiful woman.,Was this love at first sight?nWhat happened there? 
 MR: It was love at the first sight.,I saw Bina at a discothequenin Los Angeles,,and we later began living together,,but the moment I saw her,nI saw just an aura of energy around her.,I asked her to dance.,She said she saw an auranof energy around me.,I was a single male parent.nShe was a single female parent.,We showed each othernour kids' pictures,,and we've been happily marriednfor a third of a century now.,(Applause) 
 CA: And at the time, you werenkind of this hotshot entrepreneur,,working with satellites.,I think you had two successful companies,,and then you startednaddressing this problem,of how could you use satellitesnto revolutionize radio.,Tell us about that. 
 MR: Right. I alwaysnloved space technology,,and satellites, to me, are sort ofnlike the canoes that our ancestors,first pushed out into the water.,So it was exciting for mento be part of the navigation,of the oceans of the sky,,and as I developed different typesnof satellite communication systems,,the main thing I did was to launchnbigger and more powerful satellites,,the consequence of whichnwas that the receiving antennas,could be smaller and smaller,,and after going throughndirect television broadcasting,,I had the idea that if we could makena more powerful satellite,,the receiving dish could be so small,that it would just be a sectionnof a parabolic dish,,a flat little plate embeddedninto the roof of an automobile,,and it would be possible to havennationwide satellite radio,,and that's Sirius XM today. 
 CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius? 
 (Applause) 
 MR: Thank you fornyour monthly subscriptions. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: So that succeeded despitenall predictions at the time.,It was a huge commercial success,,but soon after this, in the early 1990s,,there was this big transition in your lifenand you became Martine. 
 MR: Correct.nCA: So tell me, how did that happen?,MR: It happened in consultation with Binanand our four beautiful children,,and I discussed with each of them,that I felt my soul was always female,nand as a woman,,but I was afraid people wouldnlaugh at me if I expressed it,,so I always kept it bottled up,and just showed my male side.,And each of themnhad a different take on this.,Bina said, "I love your soul,,and whether the outsidenis Martin and Martine,,it doesn't it matter to me,nI love your soul.",My son said, "If you become a woman,nwill you still be my father?",And I said, "Yes,nI'll always be your father,",and I'm still his father today.,My youngest daughter did an absolutelynbrilliant five-year-old thing.,She told people, "I love my dadnand she loves me.",So she had no problemnwith a gender blending whatsoever. 
 CA: And a couple years after this,nyou published this book:,"The Apartheid of Sex.",What was your thesis in this book? 
 MR: My thesis in this book is that therenare seven billion people in the world,,and actually, seven billion unique waysnto express one's gender.,And while people may haventhe genitals of a male or a female,,the genitals don't determine your gender,or even really your sexual identity.,That's just a matter of anatomy,and reproductive tracts,,and people could choosenwhatever gender they want,if they weren't forced by societyninto categories of either male or female,the way South Africa used to force peopleninto categories of black or white.,We know from anthropological sciencenthat race is fiction,,even though racism is very, very real,,and we now know from cultural studies,that separate male or female gendersnis a constructed fiction.,The reality is a gender fluidity,that crosses the entire continuumnfrom male to female. 
 CA: You yourself don't alwaysnfeel 100 percent female. 
 MR: Correct. I would say in some ways,I change my gender about as oftennas I change my hairstyle. 
 CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this isnyour gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.,And I guess she was about this agenwhen something pretty terrible happened. 
 MR: Yes, she was finding herselfnunable to walk up the stairs,in our house to her bedroom,,and after several months of doctors,,she was diagnosed to have a rare,nalmost invariably fatal disease,called pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 CA: So how did you respond to that? 
 MR: Well, we first tried to get hernto the best doctors we could.,We ended up at Children's NationalnMedical Center in Washington, D.C.,The head of pediatric cardiology,told us that he was going to refer hernto get a lung transplant,,but not to hold out any hope,,because there arenvery few lungs available,,especially for children.,He said that all peoplenwith this illness died,,and if any of you have seennthe film "Lorenzo's Oil,",there's a scene when the protagonist,kind of rolls down the stairwayncrying and bemoaning the fate of his son,,and that's exactlynhow we felt about Jenesis. 
 CA: But you didn't accept thatnas the limit of what you could do.,You started trying to researchnand see if you could find a cure somehow. 
 MR: Correct. She was in the intensivencare ward for weeks at a time,,and Bina and I would tag teamnto stay at the hospital,while the other watchednthe rest of the kids,,and when I was in the hospitalnand she was sleeping,,I went to the hospital library.,I read every article that I could findnon pulmonary hypertension.,I had not taken any biology,neven in college,,so I had to go from a biology textbooknto a college-level textbook,and then medical textbooknand the journal articles, back and forth,,and eventually I knew enough to thinknthat it might be possible,that somebody could find a cure.,So we started a nonprofit foundation.,I wrote a descriptionnasking people to submit grants,and we would pay for medical research.,I became an expert on the condition --ndoctors said to me, Martine,,we really appreciate all the fundingnyou've provided us,,but we are not going to be ablento find a cure in time,to save your daughter.,However, there is a medicine,that was developed at thenBurroughs Wellcome Company,that could halt the progressionnof the disease,,but Burroughs Wellcome has justnbeen acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.,They made a decision not to develop,any medicines for rarenand orphan diseases,,and maybe you could use your expertisenin satellite communications,to develop this curenfor pulmonary hypertension. 
 CA: So how on earth did you getnaccess to this drug? 
 MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome,and after three times being rejectednand having the door slammed in my face,because they weren't goingnto out-license the drug,to a satellite communications expert,,they weren't going to send the drugnout to anybody at all,,and they thoughtnI didn't have the expertise,,finally I was able to persuadena small team of people to work with me,and develop enough credibility.,I wore down their resistance,,and they had no hope this drugnwould even work, by the way,,and they tried to tell me,n"You're just wasting your time.,We're sorry about your daughter.",But finally, for 25,000 dollars,and agreement to pay 10 percentnof any revenues we might ever get,,they agreed to give menworldwide rights to this drug. 
 CA: And so you put this drug on the marketnin a really brilliant way,,by basically charging what it would takento make the economics work. 
 MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn'tna drug that I ended up --,after I wrote the check for 25,000,,and I said, "Okay, where'snthe medicine for Jenesis?",they said, "Oh, Martine,nthere's no medicine for Jenesis.,This is just something we tried in rats.",And they gave me, like,na little plastic Ziploc bag,of a small amount of powder.,They said, "Don't give it to any human,",and they gave me a piece of papernwhich said it was a patent,,and from that, we had to figure outna way to make this medicine.,A hundred chemists in the U.S.nat the top universities,all swore that little patentncould never be turned into a medicine.,If it was turned into a medicine,nit could never be delivered,because it had a half-lifenof only 45 minutes. 
 CA: And yet, a year or two later,nyou were there with a medicine,that worked for Jenesis. 
 MR: Chris, the astonishing thingnis that this absolutely worthless,piece of powder,that had the sparkle of a promisenof hope for Jenesis,is not only keeping Jenesisnand other people alive today,,but produces almost a billionnand a half dollars a year in revenue. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So here you go.,So you took this company public, right?,And made an absolute fortune.,And how much have you paid Glaxo,nby the way, after that 25,000? 
 MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay themn10 percent of 1.5 billion,,150 million dollars,nlast year 100 million dollars.,It's the best return on investmentnthey ever received. (Laughter) 
 CA: And the best news of all, I guess,,is this. 
 MR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutelynbrilliant young lady.,She's alive, healthy today at 30.,You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.,The most amazing thing about Jenesis,is that while she could donanything with her life,,and believe me, if you grew upnyour whole life with people,in your face sayingnthat you've got a fatal disease,,I would probably run to Tahiti and justnnot want to run into anybody again.,But instead she chooses to worknin United Therapeutics.,She says she wants to do all she cannto help other people,with orphan diseases get medicines,,and today, she's our project leadernfor all telepresence activities,,where she helps digitally unitenthe entire company to work together,to find cures for pulmonary hypertension. 
 CA: But not everyone who has this diseasenhas been so fortunate.,There are still many people dying,nand you are tackling that too. How? 
 MR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000npeople a year in the United States alone,,perhaps 10 times that number worldwide,,who continue to die of this illness,because the medicinesnslow down the progression,but they don't halt it.,The only cure for pulmonary hypertension,npulmonary fibrosis,,cystic fibrosis, emphysema,,COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,,is a lung transplant,,but sadly, there are only enoughnavailable lungs for 2,000 people,in the U.S. a yearnto get a lung transplant,,whereas nearly a halfnmillion people a year,die of end-stage lung failure.,CA: So how can you address that?,MR: So I conceptualize the possibility,that just like we keep cars and planes,and buildings going forever,with an unlimited supplynof building parts and machine parts,,why can't we create an unlimited supplynof transplantable organs,to keep people living indefinitely,,and especially people with lung disease.,So we've teamed up with the decodernof the human genome, Craig Venter,,and the company he founded,with Peter Diamandis,nthe founder of the X Prize,,to genetically modify,the pig genome,so that the pig's organs will notnbe rejected by the human body,and thereby to create an unlimited supply,of transplantable organs.,We do this through our company,nUnited Therapeutics. 
 CA: So you really believe that within,nwhat, a decade,,that this shortage of transplantable lungsnmaybe be cured, through these guys? 
 MR: Absolutely, Chris.,I'm as certain of that as I wasnof the success that we've had,with direct televisionnbroadcasting, Sirius XM.,It's actually not rocket science.,It's straightforward engineering awaynone gene after another.,We're so lucky to be born in the timenthat sequencing genomes,is a routine activity,,and the brilliant folksnat Synthetic Genomics,are able to zero in on the pig genome,,find exactly the genesnthat are problematic, and fix them. 
 CA: But it's not just bodies that --nthough that is amazing.,(Applause),It's not just long-lasting bodiesnthat are of interest to you now.,It's long-lasting minds.,And I think this graph for younsays something quite profound.,What does this mean? 
 MR: What this graph means,nand it comes from Ray Kurzweil,,is that the rate of developmentnin computer processing,hardware, firmware and software,,has been advancing along a curve,such that by the 2020s, as we sawnin earlier presentations today,,there will be information technology,that processes informationnand the world around us,at the same rate as a human mind. 
 CA: And so that being so, you're actuallyngetting ready for this world,by believing that we will soonnbe able to, what,,actually take the contents of our brainsnand somehow preserve them forever?,How do you describe that? 
 MR: Well, Chris, what we're working onnis creating a situation,where people can create a mind file,,and a mind file is the collectionnof their mannerisms, personality,,recollection, feelings,,beliefs, attitudes and values,,everything that we've poured todayninto Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,,and all of this information stored therenwill be able, in the next couple decades,,once software is ablento recapitulate consciousness,,be able to revive the consciousnessnwhich is imminent in our mind file. 
 CA: Now you're not justnmessing around with this.,You're serious. I mean, who is this? 
 MR: This is a robot version ofnmy beloved spouse, Bina.,And we call her Bina 48.,She was programmednby Hanson Robotics out of Texas.,There's the centerfoldnfrom National Geographic magazine,with one of her caregivers,,and she roams the web,and has hundreds of hoursnof Bina's mannerisms, personalities.,She's kind of like a two-year-old kid,,but she says thingsnthat blow people away,,best expressed by perhaps,a New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winningnjournalist Amy Harmon,who says her answersnare often frustrating,,but other times as compelling as thosenof any flesh person she's interviewed. 
 CA: And is your thinking here,npart of your hope here, is that,this version of Bina can in a sensenlive on forever, or some future upgrade,to this version can live on forever?,MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.,You know, it costs us virtually nothingnto store our mind files,on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.,Social media is I think one of the mostnextraordinary inventions of our time,,and as apps become availablenthat will allow us,to out-Siri Siri, better and better,,and develop consciousnessnoperating systems,,everybody in the world,nbillions of people,,will be able to developnmind clones of themselves,that will have their own life on the web. 
 CA: So the thing is, Martine,,that in any normal conversation,nthis would sound stark-staring mad,,but in the context of your life,nwhat you've done,,some of the things we've heard this week,,the constructed realitiesnthat our minds give,,I mean, you wouldn't bet against it. 
 MR: Well, I think it's really nothingncoming from me.,If anything, I'm perhaps a bitnof a communicator of activities,that are being undertakennby the greatest companies,in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.,There are tens of millions of peoplenworking on writing code,that expresses more and more aspectsnof our human consciousness,,and you don't have to be a geniusnto see that all these threads,are going to come togethernand ultimately create human consciousness,,and it's something we'll value.,There are so many thingsnto do in this life,,and if we could have a simulacrum,na digital doppelgänger of ourselves,that helps us process books, do shopping,,be our best friends,,I believe our mind clones,nthese digital versions of ourselves,,will ultimately be our best friends,,and for me personally and Bina personally,,we love each other like crazy.,Each day, we are always saying, like,,"Wow, I love you even morenthan 30 years ago.,And so for us, the prospect of mind clones,and regenerated bodies,is that our love affair, Chris,ncan go on forever.,And we never get bored of each other.nI'm sure we never will. 
 CA: I think Bina's here, right?nMR: She is, yeah.,CA: Would it be too much, I don't know,ndo we have a handheld mic?,Bina, could we invite you to the stage?nI just have to ask you one question.,Besides, we need to see you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, thank you.,Come and join Martine here.,I mean, look, when you got married,,if someone had told you that,nin a few years time,,the man you were marryingnwould become a woman,,and a few years after that,nyou would become a robot --,(Laughter) --,how has this gone? How has it been? 
 Bina Rothblatt: It's been reallynan exciting journey,,and I would have nevernthought that at the time,,but we started making goalsnand setting those goals,and accomplishing things,,and before you knew it,nwe just keep going up and up,and we're still not stopping,nso it's great. 
 CA: Martine told me somethingnreally beautiful,,just actually on Skype before this,,which was that he wantednto live for hundreds of years,as a mind file,,but not if it wasn't with you. 
 BR: That's right,nwe want to do it together.,We're cryonicists as well,nand we want to wake up together. 
 CA: So just so as you know,nfrom my point of view,,this isn't only one of the mostnastonishing lives I have heard,,it's one of the most astonishingnlove stories I've ever heard.,It's just a delight to have younboth here at TED.,Thank you so much. 
 MR: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I work with a bunch of mathematicians,nphilosophers and computer scientists,,and we sit around and think aboutnthe future of machine intelligence,,among other things.,Some people think that some of thesenthings are sort of science fiction-y,,far out there, crazy.,But I like to say,,okay, let's look at the modernnhuman condition.,(Laughter),This is the normal way for things to be. 
 But if we think about it,,we are actually recently arrivednguests on this planet,,the human species.,Think about if Earthnwas created one year ago,,the human species, then, nwould be 10 minutes old.,The industrial era startedntwo seconds ago.,Another way to look at this is to think ofnworld GDP over the last 10,000 years,,I've actually taken the troublento plot this for you in a graph.n,It looks like this.,(Laughter),It's a curious shapenfor a normal condition.,I sure wouldn't want to sit on it.,(Laughter) 
 Let's ask ourselves, what is the causenof this current anomaly?,Some people would say it's technology.,Now it's true, technology has accumulatednthrough human history,,and right now, technologynadvances extremely rapidly --,that is the proximate cause,,that's why we are currently nso very productive.,But I like to think back further nto the ultimate cause. 
 Look at these two highlyndistinguished gentlemen:,We have Kanzi --,he's mastered 200 lexicalntokens, an incredible feat.,And Ed Witten unleashed the secondnsuperstring revolution.,If we look under the hood, nthis is what we find:,basically the same thing.,One is a little larger,,it maybe also has a few tricksnin the exact way it's wired.,These invisible differences cannotnbe too complicated, however,,because there have onlynbeen 250,000 generations,since our last common ancestor.,We know that complicated mechanismsntake a long time to evolve.,So a bunch of relatively minor changes,take us from Kanzi to Witten,,from broken-off tree branchesnto intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
 So this then seems pretty obviousnthat everything we've achieved,,and everything we care about,,depends crucially on some relatively minornchanges that made the human mind.,And the corollary, of course,nis that any further changes,that could significantly changenthe substrate of thinking,could have potentially nenormous consequences. 
 Some of my colleagues nthink we're on the verge,of something that could causena profound change in that substrate,,and that is machine superintelligence.,Artificial intelligence used to benabout putting commands in a box.,You would have human programmers,that would painstakingly nhandcraft knowledge items.,You build up these expert systems,,and they were kind of useful nfor some purposes,,but they were very brittle,nyou couldn't scale them.,Basically, you got out onlynwhat you put in.,But since then,,a paradigm shift has taken placenin the field of artificial intelligence. 
 Today, the action is really naround machine learning.,So rather than handcrafting knowledgenrepresentations and features,,we create algorithms that learn,noften from raw perceptual data.,Basically the same thingnthat the human infant does.,The result is A.I. that is notnlimited to one domain --,the same system can learn to translate nbetween any pairs of languages,,or learn to play any computer gamenon the Atari console.,Now of course,,A.I. is still nowhere near havingnthe same powerful, cross-domain,ability to learn and plannas a human being has.,The cortex still has some nalgorithmic tricks,that we don't yet knownhow to match in machines. 
 So the question is,,how far are we from being ablento match those tricks?,A couple of years ago,,we did a survey of some of the world's nleading A.I. experts,,to see what they think,nand one of the questions we asked was,,"By which year do you thinknthere is a 50 percent probability,that we will have achieved nhuman-level machine intelligence?",We defined human-level here nas the ability to perform,almost any job at least as wellnas an adult human,,so real human-level, not justnwithin some limited domain.,And the median answer was 2040 or 2050,,depending on precisely which ngroup of experts we asked.,Now, it could happen much,nmuch later, or sooner,,the truth is nobody really knows. 
 What we do know is that the ultimate nlimit to information processing,in a machine substrate lies far outside nthe limits in biological tissue.,This comes down to physics.,A biological neuron fires, maybe, nat 200 hertz, 200 times a second.,But even a present-day transistornoperates at the Gigahertz.,Neurons propagate slowly in axons,n100 meters per second, tops.,But in computers, signals can travelnat the speed of light.,There are also size limitations,,like a human brain has nto fit inside a cranium,,but a computer can be the sizenof a warehouse or larger.,So the potential for superintelligence nlies dormant in matter,,much like the power of the atom nlay dormant throughout human history,,patiently waiting there until 1945.,In this century,,scientists may learn to awakennthe power of artificial intelligence.,And I think we might then seenan intelligence explosion. 
 Now most people, when they thinknabout what is smart and what is dumb,,I think have in mind a picturenroughly like this.,So at one end we have the village idiot,,and then far over at the other side,we have Ed Witten, or Albert Einstein,nor whoever your favorite guru is.,But I think that from the point of viewnof artificial intelligence,,the true picture is actuallynprobably more like this:,AI starts out at this point here,nat zero intelligence,,and then, after many, many nyears of really hard work,,maybe eventually we get tonmouse-level artificial intelligence,,something that can navigate ncluttered environments,as well as a mouse can.,And then, after many, many more yearsnof really hard work, lots of investment,,maybe eventually we get tonchimpanzee-level artificial intelligence.,And then, after even more years nof really, really hard work,,we get to village idiot nartificial intelligence.,And a few moments later, nwe are beyond Ed Witten.,The train doesn't stopnat Humanville Station.,It's likely, rather, to swoosh right by. 
 Now this has profound implications,,particularly when it comes nto questions of power.,For example, chimpanzees are strong --,pound for pound, a chimpanzee is aboutntwice as strong as a fit human male.,And yet, the fate of Kanzi nand his pals depends a lot more,on what we humans do than onnwhat the chimpanzees do themselves.,Once there is superintelligence,,the fate of humanity may dependnon what the superintelligence does.,Think about it:,Machine intelligence is the last inventionnthat humanity will ever need to make.,Machines will then be better nat inventing than we are,,and they'll be doing so non digital timescales.,What this means is basicallyna telescoping of the future.,Think of all the crazy technologies nthat you could have imagined,maybe humans could have developednin the fullness of time:,cures for aging, space colonization,,self-replicating nanobots or uploadingnof minds into computers,,all kinds of science fiction-y stuff,that's nevertheless consistent nwith the laws of physics.,All of this superintelligence could ndevelop, and possibly quite rapidly. 
 Now, a superintelligence with such ntechnological maturity,would be extremely powerful,,and at least in some scenarios,nit would be able to get what it wants.,We would then have a future that wouldnbe shaped by the preferences of this A.I.,Now a good question is,nwhat are those preferences?,Here it gets trickier.,To make any headway with this,,we must first of allnavoid anthropomorphizing.,And this is ironic because nevery newspaper article,about the future of A.I.nhas a picture of this:,So I think what we need to do isnto conceive of the issue more abstractly,,not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios. 
 We need to think of intelligence nas an optimization process,,a process that steers the futureninto a particular set of configurations.,A superintelligence isna really strong optimization process.,It's extremely good at using navailable means to achieve a state,in which its goal is realized.,This means that there is no necessarynconnection between,being highly intelligent in this sense,,and having an objective that we humansnwould find worthwhile or meaningful. 
 Suppose we give an A.I. the goal nto make humans smile.,When the A.I. is weak, it performs usefulnor amusing actions,that cause its user to smile.,When the A.I. becomes superintelligent,,it realizes that there is a moreneffective way to achieve this goal:,take control of the world,and stick electrodes into the facialnmuscles of humans,to cause constant, beaming grins.,Another example,,suppose we give A.I. the goal to solvena difficult mathematical problem.,When the A.I. becomes superintelligent,,it realizes that the most effective way nto get the solution to this problem,is by transforming the planetninto a giant computer,,so as to increase its thinking capacity.,And notice that this gives the A.I.snan instrumental reason,to do things to us that wenmight not approve of.,Human beings in this model are threats,,we could prevent the mathematicalnproblem from being solved. 
 Of course, perceivably things won't ngo wrong in these particular ways;,these are cartoon examples.,But the general point here is important:,if you create a really powerfulnoptimization process,to maximize for objective x,,you better make sure nthat your definition of x,incorporates everything you care about.,This is a lesson that's also taughtnin many a myth.,King Midas wishes that everythingnhe touches be turned into gold.,He touches his daughter, nshe turns into gold.,He touches his food, it turns into gold.,This could become practically relevant,,not just as a metaphor for greed,,but as an illustration of what happens,if you create a powerfulnoptimization process,and give it misconceived nor poorly specified goals. 
 Now you might say, if a computer startsnsticking electrodes into people's faces,,we'd just shut it off.,A, this is not necessarily so easy to donif we've grown dependent on the system --,like, where is the off switch nto the Internet?,B, why haven't the chimpanzeesnflicked the off switch to humanity,,or the Neanderthals?,They certainly had reasons.,We have an off switch, nfor example, right here.,(Choking),The reason is that we are nan intelligent adversary;,we can anticipate threats nand plan around them.,But so could a superintelligent agent,,and it would be much better nat that than we are.,The point is, we should not be confidentnthat we have this under control here. 
 And we could try to make our jobna little bit easier by, say,,putting the A.I. in a box,,like a secure software environment,,a virtual reality simulationnfrom which it cannot escape.,But how confident can we be thatnthe A.I. couldn't find a bug.,Given that merely human hackersnfind bugs all the time,,I'd say, probably not very confident.,So we disconnect the ethernet cablento create an air gap,,but again, like merely human hackers,routinely transgress air gapsnusing social engineering.,Right now, as I speak,,I'm sure there is some employeenout there somewhere,who has been talked into handing out nher account details,by somebody claiming to benfrom the I.T. department. 
 More creative scenarios are also possible,,like if you're the A.I.,,you can imagine wiggling electrodesnaround in your internal circuitry,to create radio waves that youncan use to communicate.,Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction,,and then when the programmers opennyou up to see what went wrong with you,,they look at the source code -- Bam! --,the manipulation can take place.,Or it could output the blueprintnto a really nifty technology,,and when we implement it,,it has some surreptitious side effectnthat the A.I. had planned.,The point here is that we should nnot be confident in our ability,to keep a superintelligent genienlocked up in its bottle forever.,Sooner or later, it will out. 
 I believe that the answer herenis to figure out,how to create superintelligent A.I.nsuch that even if -- when -- it escapes,,it is still safe because it isnfundamentally on our side,because it shares our values.,I see no way around nthis difficult problem. 
 Now, I'm actually fairly optimisticnthat this problem can be solved.,We wouldn't have to write down na long list of everything we care about,,or worse yet, spell it out nin some computer language,like C++ or Python,,that would be a task beyond hopeless.,Instead, we would create an A.I.nthat uses its intelligence,to learn what we value,,and its motivation system is constructednin such a way that it is motivated,to pursue our values or to perform actionsnthat it predicts we would approve of.,We would thus leverage nits intelligence as much as possible,to solve the problem of value-loading. 
 This can happen,,and the outcome could be nvery good for humanity.,But it doesn't happen automatically.,The initial conditions nfor the intelligence explosion,might need to be set up nin just the right way,if we are to have a controlled detonation.,The values that the A.I. hasnneed to match ours,,not just in the familiar context,,like where we can easily checknhow the A.I. behaves,,but also in all novel contextsnthat the A.I. might encounter,in the indefinite future. 
 And there are also some esoteric issuesnthat would need to be solved, sorted out:,the exact details of its decision theory,,how to deal with logicalnuncertainty and so forth.,So the technical problems that neednto be solved to make this work,look quite difficult --,not as difficult as making na superintelligent A.I.,,but fairly difficult.,Here is the worry:,Making superintelligent A.I.nis a really hard challenge.,Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe,involves some additional nchallenge on top of that.,The risk is that if somebody figures outnhow to crack the first challenge,without also having cracked nthe additional challenge,of ensuring perfect safety. 
 So I think that we shouldnwork out a solution,to the control problem in advance,,so that we have it available nby the time it is needed.,Now it might be that we cannot solventhe entire control problem in advance,because maybe some elementsncan only be put in place,once you know the details of the narchitecture where it will be implemented.,But the more of the control problemnthat we solve in advance,,the better the odds that the transitionnto the machine intelligence era,will go well. 
 This to me looks like a thingnthat is well worth doing,and I can imagine that if nthings turn out okay,,that people a million years from nownlook back at this century,and it might well be that they say thatnthe one thing we did that really mattered,was to get this thing right. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a plant geneticist.,I study genes that make plantsnresistant to disease,and tolerant of stress.,In recent years,,millions of people around the worldnhave come to believe,that there's something sinisternabout genetic modification.,Today, I am going to providena different perspective. 
 First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.,He's an organic farmer.,On his farm, he plantsna variety of different crops.,This is one of the manynecological farming practices,he uses to keep his farm healthy.,Imagine some of the reactions we get:,"Really? An organic farmernand a plant geneticist?,Can you agree on anything?" 
 Well, we can, and it's not difficult,nbecause we have the same goal.,We want to help nourishnthe growing population,without further destroyingnthe environment.,I believe this is the greatestnchallenge of our time. 
 Now, genetic modification is not new;,virtually everything we eatnhas been genetically modified,in some manner.,Let me give you a few examples.,On the left is an image,of the ancient ancestor of modern corn.,You see a single roll of grainnthat's covered in a hard case.,Unless you have a hammer,,teosinte isn't good for making tortillas.,Now, take a look atnthe ancient ancestor of banana.,You can see the large seeds.,And unappetizing brussel sprouts,,and eggplant, so beautiful. 
 Now, to create these varieties,,breeders have used many differentngenetic techniques over the years.,Some of them are quite creative,,like mixing two different species together,using a process called grafting,to create this varietynthat's half tomato and half potato.,Breeders have also usednother types of genetic techniques,,such as random mutagenesis,,which induces uncharacterized mutations,into the plants.,The rice in the cerealnthat many of us fed our babies,was developed using this approach. 
 Now, today, breeders haveneven more options to choose from.,Some of them are extraordinarily precise. 
 I want to give you a couple examplesnfrom my own work.,I work on rice, which is a staple foodnfor more than half the world's people.,Each year, 40 percentnof the potential harvest,is lost to pest and disease.,For this reason,nfarmers plant rice varieties,that carry genes for resistance.,This approach has been usednfor nearly 100 years.,Yet, when I started graduate school,,no one knew what these genes were.,It wasn't until the 1990snthat scientists finally uncovered,the genetic basis of resistance.,In my laboratory, we isolated a genenfor immunity to a very serious,bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.,We found we could engineer the geneninto a conventional rice variety,that's normally susceptible,,and you can see the two leavesnon the bottom here,are highly resistant to infection. 
 Now, the same monthnthat my laboratory published,our discovery on the rice immunity gene,,my friend and colleague Dave Mackillnstopped by my office.,He said, "Seventy million rice farmersnare having trouble growing rice.",That's because their fields are flooded,,and these rice farmers are livingnon less than two dollars a day.,Although rice grows wellnin standing water,,most rice varieties will dienif they're submerged,for more than three days.,Flooding is expectednto be increasingly problematic,as the climate changes.,He told me that his graduate studentnKenong Xu and himself,were studying an ancient variety of ricenthat had an amazing property.,It could withstand two weeksnof complete submergence.,He asked if I would be willingnto help them isolate this gene.,I said yes -- I was very excited,nbecause I knew if we were successful,,we could potentially helpnmillions of farmers grow rice,even when their fields were flooded. 
 Kenong spent 10 yearsnlooking for this gene.,Then one day, he said,,"Come look at this experiment.nYou've got to see it.",I went to the greenhouse and I saw,that the conventional varietynthat was flooded for 18 days had died,,but the rice variety that wenhad genetically engineered,with a new gene we had discovered,ncalled Sub1, was alive.,Kenong and I were amazed and excited,that a single gene could haventhis dramatic effect.,But this is just a greenhouse experiment.,Would this work in the field? 
 Now, I'm going to show youna four-month time lapse video,taken at the InternationalnRice Research Institute.,Breeders there developedna rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene,using another genetic techniquencalled precision breeding.,On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,,and on the rightnis the conventional variety.,Both varieties do very well at first,,but then the field is flooded for 17 days.,You can see the Sub1 variety does great.,In fact, it producesnthree and a half times more grain,than the conventional variety.,I love this video,because it shows the powernof plant genetics to help farmers.,Last year, with the helpnof the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,,three and a half million farmersngrew Sub1 rice. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Now, many people don't mindngenetic modification,when it comes to moving rice genes around,,rice genes in rice plants,,or even when it comesnto mixing species together,through grafting or random mutagenesis.,But when it comes to taking genesnfrom viruses and bacteria,and putting them into plants,,a lot of people say, "Yuck.",Why would you do that?,The reason is that sometimesnit's the cheapest, safest,,and most effective technology,for enhancing food securitynand advancing sustainable agriculture.,I'm going to give you three examples. 
 First, take a look at papaya.nIt's delicious, right?,But now, look at this papaya.,This papaya is infectednwith papaya ringspot virus.,In the 1950s, this virusnnearly wiped out the entire production,of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.,Many people thoughtnthat the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,,but then, a local Hawaiian,,a plant pathologistnnamed Dennis Gonsalves,,decided to try to fight this diseasenusing genetic engineering.,He took a snippet of viral DNAnand he inserted it,into the papaya genome.,This is kind of like a humanngetting a vaccination.,Now, take a look at his field trial.,You can see the geneticallynengineered papaya in the center.,It's immune to infection.,The conventional papaya around the outsidenis severely infected with the virus.,Dennis' pioneering work is creditednwith rescuing the papaya industry.,Today, 20 years later, there's still nonother method to control this disease.,There's no organic method.nThere's no conventional method.,Eighty percent of Hawaiian papayanis genetically engineered. 
 Now, some of you may still feel a littlenqueasy about viral genes in your food,,but consider this:,The genetically engineered papayancarries just a trace amount of the virus.,If you bite into an organicnor conventional papaya,that is infected with the virus,,you will be chewing on tenfoldnmore viral protein. 
 Now, take a look at this pestnfeasting on an eggplant.,The brown you see is frass,,what comes outnthe back end of the insect.,To control this serious pest,,which can devastate the entireneggplant crop in Bangladesh,,Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides,two to three times a week,,sometimes twice a day,nwhen pest pressure is high.,But we know that some insecticidesnare very harmful to human health,,especially when farmers and their families,cannot afford proper protection,nlike these children.,In less developed countries,nit's estimated that 300,000 people,die every year because ofninsecticide misuse and exposure.,Cornell and Bangladeshi scientistsndecided to fight this disease,using a genetic technique that buildsnon an organic farming approach.,Organic farmers like my husband Raoulnspray an insecticide called B.T.,,which is based on a bacteria.,This pesticide is very specificnto caterpillar pests,,and in fact, it's nontoxicnto humans, fish and birds.,It's less toxic than table salt.,But this approachndoes not work well in Bangladesh.,That's because these insecticide sprays,are difficult to find, they're expensive,,and they don't prevent the insectnfrom getting inside the plants.,In the genetic approach, scientistsncut the gene out of the bacteria,and insert it directly intonthe eggplant genome.,Will this work to reduceninsecticide sprays in Bangladesh?,Definitely.,Last season, farmers reported they werenable to reduce their insecticide use,by a huge amount, almost down to zero.,They're able to harvestnand replant for the next season. 
 Now, I've given you a couple examplesnof how genetic engineering can be used,to fight pests and disease,and to reduce the amount of insecticides.,My final example is an example,where genetic engineeringncan be used to reduce malnutrition.,In less developed countries,,500,000 children go blind every yearnbecause of lack of Vitamin A.,More than half will die.,For this reason, scientists supportednby the Rockefeller Foundation,genetically engineered a golden rice,to produce beta-carotene,nwhich is the precursor of Vitamin A.,This is the same pigmentnthat we find in carrots.,Researchers estimate that just one cupnof golden rice per day,will save the livesnof thousands of children.,But golden rice is virulently opposed,by activists who arenagainst genetic modification.,Just last year,,activists invaded and destroyedna field trial in the Philippines.,When I heard about the destruction,,I wondered if they knew that theynwere destroying much more,than a scientific research project,,that they were destroying medicinesnthat children desperately needed,to save their sight and their lives. 
 Some of my friends and family still worry:,How do you know genesnin the food are safe to eat?,I explained the genetic engineering,,the process of movingngenes between species,,has been used for more than 40 years,in wines, in medicine,nin plants, in cheeses.,In all that time, there hasn't beenna single case of harm,to human health or the environment.,But I say, look, I'm notnasking you to believe me.,Science is not a belief system.,My opinion doesn't matter.,Let's look at the evidence.,After 20 years of careful studynand rigorous peer review,by thousands of independent scientists,,every major scientific organizationnin the world has concluded,that the crops currentlynon the market are safe to eat,and that the processnof genetic engineering,is no more risky than older methodsnof genetic modification.,These are precisely the samenorganizations that most of us trust,when it comes to othernimportant scientific issues,such as global climate changenor the safety of vaccines. 
 Raoul and I believe that, instead ofnworrying about the genes in our food,,we must focus on how we can helpnchildren grow up healthy.,We must ask if farmersnin rural communities can thrive,,and if everyone can afford the food.,We must try to minimizenenvironmental degradation.,What scares me most aboutnthe loud arguments and misinformation,about plant genetics,is that the poorest peoplenwho most need the technology,may be denied access because ofnthe vague fears and prejudices,of those who have enough to eat. 
 We have a huge challenge in front of us.,Let's celebrate scientificninnovation and use it.,It's our responsibility,to do everything we can to helpnalleviate human suffering,and safeguard the environment. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued.,The people who argue against GMOs,,as I understand it, the core piecencomes from two things.,One, complexity andnunintended consequence.,Nature is this incredibly complex machine.,If we put out these brand new genesnthat we've created,,that haven't been challengednby years of evolution,,and they started mixing upnwith the rest of what's going on,,couldn't that trigger some kindnof cataclysm or problem,,especially when you add innthe commercial incentive,that some companies havento put them out there?,The fear is that those incentives,mean that the decision is not madenon purely scientific grounds,,and even if it was, that there would benunintended consequences.,How do we know that there isn'tna big risk of some unintended consequence?,Often our tinkerings with naturendo lead to big, unintended consequences,and chain reactions. 
 Pamela Ronald: Okay,nso on the commercial aspects,,one thing that's really importantnto understand is that,,in the developed world,nfarmers in the United States,,almost all farmers, whethernthey're organic or conventional,,they buy seed produced by seed companies.,So there's definitely a commercialninterest to sell a lot of seed,,but hopefully they're selling seednthat the farmers want to buy.,It's different in thenless developed world.,Farmers there cannot afford the seed.,These seeds are not being sold.,These seeds are being distributed freely,through traditional kindsnof certification groups,,so it is very importantnin less developed countries,that the seed be freely available. 
 CA: Wouldn't some activists say that thisnis actually part of the conspiracy?,This is the heroin strategy.,You seed the stuff,nand people have no choice,but to be hooked on these seeds forever? 
 PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theoriesnfor sure, but it doesn't work that way.,For example, the seed that's beingndistributed, the flood-tolerant rice,,this is distributed freely,through Indian and Bangladeshinseed certification agencies,,so there's no commercial interest at all.,The golden rice was developed throughnsupport of the Rockefeller Foundation.,Again, it's being freely distributed.,There are no commercial profits,in this situation.,And now to address your other questionnabout, well, mixing genes,,aren't there some unintended consequences?,Absolutely -- every timenwe do something different,,there's an unintended consequence,,but one of the points I was trying to make,is that we've been doingnkind of crazy things to our plants,,mutagenesis using radiationnor chemical mutagenesis.,This induces thousandsnof uncharacterized mutations,,and this is even a higher risknof unintended consequence,than many of the modern methods.,And so it's really importantnnot to use the term GMO,because it's scientifically meaningless.,I feel it's very important to talknabout a specific crop,and a specific product, and think aboutnthe needs of the consumer. 
 CA: So part of what's happening herenis that there's a mental model,in a lot of people that nature is nature,nand it's pure and pristine,,and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.,It's making something that's purendangerous in some way,,and I think you're sayingnthat that whole model,just misunderstands how nature is.,Nature is a much more chaoticninterplay of genetic changes,that have been happeningnall the time anyway. 
 PR: That's absolutely true, and there'snno such thing as pure food.,I mean, you could not sprayneggplant with insecticides,or not genetically engineer it,nbut then you'd be stuck eating frass.,So there's no purity there. 
 CA: Pam Ronald, thank you. nThat was powerfully argued.,PR: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.,(Applause)What do you do when you have a headache?,You swallow an aspirin.,But for this pill to getnto your head, where the pain is,,it goes through your stomach, intestinesnand various other organs first. 
 Swallowing pills is the most effectivenand painless way of delivering,any medication in the body.,The downside, though, is that swallowingnany medication leads to its dilution.,And this is a big problem,nparticularly in HIV patients.,When they take their anti-HIV drugs,,these drugs are good for loweringnthe virus in the blood,,and increasing the CD4 cell counts.,But they are also notoriousnfor their adverse side effects,,but mostly bad, because they get dilutednby the time they get to the blood,,and worse, by the timenthey get to the sites,where it matters most:nwithin the HIV viral reservoirs.,These areas in the body --nsuch as the lymph nodes,,the nervous system,nas well as the lungs --,where the virus is sleeping,,and will not readilynget delivered in the blood,of patients that are undernconsistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.,However, upon discontinuation of therapy,,the virus can awakenand infect new cells in the blood. 
 Now, all this is a big problem in treatingnHIV with the current drug treatment,,which is a life-long treatmentnthat must be swallowed by patients.,One day, I sat and thought,,"Can we deliver anti-HIV directlynwithin its reservoir sites,,without the risk of drug dilution?",As a laser scientist,nthe answer was just before my eyes:,Lasers, of course.,If they can be used for dentistry,,for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,,they can be used for anything imaginable,,including transporting drugs into cells. 
 As a matter of fact,nwe are currently using laser pulses,to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,,which open and close almostnimmediately in HIV-infected cells,,in order to deliver drugs within them.,"How is that possible?" you may ask.,Well, we shine a very powerfulnbut super-tiny laser beam,onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells,while these cells are immersednin liquid containing the drug.,The laser pierces the cell,nwhile the cell swallows the drug,in a matter of microseconds.,Before you even know it,,the induced holenbecomes immediately repaired. 
 Now, we are currently testingnthis technology in test tubes,or in Petri dishes,,but the goal is to getnthis technology in the human body,,apply it in the human body.,"How is that possible?" you may ask.,Well, the answer is:nthrough a three-headed device.,Using the first head, which is our laser,,we will make an incisionnin the site of infection.,Using the second head, which is a camera,,we meander to the site of infection.,Finally, using a third head,nwhich is a drug-spreading sprinkler,,we deliver the drugs directlynat the site of infection,,while the laser is again usednto poke those cells open. 
 Well, this might not seemnlike much right now.,But one day, if successful,nthis technology can lead,to complete eradicationnof HIV in the body.,Yes. A cure for HIV.,This is every HIV researcher's dream --,in our case, a cure lead by lasers. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here to tell younabout the real search for alien life.,Not little green humanoidsnarriving in shiny UFOs,,although that would be nice.,But it's the search for planetsnorbiting stars far away. 
 Every star in our sky is a sun.,And if our sun has planets --,Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,,surely those other starsnshould have planets also,,and they do.,And in the last two decades,,astronomers have foundnthousands of exoplanets. 
 Our night sky is literallynteeming with exoplanets.,We know, statistically speaking,,that every star has at least one planet.,And in the search for planets,,and in the future,nplanets that might be like Earth,,we're able to help address,some of the most amazingnand mysterious questions,that have faced humankind for centuries.,Why are we here?,Why does our universe exist?,How did Earth form and evolve?,How and why did life originatenand populate our planet?,The second questionnthat we often think about is:,Are we alone?,Is there life out there?,Who is out there?,You know, this question has been aroundnfor thousands of years,,since at least the timenof the Greek philosophers.,But I'm here to tell younjust how close we're getting,to finding out the answernto this question.,It's the first time in human historynthat this really is within reach for us. 
 Now when I think about the possibilitiesnfor life out there,,I think of the fact that our sunnis but one of many stars.,This is a photograph of a real galaxy,,we think our Milky Waynlooks like this galaxy.,It's a collection of bound stars.,But our [sun] is onenof hundreds of billions of stars,and our galaxy is one of upwardsnof hundreds of billions of galaxies.,Knowing that small planetsnare very common,,you can just do the math.,And there are just so many starsnand so many planets out there,,that surely, there must be lifensomewhere out there.,Well, the biologists get furiousnwith me for saying that,,because we have absolutely no evidencenfor life beyond Earth yet. 
 Well, if we were able to looknat our galaxy from the outside,and zoom in to where our sun is,,we see a real map of the stars.,And the highlighted starsnare those with known exoplanets.,This is really justnthe tip of the iceberg.,Here, this animation is zooming innonto our solar system.,And you'll see here the planets,as well as some spacecraftnthat are also orbiting our sun.,Now if we can imagine goingnto the West Coast of North America,,and looking out at the night sky,,here's what we'd see on a spring night.,And you can seenthe constellations overlaid,and again, so many stars with planets.,There's a special patch of the skynwhere we have thousands of planets. 
 This is where the Kepler Space Telescopenfocused for many years.,Let's zoom in and looknat one of the favorite exoplanets.,This star is called Kepler-186f.,It's a system of about five planets.,And by the way, most of these exoplanets,nwe don't know too much about.,We know their size, and their orbitnand things like that.,But there's a very special planetnhere called Kepler-186f.,This planet is in a zonenthat is not too far from the star,,so that the temperaturenmay be just right for life.,Here, the artist's conceptionnis just zooming in,and showing you what that planetnmight be like. 
 So, many people have thisnromantic notion of astronomers,going to the telescopenon a lonely mountaintop,and looking at the spectacular night skynthrough a big telescope.,But actually, we just worknon our computers like everyone else,,and we get our data by emailnor downloading from a database.,So instead of coming here to tell you,about the somewhat tedious naturenof the data and data analysis,and the complex computer models we make,,I have a different waynto try to explain to you,some of the thingsnthat we're thinking about exoplanets. 
 Here's a travel poster:,"Kepler-186f:,Where the grass is always reddernon the other side.",That's because Kepler-186fnorbits a red star,,and we're just speculatingnthat perhaps the plants there,,if there is vegetationnthat does photosynthesis,,it has different pigments and looks red.,"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,,a Super-Earth.",This planet is more massive than Earth,and has a higher surface gravity.,"Relax on Kepler-16b,,where your shadow always has company.",(Laughter),We know of a dozen planetsnthat orbit two stars,,and there's likely many more out there.,If we could visit one of those planets,,you literally would see two sunsets,and have two shadows.,So actually, science fictionngot some things right.,Tatooine from Star Wars.,And I have a couple of othernfavorite exoplanets,to tell you about.,This one is Kepler-10b,,it's a hot, hot planet.,It orbits over 50 times closer to its star,than our Earth does to our sun.,And actually, it's so hot,,we can't visit anynof these planets, but if we could,,we would melt long before we got there.,We think the surfacenis hot enough to melt rock,and has liquid lava lakes. 
 Gliese 1214b.,This planet, we know the mass and the size,and it has a fairly low density.,It's somewhat warm.,We actually don't knownreally anything about this planet,,but one possibilitynis that it's a water world,,like a scaled-up versionnof one of Jupiter's icy moons,that might be 50 percent water by mass.,And in this case, it would havena thick steam atmosphere,overlaying an ocean,,not of liquid water,,but of an exotic formnof water, a superfluid --,not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.,And under that wouldn't be rock,,but a form of high-pressure ice,,like ice IX. 
 So out of all these planets out there,,and the varietynis just simply astonishing,,we mostly want to find the planetsnthat are Goldilocks planets, we call them.,Not too big, not too small,,not too hot, not too cold --,but just right for life.,But to do that,nwe'd have to be able to look,at the planet's atmosphere,,because the atmospherenacts like a blanket trapping heat --,the greenhouse effect.,We have to be able to assessnthe greenhouse gases,on other planets.,Well, science fictionngot some things wrong.,The Star Trek Enterprise,had to travel vast distancesnat incredible speeds,to orbit other planets,so that First Officer Spockncould analyze the atmosphere,to see if the planet was habitable,or if there were lifeforms there. 
 Well, we don't neednto travel at warp speeds,to see other planet atmospheres,,although I don't want to dissuadenany budding engineers,from figuring out how to do that.,We actually can and do studynplanet atmospheres,from here, from Earth orbit.,This is a picture, a photographnof the Hubble Space Telescope,taken by the shuttle Atlantisnas it was departing,after the lastnhuman space flight to Hubble.,They installed a new camera, actually,,that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.,And so far, we've been able to studyndozens of exoplanet atmospheres,,about six of them in great detail.,But those are notnsmall planets like Earth.,They're big, hot planetsnthat are easy to see.,We're not ready,,we don't have the right technology yetnto study small exoplanets.,But nevertheless,,I wanted to try to explain to younhow we study exoplanet atmospheres. 
 I want you to imagine,nfor a moment, a rainbow.,And if we could looknat this rainbow closely,,we would see that somendark lines are missing.,And here's our sun,,the white light of our sun split up,,not by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.,And you can seenall these dark, vertical lines.,Some are very narrow, some are wide,,some are shaded at the edges.,And this is actually how astronomersnhave studied objects in the heavens,,literally, for over a century.,So here, each different atom and molecule,has a special set of lines,,a fingerprint, if you will.,And that's how we studynexoplanet atmospheres.,And I'll just never forgetnwhen I started working,on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,,how many people told me,,"This will never happen.,We'll never be able to study them.nWhy are you bothering?",And that's why I'm pleased to tell younabout all the atmospheres studied now,,and this is really a field of its own.,So when it comes tonother planets, other Earths,,in the future when we can observe them,,what kind of gasesnwould we be looking for?,Well, you know, our own Earthnhas oxygen in the atmosphere,to 20 percent by volume.,That's a lot of oxygen.,But without plantsnand photosynthetic life,,there would be no oxygen,,virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.,So oxygen is here because of life.,And our goal then is to look for gasesnin other planet atmospheres,,gases that don't belong,,that we might be ablento attribute to life.,But which molecules should we search for?,I actually told younhow diverse exoplanets are.,We expect that to continue in the future,when we find other Earths. 
 And that's one of the main thingsnI'm working on now,,I have a theory about this.,It reminds me that nearly every day,,I receive an email or emails,from someone with a crazy theorynabout physics of gravity,or cosmology or some such.,So, please don't email menone of your crazy theories.,(Laughter),Well, I had my own crazy theory.,But, who does the MIT professor go to?,Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureatenin Physiology or Medicine,and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me.",So I brought my two biochemistry friends,and we went to talk to himnabout our crazy theory.,And that theory was that lifenproduces all small molecules,,so many molecules.,Like, everything I could think of,nbut not being a chemist.,Think about it:,carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,,molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,,methane, methyl chloride --,so many gases.,They also exist for other reasons,,but just life even produces ozone.,So we go to talk to him about this,,and immediately, he shot down the theory.,He found an example that didn't exist.,So, we went back to the drawing board,and we think we have found somethingnvery interesting in another field. 
 But back to exoplanets,,the point is that life producesnso many different types of gases,,literally thousands of gases.,And so what we're doing nownis just trying to figure out,on which types of exoplanets,,which gases could be attributed to life.,And so when it comes timenwhen we find gases,in exoplanet atmospheres,that we won't knownif they're being produced,by intelligent aliens or by trees,,or a swamp,,or even just by simple,nsingle-celled microbial life. 
 So working on the models,and thinking about biochemistry,,it's all well and good.,But a really big challengenahead of us is: how?,How are we going to find these planets?,There are actually many waysnto find planets,,several different ways.,But the one that I'm most focused onnis how can we open a gateway,so that in the future,,we can find hundreds of Earths.,We have a real shotnat finding signs of life.,And actually, I just finishednleading a two-year project,in this very special phase,of a concept we call the starshade.,And the starshadenis a very specially shaped screen,and the goal is to fly that starshade,so it blocks out the light of a star,so that the telescopencan see the planets directly.,Here, you can see myselfnand two team members,holding up one small partnof the starshade.,It's shaped like a giant flower,,and this is one of the prototype petals.,The concept is that a starshadenand telescope could launch together,,with the petals unfurlingnfrom the stowed position.,The central truss would expand,,with the petals snapping into place.,Now, this has to be made very precisely,,literally, the petals to microns,and they have to deploy to millimeters.,And this whole structure would have to fly,tens of thousands of kilometersnaway from the telescope.,It's about tens of meters in diameter.,And the goal is to block outnthe starlight to incredible precision,so that we'd be able to seenthe planets directly.,And it has to be a very special shape,,because of the physics of defraction.,Now this is a real projectnthat we worked on,,literally, you would not believe how hard.,Just so you believenit's not just in movie format,,here's a real photograph,of a second-generationnstarshade deployment test bed in the lab.,And in this case,nI just wanted you to know,that that central trussnhas heritage left over,from large radio deployables in space. 
 So after all of that hard work,where we try to think of all the crazyngases that might be out there,,and we build the veryncomplicated space telescopes,that might be out there,,what are we going to find?,Well, in the best case,,we will find an imagenof another exo-Earth.,Here is Earth as a pale blue dot.,And this is actuallyna real photograph of Earth,taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,,four billion miles away.,And that red light is just scattered lightnin the camera optics. 
 But what's so awesome to consider,is that if there are intelligent aliens,orbiting on a planetnaround a star near to us,and they build complicatednspace telescopes,of the kind that we're trying to build,,all they'll see is this pale blue dot,,a pinprick of light.,And so sometimes, when I pause to think,about my professional strugglenand huge ambition,,it's hard to think about that,in contrast to the vastnessnof the universe.,But nonetheless, I am devotingnthe rest of my life,to finding another Earth. 
 And I can guarantee 
 that in the next generationnof space telescopes,,in the second generation,,we will have the capabilitynto find and identity other Earths.,And the capabilitynto split up the starlight,so that we can look for gases,and assess the greenhouse gasesnin the atmosphere,,estimate the surface temperature,,and look for signs of life. 
 But there's more.,In this case of searchingnfor other planets like Earth,,we are making a new kind of map,of the nearby starsnand of the planets orbiting them,,including [planets] that actually might beninhabitable by humans. 
 And so I envision that our descendants,,hundreds of years from now,,will embark on an interstellarnjourney to other worlds.,And they will look back at all of us,as the generation who first foundnthe Earth-like worlds. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: And I give you,nfor a question,,Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen. 
 Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through,that the technologynto actually look at the spectrum,of an exoplanet like Earthnis not there yet.,When do you expect this will be there,,and what's needed? 
 Actually, what we expect is what we callnour next-generation Hubble telescope.,And this is called the James WebbnSpace Telescope,,and that will launch in 2018,,and that's what we're going to do,,we're going to looknat a special kind of planet,called transient exoplanets,,and that will be our first shotnat studying small planets,for gases that might indicatenthe planet is habitable. 
 JC: I'm going to ask younone follow-up question, too, Sara,,as the generalist.,So I am really strucknby the notion in your career,of the opposition you faced,,that when you began thinkingnabout exoplanets,,there was extreme skepticismnin the scientific community,that they existed,,and you proved them wrong.,What did it take to take that on? 
 SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,,we're supposed to be skeptical,,because our job to make surenthat what the other person is saying,actually makes sense or not.,But being a scientist,,I think you've seen it from this session,,it's like being an explorer.,You have this immense curiosity,,this stubbornness,,this sort of resolute willnthat you will go forward,no matter what other people say. 
 JC: I love that. Thank you, Sara. 
 (Applause)The child's symptoms begin,with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,,followed by vomiting and diarrhea,,then bleeding from the mouth,nnose and gums.,Death follows in the form of organ failurenfrom low blood pressure. 
 Sounds familiar?,If you're thinking this is Ebola,,actually, in this case, it's not.,It's an extreme form of dengue fever,na mosquito-born disease,which also does not havenan effective therapy or a vaccine,,and kills 22,000 people each year.,That is actually twicenthe number of people,that have been killed by Ebola,in the nearly four decadesnthat we've known about it.,As for measles, so muchnin the news recently,,the death toll is actually tenfold higher.,Yet for the last year,,it has been Ebola that has stolennall of the headlines and the fear. 
 Clearly, there is somethingndeeply rooted about it,,something which scares usnand fascinates us,more than other diseases.,But what is it, exactly?,Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,,but if you do, the risknof a horrible death is high.,Why?,Because right now, we don't have anyneffective therapy or vaccine available. 
 And so, that's the clue.,We may have it someday.,So we rightfully fear Ebola,,because it doesn't killnas many people as other diseases.,In fact, it's much less transmissiblenthan viruses such as flu or measles.,We fear Ebola because of the factnthat it kills us and we can't treat it.,We fear the certain inevitabilitynthat comes with Ebola.,Ebola has this inevitabilitynthat seems to defy modern medical science. 
 But wait a second, why is that?,We've known about Ebola since 1976.,We've known what it's capable of.,We've had ample opportunity to study it,in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.,And in fact, we've actually hadnvaccine candidates available now,for more than a decade.,Why is that those vaccinesnare just going into clinical trials now? 
 This goes to the fundamentalnproblem we have,with vaccine developmentnfor infectious diseases.,It goes something like this:,The people most at risk for these diseases,are also the ones least ablento pay for vaccines.,This leaves little in the waynof market incentives,for manufacturers to develop vaccines,,unless there are large numbers of peoplenwho are at risk in wealthy countries.,It's simply too commercially risky. 
 As for Ebola, there is absolutelynno market at all,,so the only reason we have two vaccinesnin late-stage clinical trials now,,is actually becausenof a somewhat misguided fear.,Ebola was relatively ignored,until September 11nand the anthrax attacks,,when all of a sudden,npeople perceived Ebola,as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon. 
 Why is it that the Ebola vaccinenwasn't fully developed at this point?,Well, partially, becausenit was really difficult --,or thought to be difficult --nto weaponize the virus,,but mainly becausenof the financial risk in developing it.,And this is really the point.,The sad reality is, we develop vaccines,not based upon the risknthe pathogen poses to people,,but on how economically risky it isnto develop these vaccines.,Vaccine developmentnis expensive and complicated.,It can cost hundredsnof millions of dollars,to take even a well-known antigennand turn it into a viable vaccine. 
 Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,,there are things we can donto remove some of these barriers.,The first is to recognizenwhen there's a complete market failure.,In that case, if we want vaccines,,we have to provide incentivesnor some type of subsidy.,We also need to do a better jobnat being able to figure out,which are the diseasesnthat most threaten us.,By creating capabilities within countries,nwe then create the ability,for those countries to createnepidemiological and laboratory networks,which are capable of collectingnand categorizing these pathogens.,The data from that then can be used,to understand the geographicnand genetic diversity,,which then can be usednto help us understand,how these are being changednimmunologically,,and what type of reactions they promote. 
 So these are the things that can be done,,but to do this, if we want to dealnwith a complete market failure,,we have to change the waynwe view and prevent infectious diseases.,We have to stop waitingnuntil we see evidence,of a disease becoming a global threatnbefore we consider it as one.,So, for Ebola,,the paranoid fearnof an infectious disease,,followed by a few casesntransported to wealthy countries,,led the global community to come together,,and with the worknof dedicated vaccine companies,,we now have these:,Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trialsnin the Ebola countries -- 
 (Applause) 
 and a pipeline of vaccinesnthat are following behind. 
 Every year, we spend billions of dollars,,keeping a fleet of nuclear submarinesnpermanently patrolling the oceans,to protect us from a threatnthat almost certainly will never happen.,And yet, we spend virtually nothing,to prevent something as tangiblenand evolutionarily certain,as epidemic infectious diseases.,And make no mistake about it --nit's not a question of "if," but "when.",These bugs are going to continue to evolve,and they're going to threaten the world.,And vaccines are our best defense.,So if we want to be able to preventnepidemics like Ebola,,we need to take on the risknof investing in vaccine development,and in stockpile creation.,And we need to view this, then,nas the ultimate deterrent --,something we make sure is available,,but at the same time,npraying we never have to use it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to younabout the future of medicine.,But before I do that, I want to talkna little bit about the past.,Now, throughout muchnof the recent history of medicine,,we've thought about illness and treatment,in terms of a profoundly simple model.,In fact, the model is so simple,that you could summarize it in six words:,have disease, take pill, kill something. 
 Now, the reasonnfor the dominance of this model,is of course the antibiotic revolution.,Many of you might not know this,nbut we happen to be celebrating,the hundredth year of the introductionnof antibiotics into the United States.,But what you do know,is that that introductionnwas nothing short of transformative.,Here you had a chemical,neither from the natural world,or artificially synthesizednin the laboratory,,and it would course through your body,,it would find its target,,lock into its target --,a microbe or some part of a microbe --,and then turn off a lock and a key,with exquisite deftness,nexquisite specificity.,And you would end up takingna previously fatal, lethal disease --,a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --,and transforming thatninto a curable, or treatable illness.,You have a pneumonia,,you take penicillin,,you kill the microbe,and you cure the disease. 
 So seductive was this idea,,so potent the metaphor of lock and key,and killing something,,that it really swept through biology.,It was a transformation like no other.,And we've really spent the last 100 years,trying to replicate that modelnover and over again,in noninfectious diseases,,in chronic diseases like diabetesnand hypertension and heart disease.,And it's worked,nbut it's only worked partly.,Let me show you.,You know, if you take the entire universe,of all chemical reactionsnin the human body,,every chemical reactionnthat your body is capable of,,most people think that that numbernis on the order of a million.,Let's call it a million.,And now you ask the question,,what number or fraction of reactions,can actually be targeted,by the entire pharmacopoeia,nall of medicinal chemistry?,That number is 250.,The rest is chemical darkness.,In other words, 0.025 percentnof all chemical reactions in your body,are actually targetablenby this lock and key mechanism.,You know, if you thinknabout human physiology,as a vast global telephone network,with interacting nodesnand interacting pieces,,then all of our medicinal chemistry,is operating on one tiny corner,at the edge, the outer edge,nof that network.,It's like all of ournpharmaceutical chemistry,is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas,who is tinkering with aboutn10 or 15 telephone lines. 
 So what do we do about this idea?,What if we reorganized this approach?,In fact, it turns outnthat the natural world,gives us a sense of how onenmight think about illness,in a radically different way,,rather than disease, medicine, target.,In fact, the natural worldnis organized hierarchically upwards,,not downwards, but upwards,,and we begin with a self-regulating,nsemi-autonomous unit called a cell.,These self-regulating,nsemi-autonomous units,give rise to self-regulating,nsemi-autonomous units called organs,,and these organs coalescento form things called humans,,and these organismsnultimately live in environments,,which are partly self-regulatingnand partly semi-autonomous. 
 What's nice about this scheme,nthis hierarchical scheme,building upwards rather than downwards,,is that it allows usnto think about illness as well,in a somewhat different way.,Take a disease like cancer.,Since the 1950s,,we've tried rather desperately to applynthis lock and key model to cancer.,We've tried to kill cells,using a variety of chemotherapies nor targeted therapies,,and as most of us know, that's worked.,It's worked for diseases like leukemia.,It's worked for some formsnof breast cancer,,but eventually you runnto the ceiling of that approach.,And it's only in the last 10 years or so,that we've begun to thinknabout using the immune system,,remembering that in fact the cancer cellndoesn't grow in a vacuum.,It actually grows in a human organism.,And could you use the organismal capacity,,the fact that human beingsnhave an immune system, to attack cancer?,In fact, it's led to the some of the mostnspectacular new medicines in cancer. 
 And finally there's the levelnof the environment, isn't there?,You know, we don't think of cancernas altering the environment.,But let me give you an examplenof a profoundly carcinogenic environment.,It's called a prison.,You take loneliness, you take depression,nyou take confinement,,and you add to that,,rolled up in a littlenwhite sheet of paper,,one of the most potent neurostimulantsnthat we know, called nicotine,,and you add to that one of the most potentnaddictive substances that you know,,and you havena pro-carcinogenic environment.,But you can have anti-carcinogenicnenvironments too.,There are attempts to create milieus,,change the hormonal milieunfor breast cancer, for instance.,We're trying to change the metabolicnmilieu for other forms of cancer. 
 Or take another disease, like depression.,Again, working upwards,,since the 1960s and 1970s,nwe've tried, again, desperately,to turn off moleculesnthat operate between nerve cells --,serotonin, dopamine --,and tried to cure depression that way,,and that's worked,nbut then that reached the limit.,And we now know that what younreally probably need to do,is to change the physiologynof the organ, the brain,,rewire it, remodel it,,and that, of course,nwe know study upon study has shown,that talk therapy does exactly that,,and study upon studynhas shown that talk therapy,combined with medicines, pills,,really is much more effectiventhan either one alone.,Can we imagine a more immersivenenvironment that will change depression?,Can you lock out the signalsnthat elicit depression?,Again, moving upwards along thisnhierarchical chain of organization.,What's really at stake perhaps here,is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.,Rather than killing something,,in the case of the greatnchronic degenerative diseases --,kidney failure, diabetes,nhypertension, osteoarthritis --,maybe what we really need to do is changenthe metaphor to growing something.,And that's the key, perhaps,,to reframing our thinking about medicine. 
 Now, this idea of changing,,of creating a perceptualnshift, as it were,,came home to me to roost in a verynpersonal manner about 10 years ago.,About 10 years ago --nI've been a runner most of my life --,I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,,I came back and woke upnand I basically couldn't move.,My right knee was swollen up,,and you could hear that ominous crunchnof bone against bone.,And one of the perks of being a physiciannis that you get to order your own MRIs.,And I had an MRI the next week,nand it looked like that.,Essentially, the meniscus of cartilagenthat is between bone,had been completely tornnand the bone itself had been shattered. 
 Now, if you're looking at menand feeling sorry,,let me tell you a few facts.,If I was to take an MRInof every person in this audience,,60 percent of you would show signs,of bone degenerationnand cartilage degeneration like this.,85 percent of all women by the age of 70,would show moderate to severencartilage degeneration.,50 to 60 percentnof the men in this audience,would also have such signs.,So this is a very common disease.,Well, the second perk of being a physician,is that you can getnto experiment on your own ailments.,So about 10 years ago we began,,we brought this processninto the laboratory,,and we began to do simple experiments,,mechanically tryingnto fix this degeneration.,We tried to inject chemicalsninto the knee spaces of animals,to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,,and to put a short summarynon a very long and painful process,,essentially it came to naught.,Nothing happened.,And then about seven years ago,nwe had a research student from Australia.,The nice thing about Australians,is that they're habitually used tonlooking at the world upside down. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so Dan suggested to me, "You know,nmaybe it isn't a mechanical problem.,Maybe it isn't a chemical problem.nMaybe it's a stem cell problem.",In other words, he had two hypotheses.,Number one, there is such a thingnas a skeletal stem cell --,a skeletal stem cell that builds upnthe entire vertebrate skeleton,,bone, cartilage and the fibrousnelements of skeleton,,just like there's a stem cell in blood,,just like there's a stem cellnin the nervous system.,And two, that maybe that, the degenerationnor dysfunction of this stem cell,is what's causing osteochondral arthritis,na very common ailment.,So really the question was,nwere we looking for a pill,when we should have reallynbeen looking for a cell.,So we switched our models,,and now we begannto look for skeletal stem cells.,And to cut again a long story short,,about five years ago,nwe found these cells.,They live inside the skeleton.,Here's a schematic and thenna real photograph of one of them.,The white stuff is bone,,and these red columns that you seenand the yellow cells,are cells that have arisennfrom one single skeletal stem cell --,columns of cartilage, columns of bonencoming out of a single cell.,These cells are fascinating.nThey have four properties.,Number one is that they livenwhere they're expected to live.,They live just underneathnthe surface of the bone,,underneath cartilage.,You know, in biology,nit's location, location, location.,And they move into the appropriate areasnand form bone and cartilage.,That's one.,Here's an interesting property.,You can take them outnof the vertebrate skeleton,,you can culture themnin petri dishes in the laboratory,,and they are dying to form cartilage.,Remember how we couldn'tnform cartilage for love or money?,These cells are dying to form cartilage.,They form their own furlsnof cartilage around themselves.,They're also, number three,,the most efficient repairersnof fractures that we've ever encountered.,This is a little bone,na mouse bone that we fractured,and then let it heal by itself.,These stem cells have come innand repaired, in yellow, the bone,,in white, the cartilage,nalmost completely.,So much so that if you label themnwith a fluorescent dye,you can see them like some kindnof peculiar cellular glue,coming into the area of a fracture,,fixing it locallynand then stopping their work.,Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,,and that is that their numbersndecline precipitously,,precipitously, tenfold,nfiftyfold, as you age. 
 And so what had happened, really,,is that we found ourselvesnin a perceptual shift.,We had gone hunting for pills,but we ended up finding theories.,And in some ways,we had hooked ourselvesnback onto this idea:,cells, organisms, environments,,because we were now thinkingnabout bone stem cells,,we were thinking about arthritisnin terms of a cellular disease. 
 And then the next question was,nare there organs?,Can you build thisnas an organ outside the body?,Can you implant cartilageninto areas of trauma?,And perhaps most interestingly,,can you ascend right upnand create environments?,You know, we knownthat exercise remodels bone,,but come on, none of usnis going to exercise.,So could you imagine ways of passivelynloading and unloading bone,so that you can recreatenor regenerate degenerating cartilage? 
 And perhaps more interesting,nand more importantly,,the question is, can you apply this modelnmore globally outside medicine?,What's at stake, as I said before,nis not killing something,,but growing something.,And it raises a series of, I think,nsome of the most interesting questions,about how we thinknabout medicine in the future.,Could your medicinenbe a cell and not a pill?,How would we grow these cells?,What we would we do to stopnthe malignant growth of these cells?,We heard about the problemsnof unleashing growth.,Could we implantnsuicide genes into these cells,to stop them from growing?,Could your medicine be an organnthat's created outside the body,and then implanted into the body?,Could that stop some of the degeneration?,What if the organ needed to have memory?,In cases of diseases of the nervous systemnsome of those organs had memory.,How could we implantnthose memories back in?,Could we store these organs?,Would each organ have to be developednfor an individual human being,and put back?,And perhaps most puzzlingly,,could your medicine be an environment?,Could you patent an environment?,You know, in every culture,,shamans have been usingnenvironments as medicines.,Could we imagine that for our future?,I've talked a lot about models.nI began this talk with models.,So let me end with some thoughtsnabout model building.,That's what we do as scientists.,You know, when an architectnbuilds a model,,he or she is trying to show youna world in miniature.,But when a scientist is building a model,,he or she is trying to show younthe world in metaphor.,He or she is trying to createna new way of seeing.,The former is a scale shift.nThe latter is a perceptual shift. 
 Now, antibiotics creatednsuch a perceptual shift,in our way of thinking about medicinenthat it really colored, distorted,,very successfully, the way we've thoughtnabout medicine for the last hundred years.,But we need new modelsnto think about medicine in the future.,That's what's at stake. 
 You know, there'sna popular trope out there,that the reason we haven't hadnthe transformative impact,on the treatment of illness,is because we don't havenpowerful-enough drugs,,and that's partly true.,But perhaps the real reason is,that we don't have powerful-enoughnways of thinking about medicines.,It's certainly true that,it would be lovely to have new medicines.,But perhaps what's really at stakenare three more intangible M's:,mechanisms, models, metaphors. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson:nI really like this metaphor.,How does it link in?,There's a lot of talk in technologyland,about the personalization of medicine,,that we have all this datanand that medical treatments of the future,will be for you specifically,nyour genome, your current context.,Does that apply to this modelnyou've got here? 
 Siddhartha Mukherjee:nIt's a very interesting question.,We've thought aboutnpersonalization of medicine,very much in terms of genomics.,That's because the genenis such a dominant metaphor,,again, to use that same word,nin medicine today,,that we think the genome will driventhe personalization of medicine.,But of course the genomenis just the bottom,of a long chain of being, as it were.,That chain of being, really the firstnorganized unit of that, is the cell.,So, if we are really going to delivernin medicine in this way,,we have to think of personalizingncellular therapies,,and then personalizingnorgan or organismal therapies,,and ultimately personalizingnimmersion therapies for the environment.,So I think at every stage, you know --,there's that metaphor,nthere's turtles all the way.,Well, in this, there'snpersonalization all the way. 
 CA: So when you saynmedicine could be a cell,and not a pill,,you're talking aboutnpotentially your own cells. 
 SM: Absolutely.nCA: So converted to stem cells,,perhaps tested against all kindsnof drugs or something, and prepared. 
 SM: And there's no perhaps.nThis is what we're doing.,This is what's happening,nand in fact, we're slowly moving,,not away from genomics,nbut incorporating genomics,into what we call multi-order,nsemi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,,like cells, like organs,nlike environments. 
 CA: Thank you so much. 
 SM: Pleasure. Thanks.Just after Christmas last year,,132 kids in California got the measles,by either visiting Disneyland,or being exposed to someonenwho'd been there.,The virus then hopped the Canadian border,,infecting more thann100 children in Quebec.,One of the tragic thingsnabout this outbreak,is that measles, which can be fatalnto a child with a weakened immune system,,is one of the most easilynpreventable diseases in the world.,An effective vaccine against it,has been available for morenthan half a century,,but many of the kids involvednin the Disneyland outbreak,had not been vaccinated,because their parents were afraid,of something allegedly even worse:,autism. 
 But wait -- wasn't the papernthat sparked the controversy,about autism and vaccines,debunked, retracted,,and branded a deliberate fraud,by the British Medical Journal?,Don't most science-savvy people,know that the theorynthat vaccines cause autism is B.S.?,I think most of you do,,but millions of parents worldwide,continue to fear that vaccinesnput their kids at risk for autism. 
 Why?,Here's why.,This is a graph of autismnprevalence estimates rising over time.,For most of the 20th century,,autism was considerednan incredibly rare condition.,The few psychologists and pediatriciansnwho'd even heard of it,figured they would get throughntheir entire careers,without seeing a single case.,For decades, the prevalence estimatesnremained stable,at just three or four children in 10,000.,But then, in the 1990s,,the numbers started to skyrocket.,Fundraising organizationsnlike Autism Speaks,routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,,as if you could catch itnfrom another kid at Disneyland. 
 So what's going on?,If it isn't vaccines, what is it?,If you ask the folks down atnthe Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,what's going on,,they tend to rely on phrases liken"broadened diagnostic criteria",and "better case finding",to explain these rising numbers.,But that kind of language,doesn't do much to allaynthe fears of a young mother,who is searching herntwo-year-old's face for eye contact.,If the diagnostic criterianhad to be broadened,,why were they so narrownin the first place?,Why were cases of autismnso hard to find,before the 1990s? 
 Five years ago, I decided to trynto uncover the answers to these questions.,I learned that what happened,has less to do with the slow and cautiousnprogress of science,than it does with the seductivenpower of storytelling.,For most of the 20th century,,clinicians told one story,about what autism isnand how it was discovered,,but that story turned out to be wrong,,and the consequences of it,are having a devastating impactnon global public health.,There was a second,nmore accurate story of autism,which had been lost and forgotten,in obscure cornersnof the clinical literature.,This second story tells us everythingnabout how we got here,and where we need to go next. 
 The first story starts with a childnpsychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital,named Leo Kanner.,In 1943, Kanner published a paper,describing 11 young patientsnwho seemed to inhabit private worlds,,ignoring the people around them,,even their own parents.,They could amuse themselves for hours,by flapping their handsnin front of their faces,,but they were panicked by little things,like their favorite toynbeing moved from its usual place,without their knowledge.,Based on the patientsnwho were brought to his clinic,,Kanner speculatednthat autism is very rare.,By the 1950s, as the world'snleading authority on the subject,,he declared that he had seennless than 150 true cases of his syndrome,while fielding referrals fromnas far away as South Africa.,That's actually not surprising,,because Kanner's criterianfor diagnosing autism,were incredibly selective.,For example, he discouraged givingnthe diagnosis to children who had seizures,but now we know that epilepsynis very common in autism.,He once bragged that he had turnednnine out of 10 kids,referred to his office as autisticnby other clinicians,without giving them an autism diagnosis. 
 Kanner was a smart guy,,but a number of his theoriesndidn't pan out.,He classified autism as a formnof infantile psychosis,caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.,These children, he said,,had been kept neatlynin a refrigerator that didn't defrost.,At the same time, however,,Kanner noticed that somenof his young patients,had special abilitiesnthat clustered in certain areas,like music, math and memory.,One boy in his clinic,could distinguish between 18 symphoniesnbefore he turned two.,When his mother put onnone of his favorite records,,he would correctly declare,n"Beethoven!",But Kanner took a dim viewnof these abilities,,claiming that the kidsnwere just regurgitating things,they'd heard their pompous parents say,,desperate to earn their approval.,As a result, autism becamena source of shame and stigma for families,,and two generations of autistic children,were shipped off to institutionsnfor their own good,,becoming invisible to the world at large. 
 Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s,that researchers began to testnKanner's theory that autism was rare.,Lorna Wing was a cognitivenpsychologist in London,who thought that Kanner's theorynof refrigerator parenting,were "bloody stupid," as she told me.,She and her husband John were warmnand affectionate people,,and they had a profoundlynautistic daughter named Susie.,Lorna and John knew how hard it wasnto raise a child like Susie,without support services,,special education,,and the other resources that arenout of reach without a diagnosis.,To make the casento the National Health Service,that more resources were needednfor autistic children and their families, 
 Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould,decided to do something that shouldnhave been done 30 years earlier.,They undertook a study of autismnprevalence in the general population.,They pounded the pavementnin a London suburb called Camberwell,to try to find autistic childrennin the community.,What they saw made clearnthat Kanner's model was way too narrow,,while the reality of autismnwas much more colorful and diverse.,Some kids couldn't talk at all,,while others waxed on at lengthnabout their fascination with astrophysics,,dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.,In other words, these childrenndidn't fit into nice, neat boxes,,as Judith put it,,and they saw lots of them,,way more than Kanner's monolithic modelnwould have predicted. 
 At first, they were at a lossnto make sense of their data.,How had no one noticednthese children before?,But then Lorna came upon a referencento a paper that had been published,in German in 1944,,the year after Kanner's paper,,and then forgotten,,buried with the ashes of a terrible time,that no one wanted to remembernor think about.,Kanner knew about this competing paper,,but scrupulously avoidednmentioning it in his own work.,It had never evennbeen translated into English,,but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,,and he translated it for her. 
 The paper offerednan alternate story of autism.,Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,,who ran a combination clinicnand residential school,in Vienna in the 1930s.,Asperger's ideas about teaching childrennwith learning differences,were progressive evennby contemporary standards.,Mornings at his clinic begannwith exercise classes set to music,,and the children put on playsnon Sunday afternoons.,Instead of blaming parentsnfor causing autism,,Asperger framed it as a lifelong,npolygenetic disability,that requires compassionate formsnof support and accommodations,over the course of one's whole life.,Rather than treating the kidsnin his clinic like patients,,Asperger called themnhis little professors,,and enlisted their help in developingnmethods of education,that were particularly suited to them.,Crucially, Asperger viewed autismnas a diverse continuum,that spans an astonishing rangenof giftedness and disability.,He believed that autismnand autistic traits are common,and always have been,,seeing aspects of this continuumnin familiar archetypes from pop culture,like the socially awkward scientist,and the absent-minded professor.,He went so far as to say,,it seems that for successnin science and art,,a dash of autism is essential. 
 Lorna and Judith realized that Kannernhad been as wrong about autism being rare,as he had been about parents causing it.,Over the next several years,,they quietly worked withnthe American Psychiatric Association,to broaden the criteria for diagnosis,to reflect the diversity of whatnthey called "the autism spectrum.",In the late '80s and early 1990s,,their changes went into effect,,swapping out Kanner's narrow model,for Asperger's broad and inclusive one. 
 These changes weren'tnhappening in a vacuum.,By coincidence, as Lorna and Judithnworked behind the scenes,to reform the criteria,,people all over the world were seeingnan autistic adult for the first time.,Before "Rain Man" came out in 1988,,only a tiny, ingrown circle of expertsnknew what autism looked like,,but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettablenperformance as Raymond Babbitt,earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,,pediatricians, psychologists,,teachers and parents all over the worldnknew what autism looked like. 
 Coincidentally, at the same time,,the first easy-to-use clinical testsnfor diagnosing autism were introduced.,You no longer had to have a connectionnto that tiny circle of experts,to get your child evaluated. 
 The combination of "Rain Man,",the changes to the criteria,nand the introduction of these tests,created a network effect,,a perfect storm of autism awareness.,The number of diagnoses started to soar,,just as Lorna and Judith predicted,nindeed hoped, that it would,,enabling autistic peoplenand their families,to finally get the supportnand services they deserved. 
 Then Andrew Wakefield came along,to blame the spikenin diagnoses on vaccines,,a simple, powerful,,and seductively believable story,that was as wrong as Kanner's theory,that autism was rare. 
 If the CDC's current estimate,,that one in 68 kids in Americanare on the spectrum, is correct,,autistics are one of the largestnminority groups in the world.,In recent years, autistic peoplenhave come together on the Internet,to reject the notion that theynare puzzles to be solved,by the next medical breakthrough,,coining the term "neurodiversity",to celebrate the varietiesnof human cognition. 
 One way to understand neurodiversity,is to think in termsnof human operating systems.,Just because a P.C. is not running Windowsndoesn't mean that it's broken.,By autistic standards,nthe normal human brain,is easily distractable,,obsessively social,,and suffers from a deficitnof attention to detail.,To be sure, autistic peoplenhave a hard time,living in a world not built for them.,[Seventy] years later, we're stillncatching up to Asperger,,who believed that the "cure"nfor the most disabling aspects of autism,is to be found in understanding teachers,,accommodating employers,,supportive communities,,and parents who have faithnin their children's potential. 
 An autistic [man]nnamed Zosia Zaks once said,,"We need all hands on decknto right the ship of humanity.",As we sail into an uncertain future,,we need every formnof human intelligence on the planet,working together to tacklenthe challenges that we face as a society.,We can't afford to waste a brain. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In 2011, during the final six monthsnof Kim Jong-Il's life,,I lived undercover in North Korea. 
 I was born and raisednin South Korea, their enemy.,I live in America, their other enemy. 
 Since 2002, I had visitednNorth Korea a few times.,And I had come to realizenthat to write about it with any meaning,,or to understand the placenbeyond the regime's propaganda,,the only option was total immersion.,So I posed as a teacher and a missionary,at an all-male university in Pyongyang. 
 The Pyongyang Universitynof Science and Technology,was founded by Evangelical Christiansnwho cooperate with the regime,to educate the sonsnof the North Korean elite,,without proselytizing,nwhich is a capital crime there.,The students were 270 young men,nexpected to be the future leaders,of the most isolated and brutalndictatorship in existence.,When I arrived, they became my students. 
 2011 was a special year,,marking the 100th anniversary of the birthnof North Korea's original Great Leader,,Kim Il-Sung.,To celebrate the occasion, the regimenshut down all universities,,and sent students off to the fields,to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal,as the world's most powerfulnand prosperous nation.,My students were the only onesnspared from that fate. 
 North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.,Everything therenis about the Great Leader.,Every book, every newspaper article,nevery song, every TV program --,there is just one subject.,The flowers are named after him,,the mountains are carved with his slogans.,Every citizen wears the badgenof the Great Leader at all times.,Even their calendar system beginsnwith the birth of Kim Il-Sung. 
 The school was a heavily guardednprison, posing as a campus.,Teachers could only leave on group outingsnaccompanied by an official minder.,Even then, our trips were limitednto sanctioned national monuments,celebrating the Great Leader.,The students were not allowednto leave the campus,,or communicate with their parents.,Their days were meticulously mapped out,nand any free time they had,was devoted to honoringntheir Great Leader.,Lesson plans had to meet the approvalnof North Korean staff,,every class was recorded and reported on,nevery room was bugged,,and every conversation, overheard.,Every blank space was covered with the nportraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,,like everywhere else in North Korea. 
 We were never allowednto discuss the outside world.,As students of science and technology,nmany of them were computer majors,but they did not knownthe existence of the Internet.,They had never heardnof Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.,Facebook, Twitter -- none of those thingsnwould have meant a thing.,And I could not tell them. 
 I went there looking for truth.,But where do you even startnwhen an entire nation's ideology,,my students' day-to-day realities,,and even my own positionnat the universities,,were all built on lies? 
 I started with a game.,We played "Truth and Lie.",A volunteer would write a sentencenon the chalkboard,,and the other students had to guess,whether it was a truth or a lie.,Once a student wrote, "I visitednChina last year on vacation,",and everyone shouted, "Lie!",They all knew this wasn't possible.,Virtually no North Korean is allowednto leave the country.,Even traveling within their own countrynrequires a travel pass. 
 I had hoped that this game would revealnsome truth about my students,,because they lie so often and so easily,,whether about the mythicalnaccomplishments of their Great Leader,,or the strange claim that they clonedna rabbit as fifth graders.,The difference between truth and liesnseemed at times hazy to them.,It took me a while to understandnthe different types of lies;,they lie to shield their systemnfrom the world,,or they were taught lies,nand were just regurgitating them.,Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.,But if all they have ever known were lies,,how could we expect them to be otherwise? 
 Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.,But that turned out to bennearly impossible.,Essays are about coming up withnone's own thesis,,and making an evidence-basednargument to prove it.,These students, however, werensimply told what to think,,and they obeyed.,In their world, critical thinkingnwas not allowed. 
 I also gave them the weekly assignmentnof writing a personal letter,,to anybody.,It took a long time, but eventuallynsome of them began to write,to their mothers, their friends,ntheir girlfriends.,Although those were just homework,,and would never reachntheir intended recipients,,my students slowly began to revealntheir true feelings in them.,They wrote that they were fednup with the sameness of everything.,They were worried about their future.,In those letters, they rarely evernmentioned their Great Leader. 
 I was spending all of my timenwith these young men.,We all ate meals together,nplayed basketball together.,I often called them gentlemen,nwhich made them giggle.,They blushed at the mention of girls.,And I came to adore them.,And watching them open upneven in the tiniest of ways,,was deeply moving. 
 But something also felt wrong.,During those monthsnof living in their world,,I often wondered if the truth would,nin fact, improve their lives.,I wanted so much to tell them the truth,,of their country and of the outside world,,where Arab youth were turningntheir rotten regime inside out,,using the power of social media,,where everyone except them wasnconnected through the world wide web,,which wasn't worldwide after all.,But for them, the truth was dangerous.,By encouraging them to run after it,nI was putting them at risk --,of persecution,,of heartbreak. 
 When you're not allowed to expressnanything in the open,,you become good at readingnwhat is unspoken.,In one of their personal letters to me,na student wrote that he understood,why I always called them gentlemen.,It was because I was wishing themnto be gentle in life, he said. 
 On my last day in December of 2011,,the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,,their world shattered.,I had to leave without a proper goodbye.,But I think they knewnhow sad I was for them. 
 Once, toward the end of my stay,na student said to me,,"Professor, we never think of younas being different from us.,Our circumstances are different,nbut you're the same as us.,We want you to know that we trulynthink of you as being the same." 
 Today, if I could respondnto my students with a letter of my own,,which is of course impossible,,I would tell them this:,"My dear gentlemen,,It's been a bit over three yearsnsince I last saw you.,And now, you must be 22 --nmaybe even as old as 23.,At our final class, I asked younif there was anything you wanted.,The only wish you expressed,nthe only thing you ever asked of me,in all those months we spent together,,was for me to speak to you in Korean.,Just once.,I was there to teach you English;,you knew it wasn't allowed.,But I understood then, you wantednto share that bond of our mother tongue.,I called you my gentlemen,,but I don't know if being gentlenin Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea,is a good thing.,I don't want you to lead a revolution --,let some other young person do it.,The rest of the world might casuallynencourage or even expect,some sort of North Korean Spring,,but I don't want you to do anything risky,,because I know in your world,nsomeone is always watching.,I don't want to imaginenwhat might happen to you.,If my attempts to reach you haveninspired something new in you,,I would rather you forget me.,Become soldiers of your Great Leader,nand live long, safe lives.,You once asked me if I thoughtnyour city of Pyongyang was beautiful,,and I could not answer truthfully then.,But I know why you asked.,I know that it was important for younto hear that I, your teacher,,the one who has seen the worldnthat you are forbidden from,,declare your city as the most beautiful.,I know hearing that would makenyour lives there a bit more bearable,,but no, I don't findnyour capital beautiful.,Not because it's monotone and concrete,,but because of what it symbolizes:,a monster that feeds offnthe rest of the country,,where citizens are soldiers and slaves.,All I see there is darkness.,But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.,And I hope instead that you,nmy lovely young gentlemen,,will one day help make it beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a potter,,which seems like a fairly humble vocation.,I know a lot about pots.,I've spent about 15 years making them.,One of the things that reallynexcites me in my artistic practice,and being trained as a potter,is that you very quickly learnnhow to make great things out of nothing;,that I spent a lot of time at my wheelnwith mounds of clay trying stuff;,and that the limitationsnof my capacity, my ability,,was based on my hands and my imagination;,that if I wanted to makena really nice bowl,and I didn't know how to make a foot yet,,I would have to learn how to make a foot;,that that process of learningnhas been very, very helpful to my life.,I feel like, as a potter,,you also start to learnnhow to shape the world. 
 There have been timesnin my artistic capacity,that I wanted to reflect,on other really important moments,in the history of the U.S.,nthe history of the world,where tough things happened,,but how do you talk about tough ideas,without separating peoplenfrom that content?,Could I use art like these old,ndiscontinued firehoses from Alabama,,to talk about the complexities of a momentnof civil rights in the '60s?,Is it possible to talk about my fathernand I doing labor projects?,My dad was a roofer, construction guy,nhe owned small businesses,,and at 80, he was ready to retirenand his tar kettle was my inheritance.,Now, a tar kettle doesn't soundnlike much of an inheritance. It wasn't.,It was stinky and it took upna lot of space in my studio,,but I asked my dad if he would be willingnto make some art with me,,if we could reimagine this kindnof nothing material,as something very special.,And by elevating the materialnand my dad's skill,,could we start to think about tarnjust like clay, in a new way,,shaping it differently,nhelping us to imagine what was possible? 
 After clay, I was then kind of turned onnto lots of different kinds of materials,,and my studio grew a lotnbecause I thought, well,,it's not really about the material,nit's about our capacity to shape things.,I became more and more interested in ideas,and more and more things that nwere happening just outside my studio.,Just to give you a little bit of context,nI live in Chicago.,I live on the South Side now.nI'm a West Sider.,For those of you who are not Chicagoans,nthat won't mean anything,,but if I didn't mentionnthat I was a West Sider,,there would be a lot of peoplenin the city that would be very upset. 
 The neighborhood that I live innis Grand Crossing.,It's a neighborhoodnthat has seen better days.,It is not a gated community by far.,There is lots of abandonmentnin my neighborhood,,and while I was kind of busynmaking pots and busy making art,and having a good art career,,there was all of this stuffnthat was happening,just outside my studio.,All of us know aboutnfailing housing markets,and the challenges of blight,,and I feel like we talk about itnwith some of our cities more than others,,but I think a lot of ournU.S. cities and beyond,have the challenge of blight,,abandoned buildings that peoplenno longer know what to do anything with.,And so I thought, is there a waynthat I could start to think,about these buildings as an extensionnor an expansion of my artistic practice?,And that if I was thinkingnalong with other creatives --,architects, engineers,nreal estate finance people --,that us together might be ablento kind of think,in more complicated waysnabout the reshaping of cities. 
 And so I bought a building.,The building was really affordable.,We tricked it out.,We made it as beautiful as we couldnto try to just get some activity happening,on my block.,Once I bought the buildingnfor about 18,000 dollars,,I didn't have any money left.,So I started sweeping the buildingnas a kind of performance.,This is performance art,nand people would come over,,and I would start sweeping.,Because the broom was freenand sweeping was free.,It worked out.,(Laughter),But we would use the building, then,nto stage exhibitions, small dinners,,and we found that that buildingnon my block, Dorchester --,we now referred to the blocknas Dorchester projects --,that in a way that buildingnbecame a kind of gathering site,for lots of different kinds of activity.,We turned the building intonwhat we called now the Archive House.,The Archive House would donall of these amazing things.,Very significant peoplenin the city and beyond,would find themselvesnin the middle of the hood.,And that's when I felt like,maybe there was a relationshipnbetween my history with clay,and this new thing that wasnstarting to develop,,that we were slowly starting,to reshape how people imaginednthe South Side of the city. 
 One house turned into a few houses,,and we always tried to suggest,that not only is creatingna beautiful vessel important,,but the contents of what happensnin those buildings is also very important.,So we were not only thinkingnabout development,,but we were thinking about the program,,thinking about the kind of connectionsnthat could happen,between one house and another,nbetween one neighbor and another.,This building became what we callnthe Listening House,,and it has a collection of discarded books,from the Johnson Publishing Corporation,,and other books from an old bookstorenthat was going out of business.,I was actually just wanting to activatenthese buildings as much as I could,with whatever and whoever would join me. 
 In Chicago, there'snamazing building stock.,This building, which had beennthe former crack house on the block,,and when the building became abandoned,,it became a great opportunity to reallynimagine what else could happen there.,So this space we converted intonwhat we call Black Cinema House.,Black Cinema House was an opportunitynin the hood to screen films,that were important and relevantnto the folk who lived around me,,that if we wanted to shownan old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.,If we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.,That would be awesome.,The building we soon outgrew,,and we had to move to a larger space.,Black Cinema House, which was madenfrom just a small piece of clay,,had to grow into a much largernpiece of clay, which is now my studio. 
 What I realized was thatnfor those of you who are zoning junkies,,that some of the things that I was doing,in these buildingsnthat had been left behind,,they were not the uses by whichnthe buildings were built,,and that there are city policies that say,,"Hey, a house that is residentialnneeds to stay residential.",But what do you do in neighborhoods whennain't nobody interested in living there?,That the people who haventhe means to leave have already left?,What do we do withnthese abandoned buildings?,And so I was tryingnto wake them up using culture. 
 We found that thatnwas so exciting for folk,,and people were so responsive to the work,nthat we had to then find bigger buildings.,By the time we found bigger buildings,,there was, in part, the resources nnecessary to think about those things.,In this bank that we called the Arts Bank,nit was in pretty bad shape.,There was about six feetnof standing water.,It was a difficult project to finance,,because banks weren't interestednin the neighborhood,because people weren't interestednin the neighborhood,because nothing had happened there.,It was dirt. It was nothing.nIt was nowhere.,And so we just started imagining,nwhat else could happen in this building?,(Applause) 
 And so now that the rumornof my block has spread,,and lots of people are starting to visit,,we've found that the bankncan now be a center,for exhibition, archives,nmusic performance,,and that there are peoplenwho are now interested,in being adjacent to those buildingsnbecause we brought some heat,,that we kind of made a fire. 
 One of the archives that we'll have therenis this Johnson Publishing Corporation.,We've also started to collectnmemorabilia from American history,,from people who livenor have lived in that neighborhood.,Some of these imagesnare degraded images of black people,,kind of historiesnof very challenging content,,and where better than a neighborhood,with young people who are constantlynasking themselves about their identity,to talk about some of the complexities,of race and class? 
 In some ways, the bank represents a hub,,that we're trying to create a pretty nhardcore node of cultural activity,,and that if we could startnto make multiple hubs,and connect some coolngreen stuff around there,,that the buildings that we'venpurchased and rehabbed,,which is now around 60 or 70 units,,that if we could landnminiature Versailles on top of that,,and connect these buildingsnby a beautiful greenbelt --,(Applause) --,that this place where peoplennever wanted to be,would become an important destination,for folk from all overnthe country and world. 
 In some ways, it feelsnvery much like I'm a potter,,that we tackle the thingsnthat are at our wheel,,we try with the skill that we have,to think about this next bowlnthat I want to make.,And it went from a bowl to a singularnhouse to a block to a neighborhood,to a cultural districtnto thinking about the city,,and at every point, there were thingsnthat I didn't know that I had to learn.,I've never learned so muchnabout zoning law in my life.,I never thought I'd have to.,But as a result of that, I'm findingnthat there's not just room,for my own artistic practice,,there's room for a lot of othernartistic practices. 
 So people started asking us,,"Well, Theaster, how are youngoing to go to scale?",and, "What's your sustainability plan?" 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 And what I found was thatnI couldn't export myself,,that what seems necessarynin cities like Akron, Ohio,,and Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,,is that there are people in those placesnwho already believe in those places,,that are already dyingnto make those places beautiful,,and that often, those peoplenwho are passionate about a place,are disconnected from the resourcesnnecessary to make cool things happen,,or disconnected fromna contingency of people,that could help make things happen.,So now, we're starting to give advicenaround the country,on how to start with what you got,,how to start with the thingsnthat are in front of you,,how to make something out of nothing,,how to reshape your worldnat a wheel or at your block,or at the scale of the city. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: Thank you. So I thinknmany people watching this,will be asking themselvesnthe question you just raised at the end:,How can they do this in their own city?,You can't export yourself.,Give us a few pages out of your playbooknabout what someone who is inspired,about their city can donto take on projects like yours? 
 Theaster Gates: One of the thingsnI've found that's really important,is giving thought to not justnthe kind of individual project,,like an old house,,but what's the relationshipnbetween an old house,,a local school, a small bodega,,and is there some kind of synergynbetween those things?,Can you get those folk talking?,I've found that in casesnwhere neighborhoods have failed,,they still often have a pulse.,How do you identify the pulsenin that place, the passionate people,,and then how do you get folknwho have been fighting,,slogging for 20 years, reenergizednabout the place that they live?,And so someone has to do that work.,If I were a traditional developer,nI would be talking about buildings alone,,and then puttingna "For Lease" sign in the window.,I think that you actuallynhave to curate more than that,,that there's a way in whichnyou have to be mindful about,,what are the businessesnthat I want to grow here?,And then, are there peoplenwho live in this place,who want to grow those businesses with me?,Because I think it's not justna cultural space or housing;,there has to be the recreationnof an economic core.,So thinking about those thingsntogether feels right. 
 JC: It's hard to get peoplento create the spark again,when people have beennslogging for 20 years.,Are there any methods you've foundnthat have helped break through? 
 TG: Yeah, I think that nownthere are lots of examples,of folk who are doing amazing work,,but those methods are sometimes like,nwhen the media is constantly saying,that only violent thingsnhappen in a place,,then based on your skill setnand the particular context,,what are the things that you can donin your neighborhood,to kind of fight some of that?,So I've found thatnif you're a theater person,,you have outdoor street theater festivals.,In some cases, we don't haventhe resources in certain neighborhoods,to do things that arena certain kind of splashy,,but if we can then find waysnof making sure that people,who are local to a place,,plus people who could be supportivenof the things that are happening locally,,when those people get together,,I think really amazing things can happen. 
 JC: So interesting.,And how can you make surenthat the projects you're creating,are actually for the disadvantaged,and not just for the sort ofnvegetarian indie movie crowd,that might move innto take advantage of them. 
 TG: Right on. So I think this is wherenit starts to get into the thick weeds. 
 JC: Let's go there.nTG: Right now, Grand Crossing,is 99 percent black, or at least living,,and we know that maybenwho owns property in a place,is different from who walksnthe streets every day.,So it's reasonable to saynthat Grand Crossing is already,in the process of being somethingndifferent than it is today.,But are there ways to think aboutnhousing trusts or land trusts,or a mission-based development,that starts to protectnsome of the space that happens,,because when you haven7,500 empty lots in a city,,you want something to happen there,,but you need entities that are notnjust interested in the development piece,,but entities that are interestednin the stabilization piece,,and I feel like often the developer piecenis really motivated,,but the other work of a kindnof neighborhood consciousness,,that part doesn't live anymore.,So how do you start to grow upnimportant watchdogs,that ensure that the resourcesnthat are made available,to new folk that are coming in,are also distributed to folknwho have lived in a place for a long time. 
 JC: That makes so much sense.nOne more question:,You make such a compelling case for beautynand the importance of beauty and the arts.,There would be others who would arguenthat funds would be better spent,on basic services for the disadvantaged.,How do you combat that viewpoint,nor come against it? 
 TG: I believe that beauty nis a basic service.,(Applause),Often what I have found is thatnwhen there are resources,that have not been made availablento certain under-resourced cities,or neighborhoods or communities,,that sometimes culture is the thingnthat helps to ignite,,and that I can't do everything,,but I think that there's a way in whichnif you can start with culture,and get people kind ofnreinvested in their place,,other kinds of adjacentnamenities start to grow,,and then people can make a demandnthat's a poetic demand,,and the political demands thatnare necessary to wake up our cities,,they also become very poetic. 
 JC: It makes perfect sense to me.,Theaster, thank you so muchnfor being here with us today.,Thank you. Theaster Gates. 
 (Applause)On the path that American children ntravel to adulthood,,two institutions oversee the journey.,The first is the one we hear na lot about: college.,Some of you may remembernthe excitement that you felt,when you first set off for college.,Some of you may be in college right now,and you're feeling this excitementnat this very moment. 
 College has some shortcomings.,It's expensive; it leavesnyoung people in debt.,But all in all, it's a pretty good path.,Young people emerge from collegenwith pride and with great friends,and with a lot of knowledge nabout the world.,And perhaps most importantly,,a better chance in the labor marketnthan they had before they got there. 
 Today I want to talk aboutnthe second institution,overseeing the journey from childhoodnto adulthood in the United States.,And that institution is prison.,Young people on this journeynare meeting with probation officers,instead of with teachers.,They're going to court datesninstead of to class.,Their junior year abroad is insteadna trip to a state correctional facility.,And they're emerging from their 20s,not with degrees in business and English,,but with criminal records. 
 This institution is also costing us a lot,,about 40,000 dollars a year,to send a young personnto prison in New Jersey.,But here, taxpayers are footing the bill,and what kids are gettingnis a cold prison cell,and a permanent mark against themnwhen they come home,and apply for work. 
 There are more and more kidsnon this journey to adulthood,than ever before in the United Statesnand that's because in the past 40 years,,our incarceration rate nhas grown by 700 percent.,I have one slide for this talk.,Here it is.,Here's our incarceration rate,,about 716 people per 100,000nin the population.,Here's the OECD countries. 
 What's more, it's poor kidsnthat we're sending to prison,,too many drawn from African-Americannand Latino communities,so that prison now stands firmly betweennthe young people trying to make it,and the fulfillment of the American Dream.,The problem's actually na bit worse than this,'cause we're not just sending npoor kids to prison,,we're saddling poor kids with court fees,,with probation and parole restrictions,,with low-level warrants,,we're asking them to live nin halfway houses and on house arrest,,and we're asking them nto negotiate a police force,that is entering poorncommunities of color,,not for the purposes nof promoting public safety,,but to make arrest counts,nto line city coffers. 
 This is the hidden underside to ournhistoric experiment in punishment:,young people worried that at any moment,nthey will be stopped, searched and seized.,Not just in the streets, nbut in their homes,,at school and at work. 
 I got interested in this nother path to adulthood,when I was myself a college student,attending the University of Pennsylvania,in the early 2000s.,Penn sits within a historic nAfrican-American neighborhood.,So you've got these two parallelnjourneys going on simultaneously:,the kids attending nthis elite, private university,,and the kids from nthe adjacent neighborhood,,some of whom are making it to college,,and many of whom nare being shipped to prison. 
 In my sophomore year, I started tutoringna young woman who was in high school,who lived about 10 minutesnaway from the university.,Soon, her cousin came home nfrom a juvenile detention center.,He was 15, a freshman in high school.,I began to get to know him nand his friends and family,,and I asked him what he thought nabout me writing about his life,for my senior thesis in college.,This senior thesis becamena dissertation at Princeton,and now a book. 
 By the end of my sophomore year,,I moved into the neighborhoodnand I spent the next six years 
 trying to understand what young peoplenwere facing as they came of age.,The first week I spentnin this neighborhood,,I saw two boys, five and seven years old,,play this game of chase,,where the older boynran after the other boy.,He played the cop.,When the cop caught upnto the younger boy,,he pushed him down,,handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,,took a quarter out of nthe other child's pocket,,saying, "I'm seizing that.",He asked the child if nhe was carrying any drugs,or if he had a warrant.,Many times, I saw this game repeated,,sometimes children would nsimply give up running,,and stick their bodies flat nagainst the ground,with their hands above their heads,nor flat up against a wall.,Children would yell at each other,,"I'm going to lock you up,,I'm going to lock you upnand you're never coming home!",Once I saw a six-year-old childnpull another child's pants down,and try to do a cavity search. 
 In the first 18 months that I livednin this neighborhood,,I wrote down every time I sawnany contact between police,and people that were my neighbors.,So in the first 18 months,,I watched the police stop npedestrians or people in cars,,search people, run people's names,,chase people through the streets,,pull people in for questioning,,or make an arrest every single day,nwith five exceptions.,Fifty-two times, I watched the policenbreak down doors,,chase people through houses,or make an arrest of someonenin their home.,Fourteen timesnin this first year and a half,,I watched the police punch, choke,nkick, stomp on or beat young men,after they had caught them. 
 Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,,Chuck and Tim.,Chuck was 18 when we met,na senior in high school.,He was playing on the basketball teamnand making C's and B's.,His younger brother, Tim, was 10.,And Tim loved Chuck;nhe followed him around a lot,,looked to Chuck to be a mentor.,They lived with their mom and grandfather,in a two-story row home nwith a front lawn and a back porch.,Their mom was struggling with addictionnall while the boys were growing up.,She never really was able nto hold down a job for very long.,It was their grandfather's pensionnthat supported the family,,not really enough to paynfor food and clothes,and school supplies for growing boys.,The family was really struggling. 
 So when we met, Chuck wasna senior in high school.,He had just turned 18.,That winter, a kid in the schoolyard,called Chuck's mom a crack whore.,Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow,and the school cops charged him nwith aggravated assault.,The other kid was fine the next day,,I think it was his pride that was injurednmore than anything. 
 But anyway, since Chuck was 18,,this agg. assault case sent him nto adult county jail,on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,,where he sat, unable to pay the bail --nhe couldn't afford it --,while the trial dates ndragged on and on and on,through almost his entire senior year.,Finally, near the end of this season,,the judge on this assault casenthrew out most of the charges,and Chuck came home,with only a few hundred dollars' worthnof court fees hanging over his head.,Tim was pretty happy that day. 
 The next fall, Chuck tried nto re-enroll as a senior,,but the school secretary told him that,he was then 19 and too old nto be readmitted.,Then the judge on his assault casenissued him a warrant for his arrest,because he couldn't pay nthe 225 dollars in court fees,that came due a few weeks afternthe case ended.,Then he was a high school dropoutnliving on the run. 
 Tim's first arrest came later that year,after he turned 11.,Chuck had managednto get his warrant lifted,and he was on a payment plannfor the court fees,and he was driving Tim to schoolnin his girlfriend's car.,So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,,and the car comes up nas stolen in California.,Chuck had no idea where in the historynof this car it had been stolen.,His girlfriend's uncle bought itnfrom a used car auction,in northeast Philly.,Chuck and Tim had never beennoutside of the tri-state,,let alone to California.,But anyway, the cops down at the precinct,charged Chuck with nreceiving stolen property.,And then a juvenile judge, na few days later,,charged Tim, age 11,,with accessory to receivingna stolen property,and then he was placed on nthree years of probation.,With this probation sentence nhanging over his head, 
 Chuck sat his little brother down,and began teaching himnhow to run from the police.,They would sit side by side non their back porch,looking out into the shared alleyway,and Chuck would coach Timnhow to spot undercover cars,,how to negotiate a late-night police raid,nhow and where to hide. 
 I want you to imagine for a second,what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like,if they were living in a neighborhoodnwhere kids were going to college,,not prison.,A neighborhood like the one nI got to grow up in.,Okay, you might say.,But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,nthey're committing crimes!,Don't they deserve to be in prison?,Don't they deserve to be nliving in fear of arrest?,Well, my answer would be no.,They don't.,And certainly not for the same things nthat other young people,with more privilege are doingnwith impunity.,If Chuck had gone to my high school,,that schoolyard fight nwould have ended there,,as a schoolyard fight.,It never would have becomenan aggravated assault case.,Not a single kid thatnI went to college with,has a criminal record right now.,Not a single one.,But can you imagine how many might havenif the police had stopped those kids,and searched their pockets for drugsnas they walked to class?,Or had raided their frat partiesnin the middle of the night? 
 Okay, you might say.,But doesn't this high incarceration rate,partly account for our nreally low crime rate?,Crime is down. That's a good thing.,Totally, that is a good thing.nCrime is down.,It dropped precipitously innthe '90s and through the 2000s.,But according to a committee of academics,convened by the National Academynof Sciences last year,,the relationship between ournhistorically high incarceration rates,and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.,It turns out that the crime ratengoes up and down,irrespective of how many young peoplenwe send to prison. 
 We tend to think about justicenin a pretty narrow way:,good and bad, innocent and guilty.,Injustice is about being nwrongfully convicted.,So if you're convicted nof something you did do,,you should be punished for it.,There are innocent and guilty people,,there are victims and nthere are perpetrators.,Maybe we could think a little bitnmore broadly than that. 
 Right now, we're asking kids who livenin the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,,who have the least amountnof family resources,,who are attending nthe country's worst schools,,who are facing the toughest timenin the labor market,,who are living in neighborhoodsnwhere violence is an everyday problem,,we're asking these kids to walknthe thinnest possible line --,to basically never do anything wrong. 
 Why are we not providing supportnto young kids facing these challenges?,Why are we offering only handcuffs,njail time and this fugitive existence?,Can we imagine something better?,Can we imagine a criminal justice systemnthat prioritizes recovery,,prevention, civic inclusion,,rather than punishment?,(Applause),A criminal justice system nthat acknowledges,the legacy of exclusion that poor peoplenof color in the U.S. have faced,and that does not promotenand perpetuate those exclusions.,(Applause),And finally, a criminal justice systemnthat believes in black young people,,rather than treating black young people nas the enemy to be rounded up.,(Applause) 
 The good news is that we already are.,A few years ago, Michelle Alexandernwrote "The New Jim Crow,",which got Americans to see nincarceration as a civil rights issue,of historic proportions in a waynthey had not seen it before.,President Obama and Attorney General nEric Holder have come out very strongly,on sentencing reform,,on the need to address nracial disparity in incarceration.,We're seeing states throw outnStop and Frisk,as the civil rights violation that it is.,We're seeing cities and statesndecriminalize possession of marijuana.,New York, New Jerseynand California,have been dropping their nprison populations, closing prisons,,while also seeing a big drop in crime.,Texas has gotten into the game now,,also closing prisons, ninvesting in education.,This curious coalition is building nfrom the right and the left,,made up of former prisonersnand fiscal conservatives,,of civil rights activistsnand libertarians,,of young people taking to the streetsnto protest police violence,against unarmed black teenagers,,and older, wealthier people --,some of you are here in the audience --,pumping big money into ndecarceration initiatives,In a deeply divided Congress,,the work of reforming nour criminal justice system,is just about the only thingnthat the right and the left,are coming together on. 
 I did not think I would seenthis political moment in my lifetime.,I think many of the peoplenwho have been working tirelessly,to write about the causes and consequences,of our historically nhigh incarceration rates,did not think we would seenthis moment in our lifetime.,The question for us now is,nhow much can we make of it?,How much can we change? 
 I want to end with a call to young people,,the young people attending college,and the young peoplenstruggling to stay out of prison,or to make it through prisonnand return home.,It may seem like these pathsnto adulthood are worlds apart,,but the young people participatingnin these two institutions,conveying us to adulthood,,they have one thing in common:,Both can be leaders in the worknof reforming our criminal justice system.,Young people have always been leadersnin the fight for equal rights,,the fight for more people nto be granted dignity,and a fighting chance at freedom.,The mission for the generation nof young people,coming of age in this, a sea-changenmoment, potentially,,is to end mass incarceration and nbuild a new criminal justice system,,emphasis on the word justice. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)I'm really excited to share with you,some findings that really surprise me,about what makes companies nsucceed the most,,what factors actually matter the mostnfor startup success. 
 I believe that the startup organization,is one of the greatest formsnto make the world a better place.,If you take a group of people nwith the right equity incentives,and organize them in a startup,,you can unlock human potentialnin a way never before possible.,You get them to achieve nunbelievable things. 
 But if the startup norganization is so great,,why do so many fail?,That's what I wanted to find out.,I wanted to find out whatnactually matters most,for startup success. 
 And I wanted to try nto be systematic about it,,avoid some of my instinctsnand maybe misperceptions I have,from so many companiesnI've seen over the years. 
 I wanted to know this,because I've been starting businessesnsince I was 12 years old,when I sold candy at the bus stopnin junior high school,,to high school, when I madensolar energy devices,,to college, when I made loudspeakers.,And when I graduated from college,nI started software companies.,And 20 years ago,nI started Idealab,,and in the last 20 years,nwe started more than 100 companies,,many successes, and many big failures.,We learned a lot from those failures. 
 So I tried to look across what factors,accounted the most for companynsuccess and failure.,So I looked at these five.,First, the idea.,I used to think that nthe idea was everything.,I named my company Idealabnfor how much I worship,the "aha!" moment when you firstncome up with the idea.,But then over time,,I came to think that maybe the team,nthe execution, adaptability,,that mattered even more than the idea. 
 I never thought I'd be quotingnboxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,,but he once said,,"Everybody has a plan, until they getnpunched in the face." (Laughter),And I think that's so truenabout business as well.,So much about a team's execution,is its ability to adapt to getting punchednin the face by the customer.,The customer is the true reality.,And that's why I came to think,that the team maybenwas the most important thing. 
 Then I started lookingnat the business model.,Does the company have a very clear pathngenerating customer revenues?,That started rising to the topnin my thinking,about maybe what matterednmost for success. 
 Then I looked at the funding.,Sometimes companies receivednintense amounts of funding.,Maybe that's the most important thing? 
 And then of course,nthe timing.,Is the idea way too early andnthe world's not ready for it?,Is it early, as in, you're in advancenand you have to educate the world?,Is it just right?,Or is it too late, and there'snalready too many competitors? 
 So I tried to look very carefullynat these five factors,across many companies.,And I looked across all 100nIdealab companies,,and 100 non-Idealab companies,to try and come up with nsomething scientific about it. 
 So first, on these Idealab companies,,the top five companies --,Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,nNetZero, Tickets.com --,those all became billion-dollar successes.,And the five companies on the bottom --,Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,nDesktop Factory, Peoplelink --,we all had high hopes for,nbut didn't succeed. 
 So I tried to rank across all nof those attributes,how I felt those companies scorednon each of those dimensions.,And then for non-Idealab companies,nI looked at wild successes,,like Airbnb and Instagram and Ubernand Youtube and LinkedIn. 
 And some failures:,Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com,Flooz and Friendster.,The bottom companies had intense funding,,they even had business modelsnin some cases,,but they didn't succeed.,I tried to look at what factorsnactually accounted the most,for success and failure acrossnall of these companies,,and the results really surprised me. 
 The number one thing was timing.,Timing accounted for 42 percent,of the differencenbetween success and failure.,Team and execution came in second,,and the idea,,the differentiability of the idea,nthe uniqueness of the idea,,that actually came in third. 
 Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,,it's not to say that nthe idea isn't important,,but it very much surprised me thatnthe idea wasn't the most important thing.,Sometimes it mattered more when nit was actually timed. 
 The last two, business model and funding,nmade sense to me actually.,I think business modelnmakes sense to be that low,because you can start outnwithout a business model,and add one later if your customersnare demanding what you're creating.,And funding, I think as well,,if you're underfunded at firstnbut you're gaining traction,,especially in today's age,,it's very, very easy to getnintense funding. 
 So now let me give you some specificnexamples about each of these.,So take a wild success like Airbnbnthat everybody knows about.,Well, that company was famouslynpassed on by many smart investors,because people thought,,"No one's going to rent out a spacenin their home to a stranger.",Of course, people proved that wrong.,But one of the reasons it succeeded,,aside from a good business model,na good idea, great execution,,is the timing. 
 That company came outnright during the height of the recession,when people really needed extra money,,and that maybe helped people overcome,their objection to renting outntheir own home to a stranger. 
 Same thing with Uber.,Uber came out,,incredible company,nincredible business model,,great execution, too.,But the timing was so perfect,for their need to get driversninto the system.,Drivers were looking for extra money;nit was very, very important. 
 Some of our early successes, Citysearch,ncame out when people needed web pages.,GoTo.com, which we announcednactually at TED in 1998,,was when companies were looking forncost-effective ways to get traffic.,We thought the idea was so great,,but actually, the timing was probablynmaybe more important.,And then some of our failures.,We started a company called Z.com,nit was an online entertainment company.,We were so excited about it --,we raised enough money,nwe had a great business model,,we even signed incredibly greatnHollywood talent to join the company.,But broadband penetrationnwas too low in 1999-2000.,It was too hard to watchnvideo content online,,you had to put codecs in your browsernand do all this stuff,,and the company eventuallynwent out of business in 2003. 
 Just two years later,,when the codec problemnwas solved by Adobe Flash,and when broadband penetrationncrossed 50 percent in America,,YouTube was perfectly timed.,Great idea, but unbelievable timing.,In fact, YouTube didn't even havena business model when it first started.,It wasn't even certain that nthat would work out.,But that was beautifully, nbeautifully timed. 
 So what I would say, in summary,,is execution definitely matters a lot.,The idea matters a lot.,But timing might matter even more.,And the best way to really assess timing,is to really look at whether nconsumers are really ready,for what you have to offer them.,And to be really, really honest about it,,not be in denial aboutnany results that you see,,because if you have something you love,nyou want to push it forward,,but you have to be very, very honestnabout that factor on timing. 
 As I said earlier,,I think startups can change the worldnand make the world a better place.,I hope some of these insights,can maybe help younhave a slightly higher success ratio,,and thus make something greatncome to the world,that wouldn't have happened otherwise. 
 Thank you very much,nyou've been a great audience. 
 (Applause)So if I told you thatnthis was the face of pure joy,,would you call me crazy?,I wouldn't blame you,,because every time I look at thisnArctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.,I want to tell youna little bit about this photograph. 
 I was swimming aroundnin the Lofoten Islands in Norway,,just inside the Arctic Circle,,and the water was hoveringnright at freezing.,The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,,and I could literally feel the bloodntrying to leave my hands,,feet and face, and rushnto protect my vital organs.,It was the coldest I've ever been.,But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes,nand cheeks flushed red,,I have found that this place right herenis somewhere I can find great joy. 
 Now, when it comes to pain,npsychologist Brock Bastian,probably said it best when he wrote,,"Pain is a kind of shortcutnto mindfulness.,It makes us suddenly awarenof everything in the environment.,It brutally draws us in,to a virtual sensory awarenessnof the world much like meditation." 
 If shivering is a form of meditation,nthen I would consider myself a monk.,(Laughter) 
 Now, before we get into the why,would anyone ever want to surfnin freezing cold water?,I would love to give youna little perspective,on what a day in my life can look like. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Man: I mean, I knownwe were hoping for good waves,,but I don't think anybody thoughtnthat was going to happen.,I can't stop shaking.,I am so cold. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Burkard: So,nsurf photographer, right?,I don't even knownif it's a real job title, to be honest.,My parents definitely didn't think so,when I told them at 19 I was quittingnmy job to pursue this dream career:,blue skies, warm tropical beaches,nand a tan that lasts all year long.,I mean, to me, this was it.nLife could not get any better.,Sweating it out, shooting surfersnin these exotic tourist destinations.,But there was just this one problem.,You see, the more time I spent travelingnto these exotic locations,,the less gratifying it seemed to be.,I set out seeking adventure,nand what I was finding was only routine.,It was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining,nand a constant cellular connection,that to me were all the trappingsnof places heavily touristed,in and out of the water,,and it didn't take longnfor me to start feeling suffocated. 
 I began craving wild, open spaces,,and so I set out to find the placesnothers had written off,as too cold, too remote,nand too dangerous to surf,,and that challenge intrigued me.,I began this sort of personal crusadenagainst the mundane,,because if there'snone thing I've realized,,it's that any career,,even one as seemingly glamorousnas surf photography,,has the danger of becoming monotonous. 
 So in my search to break upnthis monotony, I realized something:,There's only about a thirdnof the Earth's oceans that are warm,,and it's really just that thin bandnaround the equator.,So if I was going to find perfect waves,,it was probably goingnto happen somewhere cold,,where the seas are notoriously rough,,and that's exactly where I began to look.,And it was my first trip to Iceland,that I felt like I foundnexactly what I was looking for. 
 I was blown awaynby the natural beauty of the landscape,,but most importantly, I couldn't believenwe were finding perfect waves,in such a remote and ruggednpart of the world.,At one point, we got to the beach,only to find massive chunks of icenhad piled on the shoreline.,They created this barriernbetween us and the surf,,and we had to weave nthrough this thing like a maze,just to get out into the lineup.,and once we got there,,we were pushing aside these ice chunksntrying to get into waves.,It was an incredible experience,none I'll never forget,,because amidst those harsh conditions,,I felt like I stumbled ontonone of the last quiet places,,somewhere that I found a claritynand a connection with the world,I knew I would never findnon a crowded beach. 
 I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter),Cold water was constantly on my mind,,and from that point on,,my career focused on these types of harshnand unforgiving environments,,and it took me to places like Russia,nNorway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,,the Faroe Islands,nand a lot of places in between.,And one of my favorite thingsnabout these places,was simply the challenge andnthe creativity it took just to get there:,hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth,trying to pinpoint any remote stretchnof beach or reef we could actually get to.,And once we got there,nthe vehicles were just as creative:,snowmobiles, six-wheelnSoviet troop carriers,,and a couple of super-sketchynhelicopter flights.,(Laughter),Helicopters really scare me, by the way. 
 There was this one particularlynbumpy boat ride,up the coast of Vancouver Islandnto this kind of remote surf spot,,where we ended up watchingnhelplessly from the water,as bears ravaged our camp site.,They walked off with our foodnand bits of our tent,,clearly letting us know that wenwere at the bottom of the food chain,and that this was their spot, not ours.,But to me, that trip,was a testament to the wildnessnI traded for those touristy beaches. 
 Now, it wasn't until I travelednto Norway -- (Laughter) --,that I really learnednto appreciate the cold.,So this is the place,where some of the largest,nthe most violent storms in the world,send huge waves smashingninto the coastline.,We were in this tiny, remote fjord,njust inside the Arctic Circle.,It had a greater populationnof sheep than people,,so help if we needed itnwas nowhere to be found.,I was in the water ntaking pictures of surfers,,and it started to snow.,And then the temperature began to drop.,And I told myself, there's not a chancenyou're getting out of the water.,You traveled all this way, and this isnexactly what you've been waiting for:,freezing cold conditionsnwith perfect waves.,And although I couldn't even feelnmy finger to push the trigger,,I knew I wasn't getting out.,So I just did whatever I could.nI shook it off, whatever.,But that was the point that I felt,this wind gush throughnthe valley and hit me,,and what started as this light snowfallnquickly became a full-on blizzard,,and I started to losenperception of where I was.,I didn't know if I was driftingnout to sea or towards shore,,and all I could really make outnwas the faint sound of seagulls,and crashing waves. 
 Now, I knew this place had a reputationnfor sinking ships and grounding planes,,and while I was out there floating,nI started to get a little bit nervous.,Actually, I was totally freaking out --,(Laughter) -- and I wasnborderline hypothermic,,and my friends eventuallynhad to help me out of the water.,And I don't know if it wasndelirium setting in or what,,but they told me later,I had a smile on my face the entire time. 
 Now, it was this trip,and probably that exact experiencenwhere I really began to feel,like every photograph was precious,,because all of a sudden in that moment,nit was something I was forced to earn.,And I realized, all this shiveringnhad actually taught me something:,In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.,Anything that is worth pursuingnis going to require us to suffer,just a little bit,,and that tiny bit of sufferingnthat I did for my photography,,it added a value to my worknthat was so much more meaningful to me,than just trying to fillnthe pages of magazines.,See, I gave a piece of myselfnin these places,,and what I walked away with,was a sense of fulfillmentnI had always been searching for. 
 So I look back at this photograph.,It's easy to see frozen fingersnand cold wetsuits,and even the strugglenthat it took just to get there,,but most of all,nwhat I see is just joy. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Why do we cheat?,And why do happy people cheat?,And when we say "infidelity,"nwhat exactly do we mean?,Is it a hookup, a love story,npaid sex, a chat room,,a massage with a happy ending?,Why do we think that men cheatnout of boredom and fear of intimacy,,but women cheat out of lonelinessnand hunger for intimacy?,And is an affair alwaysnthe end of a relationship? 
 For the past 10 years,nI have traveled the globe,and worked extensivelynwith hundreds of couples,who have been shattered by infidelity.,There is one simple act of transgression,that can rob a couplenof their relationship,,their happiness and theirnvery identity: an affair.,And yet, this extremely commonnact is so poorly understood.,So this talk is for anyonenwho has ever loved. 
 Adultery has existednsince marriage was invented,,and so, too, the taboo against it.,In fact, infidelity has a tenacitynthat marriage can only envy,,so much so, that this isnthe only commandment,that is repeated twice in the Bible:,once for doing it, and oncenjust for thinking about it.,(Laughter),So how do we reconcilenwhat is universally forbidden,,yet universally practiced? 
 Now, throughout history, mennpractically had a license to cheat,with little consequence,,and supported by a hostnof biological and evolutionary theories,that justified their need to roam,,so the double standardnis as old as adultery itself.,But who knows what's really going onnunder the sheets there, right?,Because when it comes to sex,,the pressure for mennis to boast and to exaggerate,,but the pressure for womennis to hide, minimize and deny,,which isn't surprising when you considernthat there are still nine countries,where women can be killed for straying. 
 Now, monogamy used to benone person for life.,Today, monogamy is one person at a time.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 I mean, many of you probably have said,,"I am monogamous in all my relationships.",(Laughter) 
 We used to marry,,and had sex for the first time.,But now we marry,,and we stop having sex with others.,The fact is that monogamynhad nothing to do with love.,Men relied on women's fidelity,in order to know whose children these are,,and who gets the cows when I die. 
 Now, everyone wants to know,what percentage of people cheat.,I've been asked that questionnsince I arrived at this conference.,(Laughter),It applies to you.,But the definition of infidelitynkeeps on expanding:,sexting, watching porn, stayingnsecretly active on dating apps.,So because there is nonuniversally agreed-upon definition,of what even constitutes an infidelity,,estimates vary widely,nfrom 26 percent to 75 percent.,But on top of it, we arenwalking contradictions.,So 95 percent of us will saynthat it is terribly wrong,for our partner to lienabout having an affair,,but just about the samenamount of us will say,that that's exactly what wenwould do if we were having one.,(Laughter) 
 Now, I like this definitionnof an affair --,it brings together the three key elements:,a secretive relationship,nwhich is the core structure of an affair;,an emotional connectionnto one degree or another;,and a sexual alchemy.,And alchemy is the key word here,,because the erotic frisson is such thatnthe kiss that you only imagine giving,,can be as powerful and as enchanting,as hours of actual lovemaking.,As Marcel Proust said,,it's our imagination that is responsiblenfor love, not the other person. 
 So it's never been easier to cheat,,and it's never been morendifficult to keep a secret.,And never has infidelity exactednsuch a psychological toll.,When marriage was an economic enterprise,,infidelity threatenednour economic security.,But now that marriagenis a romantic arrangement,,infidelity threatensnour emotional security.,Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --,that was the space wherenwe sought pure love.,But now that we seek love in marriage,,adultery destroys it. 
 Now, there are three ways that I thinkninfidelity hurts differently today.,We have a romantic idealnin which we turn to one person,to fulfill an endless list of needs:,to be my greatest lover, my best friend,,the best parent, my trusted confidant,,my emotional companion,nmy intellectual equal.,And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,,I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,,I'm the one.,And infidelity tells me I'm not.,It is the ultimate betrayal.,Infidelity shattersnthe grand ambition of love.,But if throughout history,ninfidelity has always been painful,,today it is often traumatic,,because it threatens our sense of self. 
 So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.,He goes on: "I thought I knew my life.,I thought I knew who you were,nwho we were as a couple, who I was.,Now, I question everything.",Infidelity -- a violation of trust,na crisis of identity.,"Can I ever trust you again?" he asks.,"Can I ever trust anyone again?" 
 And this is also what my patientnHeather is telling me,,when she's talking to menabout her story with Nick.,Married, two kids.,Nick just left on a business trip,,and Heather is playingnon his iPad with the boys,,when she sees a messagenappear on the screen:,"Can't wait to see you.",Strange, she thinks,nwe just saw each other.,And then another message:,"Can't wait to hold you in my arms.",And Heather realizes,these are not for her.,She also tells menthat her father had affairs,,but her mother, she foundnone little receipt in the pocket,,and a little bit of lipsticknon the collar.,Heather, she goes digging,,and she finds hundreds of messages,,and photos exchangednand desires expressed.,The vivid detailsnof Nick's two-year affair,unfold in front of her in real time,,And it made me think:,Affairs in the digital agenare death by a thousand cuts. 
 But then we have another paradoxnthat we're dealing with these days.,Because of this romantic ideal,,we are relying on our partner'snfidelity with a unique fervor.,But we also have nevernbeen more inclined to stray,,and not because we have new desires today,,but because we live in an era,where we feel that we arenentitled to pursue our desires,,because this is the culturenwhere I deserve to be happy.,And if we used to divorcenbecause we were unhappy,,today we divorcenbecause we could be happier.,And if divorce carried all the shame,,today, choosing to stay when you can leave,is the new shame.,So Heather, she can't talk to her friends,because she's afraid that theynwill judge her for still loving Nick,,and everywhere she turns,nshe gets the same advice:,Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.,And if the situation were reversed,nNick would be in the same situation.,Staying is the new shame. 
 So if we can divorce,,why do we still have affairs?,Now, the typical assumptionnis that if someone cheats,,either there's something wrongnin your relationship or wrong with you.,But millions of peoplencan't all be pathological.,The logic goes like this: If younhave everything you need at home,,then there is no neednto go looking elsewhere,,assuming that there is suchna thing as a perfect marriage,that will inoculate us against wanderlust.,But what if passionnhas a finite shelf life?,What if there are thingsnthat even a good relationship,can never provide?,If even happy people cheat,,what is it about? 
 The vast majority of peoplenthat I actually work with,are not at all chronic philanderers.,They are often people who arendeeply monogamous in their beliefs,,and at least for their partner.,But they find themselves in a conflict,between their values and their behavior.,They often are people who havenactually been faithful for decades,,but one day they cross a line,that they never thought they would cross,,and at the risk of losing everything.,But for a glimmer of what?,Affairs are an act of betrayal,,and they are also an expressionnof longing and loss.,At the heart of an affair,nyou will often find,a longing and a yearningnfor an emotional connection,,for novelty, for freedom,nfor autonomy, for sexual intensity,,a wish to recapturenlost parts of ourselves,or an attempt to bring backnvitality in the face of loss and tragedy. 
 I'm thinking aboutnanother patient of mine, Priya,,who is blissfully married,,loves her husband,,and would never want to hurt the man.,But she also tells me,that she's always donenwhat was expected of her:,good girl, good wife, good mother,,taking care of her immigrant parents.,Priya, she fell for the arboristnwho removed the tree from her yard,after Hurricane Sandy.,And with his truck and his tattoos,nhe's quite the opposite of her.,But at 47, Priya's affair is aboutnthe adolescence that she never had.,And her story highlights for menthat when we seek the gaze of another,,it isn't always our partnernthat we are turning away from,,but the person thatnwe have ourselves become.,And it isn't so much that we'renlooking for another person,,as much as we arenlooking for another self. 
 Now, all over the world,,there is one word that peoplenwho have affairs always tell me.,They feel alive.,And they often will tell menstories of recent losses --,of a parent who died,,and a friend that went too soon,,and bad news at the doctor.,Death and mortality often livenin the shadow of an affair,,because they raise these questions.,Is this it? Is there more?,Am I going on for anothern25 years like this?,Will I ever feel that thing again?,And it has led me to thinknthat perhaps these questions,are the ones that propelnpeople to cross the line,,and that some affairs arenan attempt to beat back deadness,,in an antidote to death. 
 And contrary to what you may think,,affairs are way less about sex,nand a lot more about desire:,desire for attention,ndesire to feel special,,desire to feel important.,And the very structure of an affair,,the fact that you cannnever have your lover,,keeps you wanting.,That in itself is a desire machine,,because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,,keeps you wantingnthat which you can't have. 
 Now some of you probably think,that affairs don't happennin open relationships,,but they do.,First of all, the conversationnabout monogamy is not the same,as the conversation about infidelity.,But the fact is that it seemsnthat even when we have,the freedom to have other sexual partners,,we still seem to be lurednby the power of the forbidden,,that if we do that whichnwe are not supposed to do,,then we feel like we are reallyndoing what we want to.,And I've also toldnquite a few of my patients,that if they could bringninto their relationships,one tenth of the boldness,nthe imagination and the verve,that they put into their affairs,,they probably would never need to see me.,(Laughter) 
 So how do we heal from an affair?,Desire runs deep.,Betrayal runs deep.,But it can be healed.,And some affairs are death knells,for relationships that werenalready dying on the vine.,But others will jolt usninto new possibilities.,The fact is, the majority of couples,who have experiencednaffairs stay together.,But some of them will merely survive,,and others will actually be ablento turn a crisis into an opportunity.,They'll be able to turn thisninto a generative experience.,And I'm actually thinking evennmore so for the deceived partner,,who will often say,,"You think I didn't want more?,But I'm not the one who did it.",But now that the affair is exposed,,they, too, get to claim more,,and they no longer havento uphold the status quo,that may not have been workingnfor them that well, either. 
 I've noticed that a lot of couples,,in the immediate aftermath of an affair,,because of this new disordernthat may actually lead to a new order,,will have depths of conversationsnwith honesty and openness,that they haven't had in decades.,And, partners who werensexually indifferent,find themselves suddenlynso lustfully voracious,,they don't know where it's coming from.,Something about the fearnof loss will rekindle desire,,and make way for an entirelynnew kind of truth. 
 So when an affair is exposed,,what are some of the specific thingsnthat couples can do?,We know from trauma that healing begins,when the perpetratornacknowledges their wrongdoing.,So for the partner who had the affair,,for Nick,,one thing is to end the affair,,but the other is the essential,nimportant act of expressing,guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.,But the truth is,that I have noticed that quite a lotnof people who have affairs,may feel terribly guiltynfor hurting their partner,,but they don't feel guiltynfor the experience of the affair itself.,And that distinction is important.,And Nick, he needs to holdnvigil for the relationship.,He needs to become, for a while,nthe protector of the boundaries.,It's his responsibility to bring it up,,because if he thinks about it,,he can relieve Heather from the obsession,,and from having to make surenthat the affair isn't forgotten,,and that in itselfnbegins to restore trust. 
 But for Heather,,or deceived partners,,it is essential to do thingsnthat bring back a sense of self-worth,,to surround oneself with lovenand with friends and activities,that give back joynand meaning and identity.,But even more important,,is to curb the curiositynto mine for the sordid details --,Where were you? Where did you do it?,How often? Is she betternthan me in bed? --,questions that only inflict more pain,,and keep you awake at night.,And instead, switch to what I callnthe investigative questions,,the ones that minenthe meaning and the motives --,What did this affair mean for you?,What were you able to expressnor experience there,that you could no longer do with me?,What was it like for younwhen you came home?,What is it about us that you value?,Are you pleased this is over? 
 Every affair will redefine a relationship,,and every couple will determine,what the legacy of the affair will be.,But affairs are here to stay,nand they're not going away.,And the dilemmas of love and desire,,they don't yield just simple answersnof black and white and good and bad,,and victim and perpetrator.,Betrayal in a relationshipncomes in many forms.,There are many waysnthat we betray our partner:,with contempt, with neglect,,with indifference, with violence.,Sexual betrayal is onlynone way to hurt a partner.,In other words, the victim of an affair,is not always the victim of the marriage. 
 Now, you've listened to me,,and I know what you're thinking:,She has a French accent,nshe must be pro-affair.,(Laughter),So, you're wrong.,I am not French.,(Laughter),(Applause),And I'm not pro-affair.,But because I think that goodncan come out of an affair,,I have often been askednthis very strange question:,Would I ever recommend it?,Now, I would no morenrecommend you have an affair,than I would recommend you have cancer,,and yet we know that peoplenwho have been ill,often talk about how their illnessnhas yielded them a new perspective.,The main question that I've been askednsince I arrived at this conference,when I said I would talknabout infidelity is, for or against?,I said, "Yes.",(Laughter) 
 I look at affairs from a dual perspective:,hurt and betrayal on one side,,growth and self-discovery on the other --,what it did to you,nand what it meant for me.,And so when a couple comes to menin the aftermath of an affair,that has been revealed,,I will often tell them this:,Today in the West,,most of us are going to haventwo or three relationships,or marriages,,and some of us are goingnto do it with the same person.,Your first marriage is over.,Would you like to createna second one together? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've learned some ofnmy most important life lessons,from drug dealers,and gang members,and prostitutes,,and I've had some of my mostnprofound theological conversations,not in the hallowed halls of a seminary,but on a street corner,on a Friday night, at 1 a.m. 
 That's a little unusual, since I amna Baptist minister, seminary-trained,,and pastored a church for over 20 years,,but it's true.,It came as a part of my participation,in a public safetyncrime reduction strategy,that saw a 79 percent reductionnin violent crime,over an eight-year period in a major city. 
 But I didn't start out wanting to be,a part of somebody'sncrime reduction strategy.,I was 25, had my first church.,If you would have asked menwhat my ambition was,,I would have told younI wanted to be a megachurch pastor.,I wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.,I wanted my own television ministry.,I wanted my own clothing line.,(Laughter),I wanted to be your long distance carrier.,You know, the whole nine yards.,(Laughter) 
 After about a year of pastoring,,my membership went up about 20 members.,So megachurchdom was way down the road.,But seriously, if you'd have said,n"What is your ambition?",I would have said just to bena good pastor,,to be able to be with peoplenthrough all the passages of life,,to preach messages that would havenan everyday meaning for folks,,and in the African-American tradition,,to be able to representnthe community that I serve. 
 But there was something elsenthat was happening in my city,and in the entire metro area,,and in most metro areasnin the United States,,and that was the homicide ratenstarted to rise precipitously.,And there were young peoplenwho were killing each other,for reasons that I thoughtnwere very trivial,,like bumping into someonenin a high school hallway,,and then after school,nshooting the person.,Someone with the wrong color shirt on,,on the wrong street cornernat the wrong time.,And something needednto be done about that.,It got to the point where it startednto change the character of the city.,You could go to any housing project,,for example, like the one that wasndown the street from my church,,and you would walk in,nand it would be like a ghost town,,because the parents wouldn't allowntheir kids to come out and play,,even in the summertime,nbecause of the violence.,You would listen in the neighborhoodsnon any given night,,and to the untrained ear,nit sounded like fireworks,,but it was gunfire.,You'd hear it almost every night,nwhen you were cooking dinner,,telling your child a bedtime story,nor just watching TV.,And you can go to any emergencynroom at any hospital,,and you would see lying on gurneys,young black and Latino mennshot and dying.,And I was doing funerals,,but not of the venerated matriarchsnand patriarchs who'd lived a long life,and there's a lot to say.,I was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,,17-year-olds,,and 16-year-olds,,and I was standing in a churchnor at a funeral home,struggling to say something,that would make some meaningful impact.,And so while my colleagues were buildingnthese cathedrals great and tall,and buying property outside of the city,and moving their congregations out,so that they could createnor recreate their cities of God,,the social structures in the inner cities,were sagging under the weightnof all of this violence. 
 And so I stayed, because somebodynneeded to do something,,and so I had looked at what I hadnand moved on that.,I started to preach decryingnthe violence in the community.,And I started to looknat the programming in my church,,and I started to build programsnthat would catch the at-risk youth,,those who were on the fencento the violence.,I even tried to be innovativenin my preaching.,You all have heard of rap music, right?,Rap music?,I even tried to rap sermon one time.,It didn't work, but at least I tried it.,I'll never forget the young personnwho came to me after that sermon.,He waited until everybody was gone,,and he said, "Rev, rap sermon, huh?"nAnd I was like, "Yeah, what do you think?",And he said, "Don't do that again, Rev.",(Laughter) 
 But I preached and I built these programs,,and I thought maybe ifnmy colleagues did the same,that it would make a difference.,But the violence justncareened out of control,,and people who were not involved innthe violence were getting shot and killed:,somebody going to buy a packnof cigarettes at a convenience store,,or someone who was sittingnat a bus stop just waiting for a bus,,or kids who were playing in the park,,oblivious to the violencenon the other side of the park,,but it coming and visiting them.,Things were out of control,,and I didn't know what to do,,and then something happenednthat changed everything for me.,It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,,walking home with his friendnRigoberto Carrion,to the housing projectndown the street from my church.,They met up with a group of youthnwho were from a gang in Dorchester,,and they were killed.,But as Jesse was runningnfrom the scene mortally wounded,,he was running in the directionnof my church,,and he died some 100, 150 yards away.,If he would have gotten to the church,nit wouldn't have made a difference,,because the lights were out;nnobody was home.,And I took that as a sign.,When they caught some of the youthnthat had done this deed,,to my surprise, they were around my age,,but the gulf that was between us was vast.,It was like we were in twoncompletely different worlds. 
 And so as I contemplated all of this,and looked at what was happening,,I suddenly realized that there wasna paradox that was emerging inside of me,,and the paradox was this:nin all of those sermons,that I preached decrying the violence,,I was also talking aboutnbuilding community,,but I suddenly realized,that there was a certainnsegment of the population,that I was not includingnin my definition of community.,And so the paradox was this:,If I really wanted the communitynthat I was preaching for,,I needed to reach out,and embrace this groupnthat I had cut out of my definition.,Which meant not about building programs,to catch those who werenon the fences of violence,,but to reach out and to embrace thosenwho were committing the acts of violence,,the gang bangers, the drug dealers. 
 As soon as I came to that realization,na quick question came to my mind.,Why me?,I mean, isn't this a lawnenforcement issue?,This is why we have the police, right?,As soon as the question, "Why me?" came,nthe answer came just as quickly:,Why me? Because I'm the one whoncan't sleep at night thinking about it.,Because I'm the one looking around sayingnsomebody needs to do something about this,,and I'm starting to realizenthat that someone is me.,I mean, isn't that hownmovements start anyway?,They don't start with a grand conventionnand people coming together,and then walking in lockstepnwith a statement.,But it starts with just a few,nor maybe just one. 
 It started with me that way,,and so I decided to figure outnthe culture of violence,in which these young peoplenwho were committing them existed,,and I started to volunteernat the high school.,After about two weeksnof volunteering at the high school,,I realized that the youthnthat I was trying to reach,,they weren't going to high school.,I started to walk in the community,,and it didn't take a rocket scientistnto realize that they weren't out,during the day.,So I started to walk the streetsnat night, late at night,,going into the parks where they were,,building the relationshipnthat was necessary. 
 A tragedy happened in Bostonnthat brought a number of clergy together,,and there was a small cadre of usnwho came to the realization,that we had to come outnof the four walls of our sanctuary,and meet the youth where they were,,and not try to figure outnhow to bring them in.,And so we decided to walk together,,and we would get together,in one of the most dangerousnneighborhoods in the city,on a Friday night and on a Saturday night,at 10 p.m.,,and we would walknuntil 2 or 3 in the morning.,I imagine we were quite the anomalynwhen we first started walking.,I mean, we weren't drug dealers.,We weren't drug customers.,We weren't the police. Some of usnwould have collars on.,It was probably a really odd thing.,But they started speakingnto us after a while,,and what we found out is that,while we were walking,nthey were watching us,,and they wanted to make surenof a couple of things:,that number one, we were goingnto be consistent in our behavior,,that we would keep coming out there;,and then secondly,nthey had wanted to make sure,that we weren't out there to exploit them.,Because there was alwaysnsomebody who would say,,"We're going to take back the streets,",but they would always seem to havena television camera with them,,or a reporter,,and they would enhancentheir own reputation,to the detriment of those on the streets.,So when they saw that we had none of that,,they decided to talk to us.,And then we didnan amazing thing for preachers.,We decided to listen and not preach.,Come on, give it up for me.,(Laughter) (Applause),All right, come on, you're cuttingninto my time now, okay? (Laughter),But it was amazing.,We said to them, "We don't knownour own communities after 9 p.m. at night,,between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,,but you do.,You are the subject matter experts,nif you will, of that period of time.,So talk to us. Teach us.,Help us to see what we're not seeing.,Help us to understandnwhat we're not understanding.",And they were all too happy to do that,,and we got an idea of what lifenon the streets was all about,,very different than what you seenon the 11 o'clock news,,very different than what is portrayednin popular media and even social media. 
 And as we were talking with them,,a number of myths were dispellednabout them with us.,And one of the biggest myths wasnthat these kids were cold and heartless,and uncharacteristically boldnin their violence.,What we found out was the exact opposite.,Most of the young peoplenwho were out there on the streets,are just trying to make it on the streets.,And we also found out,that some of the mostnintelligent and creative,and magnificent and wise,people that we've ever met,were on the street,nengaged in a struggle.,And I know some of them call it survival,nbut I call them overcomers,,because when you're innthe conditions that they're in,,to be able to live every daynis an accomplishment of overcoming.,And as a result of that, we said to them,,"How do you see this church,nhow do you see this institution,helping this situation?",And we developed a plannin conversation with these youths.,We stopped looking at themnas the problem to be solved,,and we started looking at themnas partners, as assets,,as co-laborers in the strugglento reduce violence in the community.,Imagine developing a plan,,you have one minister at one tablenand a heroin dealer at the other table,,coming up with a way in which the churchncan help the entire community. 
 The Boston Miracle was aboutnbringing people together.,We had other partners.,We had law enforcement partners.,We had police officers.,It wasn't the entire force,,because there were still some who stillnhad that lock-'em-up mentality,,but there were other cops,who saw the honor in partneringnwith the community,,who saw the responsibility from themselves,to be able to work as partnersnwith community leaders and faith leaders,in order to reduce violencenin the community.,Same with probation officers,,same with judges,,same with folks who werenup that law enforcement chain,,because they realized, like we did,,that we'll never arrest ourselvesnout of this situation,,that there will not benenough prosecutions made,,and you cannot fill these jails up enough,in order to alleviate the problem.,I helped to start an organization,20 years ago, a faith-based organization,nto deal with this issue.,I left it about four years ago,and started working in citiesnacross the United States,,19 in total,,and what I found outnwas that in those cities,,there was always this componentnof community leaders,who put their heads downnand their nose to the grindstone,,who checked their egos at the door,and saw the whole as greaternthan the sum of its parts,,and came together and found waysnto work with youth out on the streets,,that the solution is not more cops,,but the solution is mining the assetsnthat are there in the community,,to have a strong community component,in the collaborationnaround violence reduction. 
 Now, there is a movementnin the United States,of young people who I am very proud ofnwho are dealing with the structural issues,that need to change if we're goingnto be a better society.,But there is this political ploynto try to pit police brutality,and police misconductnagainst black-on-black violence.,But it's a fiction.,It's all connected.,When you think about decadesnof failed housing policies,and poor educational structures,,when you think aboutnpersistent unemployment,and underemployment in a community,,when you think about poor healthcare,,and then you throw drugs into the mix,and duffel bags full of guns,,little wonder that you would seenthis culture of violence emerge.,And then the response that comesnfrom the state is more cops,and more suppression of hot spots.,It's all connected,,and one of the wonderful thingsnthat we've been able to do,is to be able to show the valuenof partnering together --,community, law enforcement,nprivate sector, the city --,in order to reduce violence.,You have to valuenthat community component. 
 I believe that we can endnthe era of violence in our cities.,I believe that it is possiblenand that people are doing it even now.,But I need your help.,It can't just come from folksnwho are burning themselves out,in the community.,They need support. They need help.,Go back to your city.,Find those people.,"You need some help? I'll help you out.",Find those people. They're there.,Bring them together with law enforcement,nthe private sector, and the city,,with the one aim of reducing violence,,but make sure thatnthat community component is strong.,Because the old adagenthat comes from Burundi is right:,that you do for me,nwithout me, you do to me. 
 God bless you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm turning 44 next month,,and I have the sense that 44nis going to be a very good year,,a year of fulfillment, realization.,I have that sense,,not because of anythingnparticular in store for me,,but because I read it would be a good year,in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer. 
 "He felt his own age, forty-four ...",wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,","... felt as if he were a solid embodiment,of bone, muscle, heart, mind,nand sentiment to be a man,,as if he had arrived." 
 Yes, I know Mailernwasn't writing about me.,But I also know that he was;,for all of us -- you, me,nthe subject of his book,,age more or less in step,,proceed from birthnalong the same great sequence:,through the wondersnand confinements of childhood;,the emancipationsnand frustrations of adolescence;,the empowermentsnand millstones of adulthood;,the recognitionsnand resignations of old age.,There are patterns to life,,and they are shared.,As Thomas Mann wrote:n"It will happen to me as to them." 
 We don't simply live these patterns.,We record them, too.,We write them down in books,nwhere they become narratives,that we can then read and recognize.,Books tell us who we've been,,who we are, who we will be, too.,So they have for millennia.,As James Salter wrote,,"Life passes into pagesnif it passes into anything." 
 And so six years ago,na thought leapt to mind:,if life passed into pages,nthere were, somewhere,,passages written about every age.,If I could find them, I couldnassemble them into a narrative.,I could assemble them into a life,,a long life, a hundred-year life,,the entirety of that same great sequence,through which the luckiest among us pass.,I was then 37 years old,,"an age of discretion,"nwrote William Trevor.,I was prone to meditating on time and age.,An illness in the familynand later an injury to me,had long made clear that growing oldncould not be assumed.,And besides, growing oldnonly postponed the inevitable,,time seeing throughnwhat circumstance did not.,It was all a bit disheartening. 
 A list, though, would last.,To chronicle a lifenyear by vulnerable year,would be to clasp and to groundnwhat was fleeting,,would be to provide myself and othersna glimpse into the future,,whether we made it there or not.,And when I then began to compile my list,nI was quickly obsessed,,searching pages and pagesnfor ages and ages.,Here we were at every annual stepnthrough our first hundred years.,"Twenty-seven ... a timenof sudden revelations,","sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments." 
 I was mindful, of course,nthat such insights were relative.,For starters, we now live longer,nand so age more slowly.,Christopher Isherwood usednthe phrase "the yellow leaf",to describe a man at 53,,only one century after Lord Byronnused it to describe himself at 36. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was mindful, too, that lifencan swing wildly and unpredictably,from one year to the next,,and that people may experiencenthe same age differently.,But even so, as the list coalesced,,so, too, on the page, clearnas the reflection in the mirror,,did the life that I had been living:,finding at 20 that "... one is lessnand less sure of who one is;",emerging at 30 from the "... wastelandnof preparation into active life;",learning at 40 "... to close softlynthe doors to rooms,[I would] not be coming back to.",There I was. 
 Of course, there we all are.,Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer,whose beautifulnvisualizations you see here,,and who today is 85 --,all those years "... a ripeningnand an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov --,noted to me that, like art and like color,,literature helps us to remembernwhat we've experienced. 
 And indeed, when I sharednthe list with my grandfather,,he nodded in recognition.,He was then 95 and soon to die,,which, wrote Roberto Bolaño,,"... is the same as never dying.",And looking back, he said to me that, yes,,Proust was right that at 22,nwe are sure we will not die,,just as a thanatologistnnamed Edwin Shneidman was right,that at 90, we are sure we will.,It had happened to him,,as to them. 
 Now the list is done:,a hundred years.,And looking back over it,,I know that I am not done.,I still have my life to live,,still have many more pages to pass into.,And mindful of Mailer,,I await 44. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You're looking at a womannwho was publicly silent for a decade.,Obviously, that's changed,,but only recently. 
 It was several months ago,that I gave my very firstnmajor public talk,at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:,1,500 brilliant people,nall under the age of 30.,That meant that in 1998,,the oldest among the group were only 14,,and the youngest, just four.,I joked with them that somenmight only have heard of me,from rap songs.,Yes, I'm in rap songs.,Almost 40 rap songs. (Laughter) 
 But the night of my speech,na surprising thing happened.,At the age of 41, I was hit onnby a 27-year-old guy.,I know, right?,He was charming and I was flattered,,and I declined.,You know what hisnunsuccessful pickup line was?,He could make me feel 22 again.,(Laughter) (Applause),I realized later that night,nI'm probably the only person over 40,who does not want to be 22 again.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 At the age of 22,nI fell in love with my boss,,and at the age of 24,,I learned the devastating consequences. 
 Can I see a show of hands of anyone here,who didn't make a mistakenor do something they regretted at 22?,Yep. That's what I thought.,So like me, at 22, a few of younmay have also taken wrong turns,and fallen in love with the wrong person,,maybe even your boss.,Unlike me, though, your boss,probably wasn't the presidentnof the United States of America.,Of course, life is full of surprises. 
 Not a day goes by that I'm notnreminded of my mistake,,and I regret that mistake deeply. 
 In 1998, after having been swept upninto an improbable romance,,I was then swept up into the eyenof a political, legal and media maelstrom,like we had never seen before.,Remember, just a few years earlier,,news was consumed from just three places:,reading a newspaper or magazine,,listening to the radio,,or watching television.,That was it.,But that wasn't my fate.,Instead, this scandal was brought to you,by the digital revolution.,That meant we could accessnall the information we wanted,,when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,,and when the story broke in January 1998,,it broke online.,It was the first time the traditional news,was usurped by the Internetnfor a major news story,,a click that reverberatednaround the world. 
 What that meant for me personally,was that overnight I wentnfrom being a completely private figure,to a publicly humiliated one worldwide.,I was patient zeronof losing a personal reputation,on a global scale almost instantaneously. 
 This rush to judgment,nenabled by technology,,led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.,Granted, it was before social media,,but people could still comment online,,email stories, and, of course,nemail cruel jokes.,News sources plasterednphotos of me all over,to sell newspapers, banner ads online,,and to keep people tuned to the TV.,Do you recall a particular image of me,,say, wearing a beret? 
 Now, I admit I made mistakes,,especially wearing that beret.,But the attention and judgmentnthat I received, not the story,,but that I personally received,nwas unprecedented.,I was branded as a tramp,,tart, slut, whore, bimbo,,and, of course, that woman.,I was seen by many,but actually known by few.,And I get it: it was easy to forget,that that woman was dimensional,,had a soul, and was once unbroken. 
 When this happened to me 17 years ago,nthere was no name for it.,Now we call it cyberbullyingnand online harassment.,Today, I want to sharensome of my experience with you,,talk about how that experience has helpednshape my cultural observations,,and how I hope my past experiencencan lead to a change that results,in less suffering for others. 
 In 1998, I lost my reputationnand my dignity.,I lost almost everything,,and I almost lost my life. 
 Let me paint a picture for you.,It is September of 1998.,I'm sitting in a windowless office room,inside the Officenof the Independent Counsel,underneath humming fluorescent lights.,I'm listening to the sound of my voice,,my voice on surreptitiouslyntaped phone calls,that a supposed friendnhad made the year before.,I'm here becausenI've been legally required,to personally authenticatenall 20 hours of taped conversation.,For the past eight months,nthe mysterious content of these tapes,has hung like the Swordnof Damocles over my head.,I mean, who can remembernwhat they said a year ago?,Scared and mortified, I listen,,listen as I prattle onnabout the flotsam and jetsam of the day;,listen as I confess my lovenfor the president,,and, of course, my heartbreak;,listen to my sometimes catty,nsometimes churlish, sometimes silly self,being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;,listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,,to the worst version of myself,,a self I don't even recognize. 
 A few days later, the Starr Reportnis released to Congress,,and all of those tapes and transcripts,nthose stolen words, form a part of it.,That people can read the transcriptsnis horrific enough,,but a few weeks later,,the audio tapes are aired on TV,,and significant portionsnmade available online.,The public humiliation was excruciating.,Life was almost unbearable. 
 This was not something that happenednwith regularity back then in 1998,,and by this, I mean the stealingnof people's private words, actions,,conversations or photos,,and then making them public --,public without consent,,public without context,,and public without compassion. 
 Fast forward 12 years to 2010,,and now social media has been born.,The landscape has sadly become muchnmore populated with instances like mine,,whether or not someonenactually make a mistake,,and now it's for both publicnand private people.,The consequences for somenhave become dire, very dire. 
 I was on the phone with my mom,in September of 2010,,and we were talking about the news,of a young college freshmannfrom Rutgers University,named Tyler Clementi.,Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler,was secretly webcammed by his roommate,while being intimate with another man.,When the online worldnlearned of this incident,,the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.,A few days later,,Tyler jumped from nthe George Washington Bridge,to his death.,He was 18. 
 My mom was beside herself aboutnwhat happened to Tyler and his family,,and she was gutted with pain,in a way that I just couldn'tnquite understand,,and then eventually I realized,she was reliving 1998,,reliving a time when she satnby my bed every night,,reliving a time when she made me showernwith the bathroom door open,,and reliving a timenwhen both of my parents feared,that I would be humiliated to death,,literally. 
 Today, too many parents,haven't had the chance to step innand rescue their loved ones.,Too many have learnednof their child's suffering and humiliation,after it was too late.,Tyler's tragic, senseless deathnwas a turning point for me.,It served to recontextualizenmy experiences,,and I then began to look at the worldnof humiliation and bullying around me,and see something different.,In 1998, we had no way of knowingnwhere this brave new technology,called the Internet would take us.,Since then, it has connected peoplenin unimaginable ways,,joining lost siblings,,saving lives, launching revolutions,,but the darkness, cyberbullying,nand slut-shaming that I experienced,had mushroomed.,Every day online, people,nespecially young people,who are not developmentallynequipped to handle this,,are so abused and humiliated,that they can't imagine livingnto the next day,,and some, tragically, don't,,and there's nothing virtual about that.,ChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focusednon helping young people on various issues,,released a staggering statisticnlate last year:,From 2012 to 2013,,there was an 87 percent increase,in calls and emails relatednto cyberbullying.,A meta-analysis donenout of the Netherlands,showed that for the first time,,cyberbullying was leadingnto suicidal ideations,more significantly than offline bullying.,And you know what shocked me,nalthough it shouldn't have,,was other research last yearnthat determined humiliation,was a more intensely felt emotion,than either happiness or even anger. 
 Cruelty to others is nothing new,,but online, technologicallynenhanced shaming is amplified,,uncontained, and permanently accessible.,The echo of embarrassment used to extendnonly as far as your family, village,,school or community,,but now it's the online community too.,Millions of people, often anonymously,,can stab you with their words,nand that's a lot of pain,,and there are no perimetersnaround how many people,can publicly observe you,and put you in a public stockade.,There is a very personal price,to public humiliation,,and the growth of the Internetnhas jacked up that price. 
 For nearly two decades now,,we have slowly been sowing the seedsnof shame and public humiliation,in our cultural soil,nboth on- and offline.,Gossip websites, paparazzi,nreality programming, politics,,news outlets and sometimes hackersnall traffic in shame.,It's led to desensitizationnand a permissive environment online,which lends itself to trolling,ninvasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.,This shift has creatednwhat Professor Nicolaus Mills calls,a culture of humiliation.,Consider a few prominent examplesnjust from the past six months alone.,Snapchat, the service which is usednmainly by younger generations,and claims that its messagesnonly have the lifespan,of a few seconds.,You can imagine the rangenof content that that gets.,A third-party app which Snapchattersnuse to preserve the lifespan,of the messages was hacked,,and 100,000 personal conversations,nphotos, and videos were leaked online,to now have a lifespan of forever.,Jennifer Lawrence and several other actorsnhad their iCloud accounts hacked,,and private, intimate, nude photosnwere plastered across the Internet,without their permission.,One gossip websitenhad over five million hits,for this one story.,And what about the Sony Picturesncyberhacking?,The documents which receivednthe most attention,were private emails that hadnmaximum public embarrassment value. 
 But in this culture of humiliation,,there is another kind of price tagnattached to public shaming.,The price does not measurenthe cost to the victim,,which Tyler and too many others,,notably women, minorities,,and members of the LGBTQncommunity have paid,,but the price measures the profitnof those who prey on them.,This invasion of others is a raw material,,efficiently and ruthlessly mined,npackaged and sold at a profit.,A marketplace has emergednwhere public humiliation is a commodity,and shame is an industry.,How is the money made?,Clicks.,The more shame, the more clicks.,The more clicks,nthe more advertising dollars.,We're in a dangerous cycle.,The more we click on this kind of gossip,,the more numb we getnto the human lives behind it,,and the more numb we get,nthe more we click.,All the while, someone is making money,off of the back nof someone else's suffering.,With every click, we make a choice.,The more we saturate our culturenwith public shaming,,the more accepted it is,,the more we will see behaviornlike cyberbullying,,trolling, some forms of hacking,,and online harassment.,Why? Because they all havenhumiliation at their cores.,This behavior is a symptomnof the culture we've created.,Just think about it. 
 Changing behavior beginsnwith evolving beliefs.,We've seen that to be truenwith racism, homophobia,,and plenty of other biases,ntoday and in the past.,As we've changed beliefsnabout same-sex marriage,,more people have beennoffered equal freedoms.,When we began valuing sustainability,,more people began to recycle.,So as far as our culturenof humiliation goes,,what we need is a cultural revolution.,Public shamingnas a blood sport has to stop,,and it's time for an interventionnon the Internet and in our culture. 
 The shift begins with something simple,nbut it's not easy.,We need to return to a long-held valuenof compassion -- compassion and empathy.,Online, we've got a compassion deficit,,an empathy crisis. 
 Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,,"Shame can't survive empathy.",Shame cannot survive empathy.,I've seen some very dark days in my life,,and it was the compassion and empathynfrom my family, friends, professionals,,and sometimes even strangersnthat saved me.,Even empathy from one personncan make a difference.,The theory of minority influence,,proposed by social psychologistnSerge Moscovici,,says that even in small numbers,,when there's consistency over time,,change can happen.,In the online world,nwe can foster minority influence,by becoming upstanders.,To become an upstander meansninstead of bystander apathy,,we can post a positive comment for someonenor report a bullying situation.,Trust me, compassionate commentsnhelp abate the negativity.,We can also counteract the culturenby supporting organizations,that deal with these kinds of issues,,like the Tyler ClementinFoundation in the U.S.,,In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,,and in Australia, there's Project Rockit. 
 We talk a lot about our rightnto freedom of expression,,but we need to talk more about,our responsibilitynto freedom of expression.,We all want to be heard,,but let's acknowledge the differencenbetween speaking up with intention,and speaking up for attention.,The Internet is nthe superhighway for the id,,but online, showing empathy to others,benefits us all and helps createna safer and better world.,We need to communicatenonline with compassion,,consume news with compassion,,and click with compassion.,Just imagine walking a milenin someone else's headline.,I'd like to end on a personal note.,In the past nine months,,the question I've been nasked the most is why.,Why now? Why was I nsticking my head above the parapet?,You can read between the linesnin those questions,,and the answer has nothingnto do with politics.,The top note answer was and isnbecause it's time:,time to stop tip-toeing around my past;,time to stop living a life of opprobrium;,and time to take back my narrative. 
 It's also not just about saving myself.,Anyone who is suffering from shamenand public humiliation,needs to know one thing:,You can survive it.,I know it's hard.,It may not be painless, quick or easy,,but you can insistnon a different ending to your story.,Have compassion for yourself.,We all deserve compassion,,and to live both online and offnin a more compassionate world. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)Two twin domes,,two radically opposed design cultures.,One is made of thousands of steel parts,,the other of a single silk thread.,One is synthetic, the other organic.,One is imposed on the environment,,the other creates it.,One is designed for nature,nthe other is designed by her. 
 Michelangelo said thatnwhen he looked at raw marble,,he saw a figure struggling to be free.,The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.,But living things are not chiseled.,They grow.,And in our smallest units of life,nour cells, we carry all the information,that's required for every other cellnto function and to replicate. 
 Tools also have consequences.,At least since the Industrial Revolution,nthe world of design has been dominated,by the rigors of manufacturingnand mass production.,Assembly lines have dictatedna world made of parts,,framing the imaginationnof designers and architects,who have been trained to thinknabout their objects as assemblies,of discrete parts with distinct functions. 
 But you don't find homogenousnmaterial assemblies in nature.,Take human skin, for example.,Our facial skins are thinnwith large pores.,Our back skins are thicker,nwith small pores.,One acts mainly as filter,,the other mainly as barrier,,and yet it's the same skin:nno parts, no assemblies.,It's a system that graduallynvaries its functionality,by varying elasticity.,So here this is a split screennto represent my split world view,,the split personality of every designernand architect operating today,between the chisel and the gene,,between machine and organism,nbetween assembly and growth,,between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.,These two worldviews,nmy left brain and right brain,,analysis and synthesis, will play outnon the two screens behind me.,My work, at its simplest level,,is about uniting these two worldviews,,moving away from assembly,and closer into growth. 
 You're probably asking yourselves:,Why now?,Why was this not possible 10nor even five years ago?,We live in a very special time in history,,a rare time,,a time when the confluence of four fieldsnis giving designers access to tools,we've never had access to before.,These fields are computational design,,allowing us to designncomplex forms with simple code;,additive manufacturing,nletting us produce parts,by adding materialnrather than carving it out;,materials engineering, which lets usndesign the behavior of materials,in high resolution;,and synthetic biology,,enabling us to design new biologicalnfunctionality by editing DNA.,And at the intersectionnof these four fields,,my team and I create.,Please meet the minds and hands,of my students. 
 We design objects and productsnand structures and tools across scales,,from the large-scale,,like this robotic armnwith an 80-foot diameter reach,with a vehicular base that willnone day soon print entire buildings,,to nanoscale graphics made entirelynof genetically engineered microorganisms,that glow in the dark.,Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,,an archetype of ancientnArabic architecture,,and created a screen wherenevery aperture is uniquely sized,to shape the form of light and heatnmoving through it. 
 In our next project,,we explore the possibilitynof creating a cape and skirt --,this was for a Paris fashion shownwith Iris van Herpen --,like a second skinnthat are made of a single part,,stiff at the contours,nflexible around the waist.,Together with my long-termn3D printing collaborator Stratasys,,we 3D-printed this cape and skirtnwith no seams between the cells,,and I'll show more objects like it.,This helmet combinesnstiff and soft materials,in 20-micron resolution.,This is the resolution of a human hair.,It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.,That designers have access,to such high-resolutionnanalytic and synthetic tools,,enables to design products that fitnnot only the shape of our bodies,,but also the physiologicalnmakeup of our tissues.,Next, we designed an acoustic chair,,a chair that would be at oncenstructural, comfortable,and would also absorb sound.,Professor Carter, my collaborator, and Inturned to nature for inspiration,,and by designing this irregularnsurface pattern,,it becomes sound-absorbent.,We printed its surfacenout of 44 different properties,,varying in rigidity, opacity and color,,corresponding to pressure pointsnon the human body.,Its surface, as in nature,nvaries its functionality,not by adding another materialnor another assembly,,but by continuously and delicatelynvarying material property. 
 But is nature ideal?,Are there no parts in nature?,I wasn't raisednin a religious Jewish home,,but when I was young,,my grandmother used to tell menstories from the Hebrew Bible,,and one of them stuck with me and camento define much of what I care about.,As she recounts:,"On the third day of Creation,nGod commands the Earth,to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree.",For this first fruit tree,nthere was to be no differentiation,between trunk, branches,nleaves and fruit.,The whole tree was a fruit.,Instead, the land grew treesnthat have bark and stems and flowers.,The land created a world made of parts.,I often ask myself,,"What would design be likenif objects were made of a single part?,Would we return to a betternstate of creation?" 
 So we looked for that biblical material,,that fruit-bearing fruit treenkind of material, and we found it.,The second-most abundant biopolymernon the planet is called chitin,,and some 100 million tons of itnare produced every year,by organisms such as shrimps,ncrabs, scorpions and butterflies.,We thought if we could tunenits properties,,we could generate structuresnthat are multifunctional,out of a single part.,So that's what we did.,We called Legal Seafood -- 
 (Laughter) 
 we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,,we grinded themnand we produced chitosan paste.,By varying chemical concentrations,,we were able to achievena wide array of properties --,from dark, stiff and opaque,,to light, soft and transparent.,In order to print the structuresnin large scale,,we built a robotically controllednextrusion system with multiple nozzles.,The robot would varynmaterial properties on the fly,and create these 12-foot-long structuresnmade of a single material,,100 percent recyclable.,When the parts are ready,nthey're left to dry,and find a form naturallynupon contact with air.,So why are we stillndesigning with plastics?,The air bubbles that were a byproductnof the printing process,were used to containnphotosynthetic microorganisms,that first appeared on our planetn3.5 billion year ago,,as we learned yesterday.,Together with our collaboratorsnat Harvard and MIT,,we embedded bacterianthat were genetically engineered,to rapidly capture carbonnfrom the atmosphere,and convert it into sugar.,For the first time,,we were able to generate structuresnthat would seamlessly transition,from beam to mesh,,and if scaled even larger, to windows.,A fruit-bearing fruit tree.,Working with an ancient material,,one of the first lifeforms on the planet,,plenty of water and a little bitnof synthetic biology,,we were able to transform a structurenmade of shrimp shells,into an architecturenthat behaves like a tree.,And here's the best part:,for objects designed to biodegrade,,put them in the sea,nand they will nourish marine life;,place them in soil,nand they will help grow a tree. 
 The setting for our next explorationnusing the same design principles,was the solar system.,We looked for the possibilitynof creating life-sustaining clothing,for interplanetary voyages.,To do that, we needed to contain bacterianand be able to control their flow.,So like the periodic table, we came upnwith our own table of the elements:,new lifeforms thatnwere computationally grown,,additively manufactured,and biologically augmented.,I like to think of synthetic biologynas liquid alchemy,,only instead of transmutingnprecious metals,,you're synthesizing new biologicalnfunctionality inside very small channels.,It's called microfluidics.,We 3D-printed our own channelsnin order to control the flow,of these liquid bacterial cultures.,In our first piece of clothing,nwe combined two microorganisms.,The first is cyanobacteria.,It lives in our oceansnand in freshwater ponds.,And the second, E. coli, the bacteriumnthat inhabits the human gut.,One converts light into sugar,nthe other consumes that sugar,and produces biofuelsnuseful for the built environment.,Now, these two microorganismsnnever interact in nature.,In fact, they never met each other.,They've been here,nengineered for the first time,,to have a relationshipninside a piece of clothing.,Think of it as evolutionnnot by natural selection,,but evolution by design.,In order to contain these relationships,,we've created a single channelnthat resembles the digestive tract,,that will help flow these bacterianand alter their function along the way.,We then started growingnthese channels on the human body,,varying material propertiesnaccording to the desired functionality.,Where we wanted more photosynthesis,nwe would design more transparent channels.,This wearable digestive system,nwhen it's stretched end to end,,spans 60 meters.,This is half the lengthnof a football field,,and 10 times as longnas our small intestines.,And here it is for the first timenunveiled at TED --,our first photosynthetic wearable,,liquid channels glowing with lifeninside a wearable clothing. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashionedncreatures, but only half made up.",What if design could providenthat other half?,What if we could create structuresnthat would augment living matter?,What if we could createnpersonal microbiomes,that would scan our skins,nrepair damaged tissue,and sustain our bodies?,Think of this as a form of edited biology.,This entire collection, Wanderers,nthat was named after planets,,was not to me really about fashion per se,,but it provided an opportunitynto speculate about the future,of our race on our planet and beyond,,to combine scientific insightnwith lots of mystery,and to move awaynfrom the age of the machine,to a new age of symbiosisnbetween our bodies,,the microorganisms that we inhabit,,our products and even our buildings.,I call this material ecology. 
 To do this, we always neednto return back to nature.,By now, you know that a 3D printernprints material in layers.,You also know that nature doesn't.,It grows. It adds with sophistication.,This silkworm cocoon, for example,,creates a highlynsophisticated architecture,,a home inside which to metamorphisize.,No additive manufacturing today gets evennclose to this level of sophistication.,It does so by combining not two materials,,but two proteinsnin different concentrations.,One acts as the structure,nthe other is the glue, or the matrix,,holding those fibers together.,And this happens across scales.,The silkworm first attaches itselfnto the environment --,it creates a tensile structure --,and it then starts spinningna compressive cocoon.,Tension and compression,nthe two forces of life,,manifested in a single material. 
 In order to better understandnhow this complex process works,,we glued a tiny earth magnet,to the head of a silkworm,nto the spinneret.,We placed it inside a boxnwith magnetic sensors,,and that allowed us to createnthis 3-dimensional point cloud,and visualize the complex architecturenof the silkworm cocoon.,However, when we placednthe silkworm on a flat patch,,not inside a box,,we realized it would spin a flat cocoon,and it would stillnhealthily metamorphisize.,So we started designing differentnenvironments, different scaffolds,,and we discovered thatnthe shape, the composition,,the structure of the cocoon, was directlyninformed by the environment. 
 Silkworms are often boiled to deathninside their cocoons,,their silk unraveled and usednin the textile industry.,We realized that designing these templatesnallowed us to give shape to raw silk,without boiling a single cocoon. 
 (Applause) 
 They would healthily metamorphisize,,and we would be ablento create these things. 
 So we scaled this process upnto architectural scale.,We had a robot spinnthe template out of silk,,and we placed it on our site.,We knew silkworms migratedntoward darker and colder areas,,so we used a sun path diagramnto reveal the distribution,of light and heat on our structure.,We then created holes, or apertures,,that would lock in the raysnof light and heat,,distributing those silkwormsnon the structure. 
 We were ready to receive the caterpillars.,We ordered 6,500 silkwormsnfrom an online silk farm.,And after four weeks of feeding,nthey were ready to spin with us.,We placed them carefullynat the bottom rim of the scaffold,,and as they spin they pupate,nthey mate, they lay eggs,,and life begins all over again --njust like us but much, much shorter. 
 Bucky Fuller said that tensionnis the great integrity,,and he was right.,As they spin biological silknover robotically spun silk,,they give this entirenpavilion its integrity.,And over two to three weeks,,6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.,In a curious symmetry, this is alsonthe length of the Silk Road.,The moths, after they hatch,nproduce 1.5 million eggs.,This could be used for 250nadditional pavilions for the future. 
 So here they are, the two worldviews.,One spins silk out of a robotic arm,,the other fills in the gaps. 
 If the final frontier of designnis to breathe life into the products,and the buildings around us,,to form a two-material ecology,,then designers must unitenthese two worldviews.,Which brings us back, of course,nto the beginning.,Here's to a new age of design,na new age of creation,,that takes us fromna nature-inspired design,to a design-inspired nature,,and that demands of us for the first time,that we mother nature. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)About 10 years ago, I went throughna little bit of a hard time.,So I decided to go see a therapist.,I had been seeing her for a few months,nwhen she looked at me one day and said,,"Who actually raised younuntil you were three?",Seemed like a weird question.nI said, "My parents.",And she said, "I don't thinknthat's actually the case;,because if it were,,we'd be dealing with things that arenfar more complicated than just this." 
 It sounded like the setup to a joke,nbut I knew she was serious.,Because when I first started seeing her,,I was trying to benthe funniest person in the room.,And I would try and crack these jokes,nbut she caught on to me really quickly,,and whenever I tried to make a joke,nshe would look at me and say,,"That is actually really sad.",(Laughter),It's terrible. 
 So I knew I had to be serious,nand I asked my parents,who had actually raised menuntil I was three?,And to my surprise, they said,my primary caregiver had beenna distant relative of the family.,I had called her my auntie. 
 I remember my auntie so clearly,,it felt like she had been part of my lifenwhen I was much older.,I remember the thick, straight hair,,and how it would come aroundnme like a curtain,when she bent to pick me up;,her soft, southern Thai accent;,the way I would cling to her,,even if she just wanted to gonto the bathroom,or get something to eat.,I loved her, but [with] the ferocitynthat a child has sometimes,before she understands that lovenalso requires letting go. 
 But my clearest and sharpestnmemory of my auntie,,is also one of my firstnmemories of life at all.,I remember her being beaten and slappednby another member of my family.,I remember screaming hystericallynand wanting it to stop,,as I did every single time it happened,,for things as minor as wantingnto go out with her friends,,or being a little late.,I became so hysterical over her treatment,,that eventually, she was justnbeaten behind closed doors. 
 Things got so bad for hernthat eventually she ran away.,As an adult, I learned later,that she had been just 19nwhen she was brought over from Thailand,to the States to care for me,non a tourist visa.,She wound up workingnin Illinois for a time,,before eventually returning to Thailand,,which is where I ran into her again,nat a political rally in Bangkok.,I clung to her again, as I hadnwhen I was a child,,and I let go, and thennI promised that I would call.,I never did, though.,Because I was afraid if I saidneverything that she meant to me --,that I owed perhaps the best partsnof who I became to her care,,and that the words "I'm sorry"nwere like a thimble,to bail out all the guiltnand shame and rage I felt,over everything she had endurednto care for me for as long as she had --,I thought if I said those words to her,nI would never stop crying again.,Because she had saved me.,And I had not saved her. 
 I'm a journalist, and I've been writingnand researching human trafficking,for the past eight years or so,,and even so, I never put togethernthis personal story,with my professional lifenuntil pretty recently.,I think this profound disconnectnactually symbolizes,most of our understandingnabout human trafficking.,Because human trafficking is far morenprevalent, complex and close to home,than most of us realize. 
 I spent time in jails and brothels,,interviewed hundreds of survivorsnand law enforcement, NGO workers.,And when I think about what we've donenabout human trafficking,,I am hugely disappointed.,Partly because we don't even talknabout the problem right at all.,When I say "human trafficking,",most of you probably don't thinknabout someone like my auntie.,You probably thinknabout a young girl or woman,,who's been brutally forcedninto prostitution by a violent pimp.,That is real suffering,nand that is a real story.,That story makes me angry,for far more than just the realitynof that situation, though. 
 As a journalist, I really care about hownwe relate to each other through language,,and the way we tell that story,nwith all the gory, violent detail,,the salacious aspects -- I call thatn"look at her scars" journalism.,We use that story to convince ourselves,that human trafficking is a bad manndoing a bad thing to an innocent girl.,That story lets us off the hook.,It takes away all the societal contextnthat we might be indicted for,,for the structural inequality,nor the poverty,,or the barriers to migration.,We let ourselves think,that human trafficking is onlynabout forced prostitution,,when in reality,,human trafficking is embeddednin our everyday lives. 
 Let me show you what I mean.,Forced prostitution accounts forn22 percent of human trafficking.,Ten percent is in state-nimposed forced labor.,but a whopping 68 percentnis for the purpose of creating the goods,and delivering the servicesnthat most of us rely on every day,,in sectors like agricultural work,ndomestic work and construction.,That is food and care and shelter.,And somehow, these most essential workers,are also among the world's most underpaidnand exploited today.,Human trafficking is the usenof force, fraud or coercion,to compel another person's labor.,And it's found in cotton fields,nand coltan mines,,and even car washes in Norway and England.,It's found in U.S. militarynbases in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 It's found in Thailand's fishing industry.,That country has become the largestnexporter of shrimp in the world.,But what are the circumstances,behind all that cheapnand plentiful shrimp?,Thai military were caught sellingnBurmese and Cambodian migrants,onto fishing boats.,Those fishing boats were taken out,nthe men put to work,,and they were thrown overboardnif they made the mistake of falling sick,,or trying to resist their treatment.,Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,,The shrimp were then soldnto four major global retailers:,Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour. 
 Human trafficking is foundnon a smaller scale than just that,,and in places you wouldnnever even imagine.,Traffickers have forced young peoplento drive ice cream trucks,,or to sing in touring boys' choirs.,Trafficking has even been foundnin a hair braiding salon in New Jersey. 
 The scheme in that case was incredible.,The traffickers found young familiesnwho were from Ghana and Togo,,and they told these families thatn"your daughters are going to get,a fine education in the United States.",They then located winnersnof the green card lottery,,and they told them, "We'll help you out.,We'll get you a plane ticket.nWe'll pay your fees.,All you have to do is takenthis young girl with you,,say that she's your sister or your spouse.,Once everyone arrived in New Jersey,nthe young girls were taken away,,and put to work for 14-hour days,,seven days a week, for five years.,They made their traffickersnnearly four million dollars. 
 This is a huge problem.,So what have we done about it?,We've mostly turnednto the criminal justice system.,But keep in mind, most victims of humanntrafficking are poor and marginalized.,They're migrants, people of color.,Sometimes they're in the sex trade.,And for populations like these,,the criminal justice system isntoo often part of the problem,,rather than the solution.,In study after study, in countries rangingnfrom Bangladesh to the United States,,between 20 and 60 percent of the peoplenin the sex trade who were surveyed,said that they had been raped or assaultednby the police in the past year alone.,People in prostitution, including peoplenwho have been trafficked into it,,regularly receive multiplenconvictions for prostitution.,Having that criminal record makes itnso much more difficult,to leave poverty, leave abuse,nor leave prostitution,,if that person so desires.,Workers outside of the sex sector --,if they try and resist their treatment,nthey risk deportation.,In case after case I've studied,nemployers have no problem,calling on law enforcementnto try and threaten or deport,their striking trafficked workers.,If those workers run away,,they risk becoming part of the great massnof undocumented workers,who are also subject to the whimsnof law enforcement if they're caught. 
 Law enforcement is supposed to identifynvictims and prosecute traffickers.,But out of an estimated 21 million victimsnof human trafficking in the world,,they have helped and identifiednfewer than 50,000 people.,That's like comparing,the population of the worldnto the population of Los Angeles,,proportionally speaking.,As for convictions, out of an estimatedn5,700 convictions in 2013,,fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.,Keep in mind that labor trafficking,accounts for 68 percentnof all trafficking,,but fewer than 10 percentnof the convictions. 
 I've heard one expert say that traffickingnhappens where need meets greed.,I'd like to add one more element to that.,Trafficking happens in sectors wherenworkers are excluded from protections,,and denied the right to organize.,Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.,It happens in systematicallyndegraded work environments.,You might be thinking,,oh, she's talking about failed states,nor war-torn states, or --,I'm actually talkingnabout the United States.,Let me tell you what that looks like. 
 I spent many months researchingna trafficking case called Global Horizons,,involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.,They were sent all over the States,nto work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,,and Washington apple orchards,nand anywhere the work was needed.,They were promised three yearsnof solid agricultural work.,So they made a calculated risk.,They sold their land, they soldntheir wives' jewelry,,to make thousands in recruitment feesnfor this company, Global Horizons.,But once they were brought over,,their passports were confiscated.,Some of the men were beatennand held at gunpoint.,They worked so hardnthey fainted in the fields.,This case hit me so hard. 
 After I came back home,,I was wandering through the grocery store,nand I froze in the produce department.,I was remembering the over-the-top mealsnthe Global Horizons survivors,would make for me every timenI showed up to interview them.,They finished one meal with this platenof perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,,and as they handed them to me, they said,,"Aren't these the kind of strawberriesnyou eat with somebody special,in the States?,And don't they taste so much better,when you know the peoplenwhose hands picked them for you?" 
 As I stood in that grocery store weeksnlater, I realized I had no idea,of who to thank for this plenty,,and no idea of hownthey were being treated.,So, like the journalist I am, I startedndigging into the agricultural sector.,And I found there are too many fields,nand too few labor inspectors.,I found multiple layersnof plausible deniability,between grower and distributornand processor, and God knows who else.,The Global Horizons survivors had beennbrought to the States,on a temporary guest worker program.,That guest worker programnties a person's legal status,to his or her employer,,and denies that workernthe right to organize.,Mind you, none of what I am describingnabout this agricultural sector,or the guest worker programnis actually human trafficking.,It is merely what we findnlegally tolerable.,And I would argue this isnfertile ground for exploitation.,And all of this had been hidden to me,nbefore I had tried to understand it. 
 I wasn't the only personngrappling with these issues.,Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,,is one of the biggest anti-traffickingnphilanthropists in the world.,And even he wound up accidentallyninvesting nearly 10 million dollars,in the pineapple plantation citednas having the worst working conditions,in that Global Horizons case.,When he found out, he and his wifenwere shocked and horrified,,and they wound up writingnan op-ed for a newspaper,,saying that it was up to all of usnto learn everything we can,about the labor and supply chainsnof the products that we support.,I totally agree. 
 What would happennif each one of us decided,that we are no longer goingnto support companies,if they don't eliminate exploitationnfrom their labor and supply chains?,If we demanded laws calling for the same?,If all the CEOs out there decided,that they were going to go throughntheir businesses and say, "no more"?,If we ended recruitment feesnfor migrant workers?,If we decided that guest workersnshould have the right to organize,without fear of retaliation?,These would be decisions heardnaround the world.,This isn't a matter of buyingna fair-trade peach,and calling it a day, buyingna guilt-free zone with your money.,That's not how it works.,This is the decision to changena system that is broken,,and that we have unwittingly but willingly,allowed ourselves to profit fromnand benefit from for too long. 
 We often dwell on human traffickingnsurvivors' victimization.,But that is not my experience of them.,Over all the years that I'venbeen talking to them,,they have taught me that we arenmore than our worst days.,Each one of us is morenthan what we have lived through.,Especially trafficking survivors.,These people were the most resourcefulnand resilient and responsible,in their communities.,They were the people that younwould take a gamble on.,You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings,nbecause I have the chance,to send you off to a better future.,They were the emissaries of hope. 
 These survivors don't need saving.,They need solidarity,nbecause they're behind,some of the most excitingnsocial justice movements out there today.,The nannies and housekeepersnwho marched with their families,and their employers' families --,their activism got usnan international treaty,on domestic workers' rights.,The Nepali women who were traffickedninto the sex trade --,they came together, and they decided,that they were going to make the world'snfirst anti-trafficking organization,actually headed and runnby trafficking survivors themselves.,These Indian shipyard workersnwere trafficked,to do post-Hurricane Katrinanreconstruction.,They were threatened with deportation,nbut they broke out of their work compound,and they marched from New Orleansnto Washington, D.C.,,to protest labor exploitation.,They cofounded an organization callednthe National Guest Worker Alliance,,and through this organization,nthey have wound up helping other workers,bring to light exploitationnand abuses in supply chains,in Walmart and Hershey's factories.,And although the Departmentnof Justice declined to take their case,,a team of civil rights lawyers wonnthe first of a dozen civil suits,this February, and gotntheir clients 14 million dollars. 
 These survivors are fightingnfor people they don't even know yet,,other workers, and for the possibilitynof a just world for all of us.,This is our chance to do the same.,This is our chance to make the decision,that tells us who we are,nas a people and as a society;,that our prosperity is nonlonger prosperity,,as long as it is pinnednto other people's pain;,that our lives areninextricably woven together;,and that we have the powernto make a different choice. 
 I was so reluctant to sharenmy story of my auntie with you.,Before I started this TED processnand climbed up on this stage,,I had told literally a handfulnof people about it,,because, like many a journalist,,I am far more interested in learningnabout your stories,than sharing much,nif anything, about my own.,I also haven't done my journalisticndue diligence on this.,I haven't issued my mountainsnof document requests,,and interviewed everyone and their mother,,and I haven't found my auntie yet.,I don't know her storynof what happened, and of her life now.,The story as I've told it to younis messy and unfinished.,But I think it mirrors the messynand unfinished situation we're all in,,when it comes to human trafficking.,We are all implicated in this problem.,But that means we are allnalso part of its solution.,Figuring out how to build a morenjust world is our work to do,,and our story to tell.,So let us tell it the waynwe should have done,,from the very beginning.,Let us tell this story together. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)This is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date.",It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel,"nwhich I did on Broadway,,and this one, I -- thank you --,I've excerpted it just for you,nso here we go. 
 Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain,all electronic devices are switched offnbefore we begin.,So class, hopefully you'll recognizenwhat you just heard me say as the -- ?,Very good, the cellularnphone announcement.,Right? This was also knownnas a mobile phone.,So you'll remember, people of that era,would have had an externalnelectronic device, right,,something like this,,and they all would have carriednone of these around with them,,and amongst their biggest fearsnwas the sheer mortification,that one of these might ringnat some inopportune moment.,Right? So a bit of trivianabout that era for you.,(Laughter) 
 So the format of today's class is,I will be presenting multiplenBERT modules today,from that period in history, right,,so starting circa 2016.,And remember, this wasnthe very first year of the BERT program.,So we've got quite a fewnof these to get through.,Bear in mind, I will be livingninto various different bodies,,different ages,,also what were then called races,nor ethnic groups,,as you'll remember from Unit 1.,And -- (Laughter) -- and alongnthe gender continuum,,I will be living into males as well.,It was quite binary at that time.,(Laughter),Also, don't forget, we are readingnthe book module,for next week's focus on gender.,Now, I know some of younhave requested the book in pill form.,I know people still believeningesting it is better for retention,,but since we are trying to experiencenwhat our forebears did, right,,let's please just consider doingnthe actual ocular reading, okay?,And also, how many peoplenhave your emotional shunts engaged?,Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?,I know it's challenging, but I want younto be able to feel the entire,natural emo range, all right?,It is essential to thisnpart of the syllabus.,Yes, Macy?,All right. I understand.nIf you're unwilling to --,All right, well, we can discussnthat after class.,All right, we will discuss your concerns.,Just relax. Nobody's diednand gone to composting.,Okay. After class. Okay? After class.,Let's just get started, okay.,This first subject identifiednas a middle-class homemaker.,Remember, these early modules,in these people's full identitiesnwere protected,,and this allowed them to speaknmore freely on our topic,,which for many of them was taboo. 
 Okay honey, now,nI'm ready when you are.,No, sweetheart, I said,nI'm ready when you are.,I'm freezing.,It's like a meat locker in herenin this recording studio.,I should have brought a shmata.,All this fancy technologynbut they can't afford heat.,What is he saying? I can't hear you!,I can't hear younthrough the glass, honey!,There you are in my ear.,Oh, you can hear me?,The whole time.,Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.,Yes, oh the cold is for the machines,nthe new technology. Okay.,Yes, now remind me again, you're recordingnnot only my voice but my feelings,and my memories? Right.,Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.,Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.,Right, right, so people will be ablento feel my experience,and my memory? Okay.,No, right, I'm ready.,I just thought you were going to give mena test to see how my memory's doing.,I was going to tell you you're too late,nit's already bad news.,No, no, go ahead, honey. 
 Oh, that's the first question?,What do I think of prostitution?,Are you soliciting me, young man?,I've heard of May-December romances,nbut what are you, about 20 years old?,Eighteen? Eighteen years.,I think I have candies in my pursenolder than 18 years old.,(Laughter),I'm teasing you, sweetheart.nNo, I'm comfortable with any question.,Sure. So about the prostitution --noh, sex worker, sex worker.,No, just in my day, they called itnprostitution, not sex work.,Oh, because it includes pornography also?,Okay.,No, well, I guess when I was a girl,,we didn't really havena name for that either.,We would have said dirty magazines,nI suppose, or dirty movies.,Well, it's not like what you havenwith the Internet.,No, well, I don't mind sharing.,My late husband and I,nwe were a very romantic couple.,Lots of tenderness, you understand.,Well, as you get older, you know,nat one point I thought my husband,might be helped by usingnsome of the pills men can take,,but he wasn't interested in those,,so I thought, what about maybenwatching an adult movie on the Internet?,Just for inspiration, you understand.,Well, at the time, neither of usnwere very good on the computer,,so usually, if we needed helpnwith the Internet,,we would just call our childrennor our grandchildren,,but obviously, in this case,nthat wasn't an option,,so I thought, I'll havena look myself, just to see.,How difficult could it be?,You search for certain key wordsnand you look --,Oh wow is right, young man.,You can't imagine what I saw.,Well, first of all, I was just tryingnto find, you know, couples,,normal couples making love,,but this, so many peoplentogether at one time.,You couldn't tell which partnbelonged to which body.,How they even got the cameras toncapture some of this, I couldn't tell you.,But the one thing they didn't capturenwas making love.,There was lots of making of something,,but they took the love partnright out of it, you know, the fun.,It was all very extreme, you know?,Like you would say,nwith the extreme sports.,Lots of endurance,,but never tenderness.,So anyway, needless to say,nthat was $19.95 I'll never get back again,,but it only showed up on the credit cardnas "entertainment services,",so my husband was never the wiser,,and after all of that,,well, you could say it turned out,he didn't need the extraninspiration after all. 
 Right, so next subject is a young womann-- (Applause) --,Next subject, class,nis a young woman called Bella,,a university student interviewed in 2016,during what was callednan Intro to Feminist Porn class,as part of her major in sex worknat a college in the Bay Area.,(Laughter) 
 Yeah, I just want to, like,nget a recording of, like,,you guys recording me,,like a meta recording, or whatever.,It's just like this whole experiencenis just, like, really amazing,,and I'd like to capture thatnfor, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.,So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,,and I am, like, beingninterviewed right now,for this, like, really amazingnBio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,,which is, like, basically where they are,nlike, recording, as you can see,from these, whatever, like, electrodes,,the formation of, like, neuropeptidesnin my hippocampus, or whatever.,They will later be ablento reconstitute these,as, like, my own actual memory,nlike actual experiences,,so other people can, like,nactually feel what I'm feeling right now.,Okay. Okay. 
 So, like, hello, BERT person of the futurenwho is experiencing me.,This is what it feels like to be,nlike, a college freshman,,and also the, like, headachenthat you are experiencing through me,is the, like, residual effectnof the Jell-O shots which I had last night,at the bi-weekly feministnpole dancing party,which I cohost on Wednesdays.,It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" --n(Laughter) --,and it's in Beekman Hall,,and, what else, like,,non-Jell-O shots are alsonavailable for vegans,,and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, wenshould also focus on your questions also. 
 So for your record, I am, like,na sex work studies major,but minoring in social media,with a concentrationnon notable YouTube memes.,(Laughter),Yes, well, of course, like,nI consider myself to be, like,,obviously, like, a feminist.,I was named for Bella Abzug,nwho was, like, a famous, like,,feminist from history,,and, like, also I feel that it is, like,nimportant to, like, represent women,who are, like, sex-positive feminists.,What is sex-negative?,Well, like, I guess I would ask,nlike, what do you think,sex-negative is? (Laughter),Yeah, because, like, the terms that we usenare, like, so important, because, like,,we call it sex work because it helpsnpeople understand that, like, it's work,,and, like, you know, just like there are,nlike, healthcare providers,and, like, insurance providers,,like, we think of these workersnas, like, sex care providers.,Yeah, but like, I don't think of myselfnlike, providing direct,sex care services per se as, like,nbeing a requirement,for me to be, like, an advocate.,Like, I support other women's rightnto choose it voluntarily, like,,if they enjoy it.,Yeah, but, like, I seenmyself going forward,as more likely, like,nprotecting sex workers',,like, legal freedoms and rights.,Yeah, so, like, basically,nI'm planning on becoming a lawyer. 
 Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause),So these next two modulesnare also circa 2016.,One subject is an Irishwomannwith a particularly noteworthy,relationship to this issue,,but first will be a West Indian woman,,a self-described escort,who was recorded at ansex workers' rights rally and parade.,She was interviewed whilst marchingnin full carnival headdress,and very little else. 
 All right, you want mento start talking now.,Yeah, I told you, you cannput those wires anywhere you want to,as long as it don't get in the way.,Yeah, no, but, tell me againnwhat the name of -- BERT? BERT.,Yeah, I was telling you, you know,nI think I have in all my time,I have had at least one client with thatnname, so this won't be the first time,I had BERT all over me.,Oh, I'm sorry,,but you got to get into the spirit of itnif you're going to interview me.,All right? You can say it.,No justice, no piece!nNo justice, no piece!,But you see the sign? You get it?nP-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.,You understand? 
 Right, so that's the partnwhere I was telling you,is that when I first came to this country,nI worked every job I could find.,I was a nanny; I was a home care attendantnfor all these different old people,,and then I said, child, if I have to touchnanother white man's backside,,I might as well get paidna lot more money for it than this,,you understand?,Pshh, you know how hard it isnbeing a domestic worker?,Some of these men, they're heavy.,You have to pick them upnand flip them over.,Now, I let them pick me upnand flip me over, you understand?,Well, you have to have a sense of humornabout it, that's what I think.,No, but see, listen,,you find me somebody who don't hatensome part of their job.,I mean, there's a lot of thingsnabout this job that I hate,,but the money is not one of them,,and I will tell you, as long as thisnis the best possibility,for me to make real money,,I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin'nif that's what they want to call me.,No, I'm not even from Jamaica.nThat's how they market me.,My family is from Trinidadnand the Virgin Islands.,They don't know what I do,nbut you know what?,My children, they knownthat their school fees are paid,,they have their books and their computer,,and this way, I knownthat they have a chance.,So I'm not going to tell younthat what I do, it's easy,,I'm not going to tell you that I feel --nwhat's that you said, liberated?,But I'm going to tell younthat I feel paid.,Right. (Applause) 
 Thanks, that's lovely,nand just the cup of tea, love,,and just a splash of the whiskey.,It's perfect, that's grand.nJust a drop more. A splash. Perfect.,What was your name? Peter?nIs that right, so, Peter?,Right. So that, that isnthe unique part of it for me,,right, is that I ended up in both,,first in the convent, and thennin the prostitution after. That's right.,(Laughter),So one woman at the universitynhere in Dublin, she wrote about me.,She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the livingnembodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.,Right? (Laughter),Doesn't it sound like somethingnyou need to go into hospital?,Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.,Doesn't it. 
 Right. Well, for me though, it was,nas a girl, it started with me dad.,I mean, half the time, when henspoke to us, it was just a sort of,tell us we were all useless rotten idiotsnand we had no morals, that type of thing.,And I certainly didn'tndo myself any favors.,By the time I was 16,,I had started messing aboutnwith this older fella,,and he wanted it to benour little secret,,and I did as I was told, didn't I,,and when that got back to me dad, henhad me sent straightaway to the convent.,Well no, that older fella, he would stillncome to find me in the convent.,Yeah, he'd leave me notes,tucked into the holes in the bricknat the back of the charity shop,so we could meet.,And he'd tell me hownhe's leaving his wife,,and I believed him, until I got pregnant.,I did, Peter, and I left him a notenabout it in our special place there,,and I never did hear from him again.,No, I gave it up for adoptionnso it could have a decent life,,and then they wouldn't let menback into the convent. 
 No, my one sister Virginia gave mena fiver for the coach to Dublin,,and that's how I ended up here.,Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in lovenwith another fella much older than me,,and I always say I was just so happynbecause he didn't drink,,I married the bastard. 
 Well, he didn't drink, but he did havenjust the wee heroin problem, didn't he,,and -- That's right, and before I knew it,,he was the one who turned me onnto the prostitution, my own husband.,He had me supporting the both of us.,I was 18.,Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman,nI can tell you that.,That Julia Roberts,,if she'd ever had to sleep with a mannto put a few pounds in her pocket,,I don't think she'd evernhave made that film.,Well, for your record,,my opinion of the legalization,nI'd say I'm against it.,I just, I don't care whatnthese young girls say.,You know, living like that,nyou're just lost,,and, you know, I'm 63 years old.,I'm still trying to find who I am.,You know, I never was a wife or a nun,,or a prostitute even, really, not really.,Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.,They just told me,,and if you legalize it,,then you're really telling these girls,n"Go on and get lost for a living,",and a lot of them,nthey'll do as they're told. 
 All right, so four perspectivesnfrom four quite -- (Applause) --,four quite different voices there, right?,One woman saying sex itself is naturalnbut the sex industry seems to,mechanize or industrialize it.,Then the second woman considerednsex work to be empowering,,liberating, and feminist,nthough she, herself, notably,,did not seem keen to do it.,The third woman, who actually wasna so-called sex worker,did not agree that it was liberatingnbut she wanted the right,to the economic empowerment,,and then we hear the fourth womannsaying not only prostitution itself,but proscribed roles for women in general,prevented her from evernfinding who she was, right? 
 So another fact most people did not know,was the average age of an at-risk girlnbeing introduced to the sex industry,was 12 or 13. 
 Also consider that the agenwhen all girls in that society,first became exposednto sexualized images of women,was quite a bit earlier, right?,This was a doll called Barbie, right?,I initially thought she was an educationalntool for anorexia prevention --,(Laughter) --,but actually she was considered by many,to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,,and often young girls begannwhat was called dieting.,Remember this? This wasnrestricting food intake on purpose,by the age of six,,and defining themselvesnbased on attractiveness,by around that same time. Right? 
 Yes?,Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.,So there was a lucrative marketnin that society in convincing all people,they had to look a certain waynto even have a sex life, right?,But girls, especially, were expectednto be "sexy" while avoiding,being perceived as "sluts"nfor being sexual. Right?,So there's that shame piecenwe've heard about. 
 Yes.,Valerie, right? Okay, very good.,Of course, men were having sex as well,,but you'll remember from the reading,,what were male sluts called?,Very good, they were called men.,(Laughter) (Applause),So not easy living inna world like that, right?,Though it was not all bad news either.,Most women in the early 2000snconsidered themselves empowered,,and men generally felt they werenalso evolved in this area,,and, in fact, most people would havenbeen aware of issues,like human trafficking, for example,,but they would have seen thatnas quite separate,from more recreationalnadult entertainment.,And so we'll just very briefly, class --nwe don't have a lot of time --,we'll just very briefly hear from a man,on our topic at this stage.,So this next subject was interviewednon the night of his bachelor party. 
 Dude, can you, all right,ncan you just keep it down?,I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.,Oh, your name's not BERT.,BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.,No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine.nI'm mostly sober,,so I just want to be helpful.,Yeah, and I totally believe in causes,nyeah, like, all that stuff.,(Laughter),And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.,Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,,like, you buy a pair and thenna kid in Africa gets clean water.,Yeah. Totally.,But what was the question again? Sorry. 
 Of course I believe in women's rights.nI'm marrying a woman.,(Laughter),No, but I mean, like, just becausenI'm in a strip club parking lot,doesn't mean that I'm, like,na sexist or whatever.,My fiancee is totally amazing,nshe's totally a strong girl, woman,,smart woman, like, the whole thing. 
 Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probablynat a strip club herself right now,,like, as a joke, same as me. 
 My best man, I told himnhe could surprise me,,and he thought this would be hilarious,,but this is not something.,Yeah, we all went to B school together.,Wharton.,(Laughter) 
 Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --,All right, but it's my bachelor party,,and I can spend it in the parking lotnwith Anderson Cooper if I want to.,All right, I'll see you in there. 
 All right, okay, so Anderson,,so, like, first of all, stripping,,but then, like, all the other thingsnyou're talking about,,prostitution and all that stuff,nthat's, like, not the same thing at all.,You know? Like, you keep calling itnthe sex industry or whatever,,but it's like, if the girl wantsnto be an exotic dancer,and she's 18, like, that's her right. 
 Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying,nbut I just feel like people,,they just want to make it seemnlike all dudes are just, like, predators,,that we would just automaticallyngo to a prostitute, or whatever.,Even, like, when I pledged, you know,nlike when I rushed my fraternity.,My brothers who I'm close to,nthose guys, they're all like me.,We're just normal people, but, like,nthere's this myth that you must,be that guy who is kind of an asshole,nand like, all bros before hos or whatever.,And actually, like, bros before hos,nit doesn't mean like what it sounds like.,It's actually just like a joking way ofnsaying that you care about your brothers,and you put them first. 
 Yeah, but, you can't blamenthe media, either.,I mean, like, if youngo watch "Hangover 2,",and you think that's an instruction manual,for your life, like,nI don't know what to tell you.,You know? You don'tnwatch "Bourne Identity",and go drive your carnover a gondola in Venice. (Laughter) 
 Well, yeah, okay, like, if you'rena little kid or whatever,,of course it's different, but -- 
 Yeah, all right, I remembernone thing like that.,I was at this kid's housenone time playing GTA,,uh, Grand Theft Auto? 
 Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter) 
 So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,,you're this kid, like, you're this guynwalking around or whatever,,and you can basically, like,nthe more cops you kill,,the more points you get,nand stuff like that.,But also, you can find prostitutes,and obviously you can donsexual stuff with them,,but you can, like, kill themnand take your money back.,Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran overna couple of them a few times with his car,and he got all these points.,We were, like, 10, I think.,It felt pretty terrible, actually.,No, I don't think I said anything,nI just finished playing and went home. 
 All right class, so then there were mennwho had more than just,a passing relationship to this issue.n(Laughter),The next subject described himselfnas a reformed and remorseful pimp,turned motivational speaker,,life coach and therapist,,but if you want to know more about him,nyou'll have to come to the entire play. 
 Thank you so much,nyou beautiful TED audience.,I will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date." 
 (Applause)(Guitar music) 
 I was just thinking,that I have been missing you way too long 
 There's something inside this weary head 
 that wants us to love just instead 
 But I was just thinking,,merely thinking 
 I've got loads of pictures, 
 I've got the one of younin that dancing dress 
 But man I feel silly in that dim light 
 Just after doing younby the sight of my Kodak delights, 
 I am sinking,,merely sinking 
 I think about long distance ratesninstead of kissing you babe 
 I'm a singer without a song 
 If I wait for you longer 
 my affection is stronger 
 and I ... I was just thinking,,merely thinking 
 that this boat is sinking 
 I'm tired of postcards,,especially the onesnwith cute dogs and cupids 
 I'm tired of calling you and missing you,and dreaming I slept with you 
 Don't get me wrongnI still desperately love you 
 inside this weary head 
 I just want us to love just instead 
 But I was just thinking and thinking,,merely thinking 
 I think about long distance ratesninstead of kissing you babe 
 and time is running me still 
 If I wait for you longer 
 my affection is stronger 
 I ... I was just thinking 
 I ... I was just thinking 
 that I'm tired of calling you once a week 
 thinking of long distance ratesninstead of kissing you 
 So baby I'm sinking, 
 merely sinking 
 (Guitar music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Singing is sharing.,When you sing, you have to knownwhat you're talking about intimately,,and you have to be willingnto share this insight,and give away a piece of yourself.,I look for this intentionnto share in everything,,and I ask: what are the intentionsnbehind this architecture or this product,or this restaurant or this meal?,And if your intentionsnare to impress people,or to get the big applause at the end,,then you are taking, not giving. 
 And this is a song that's about --,it's the kind of song that everyonenhas their version of.,This song is called "Home,",and it's sort of a "This is wherenI'm from, nice to meet you all,",kind of song. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Piano music) 
 Home is the sound of birdsnearly in the morning 
 Home is a song I've always remembered 
 Home is the memorynof my first day in school 
 Home is the books that I carry around 
 Home is an alley in a faraway town 
 Home is the places I’ve beennand where I’d like to go 
 Home 
 I'm always gonna feel at home 
 No matter where I may roam 
 I'm always gonna find my way back home 
 No matter how far I’m gone 
 I’m always gonna feel this longing 
 No matter where I might stay 
 Home is a feather twirling in the air 
 Home is flowers in a windowsill 
 Home is all the things she said to me 
 Home is a photo I never threw away 
 Home is the smile on my face when I die 
 Home is the taste of an apple pie 
 I met a woman, she always livednin the same place 
 And she said home is wherenyou’re born and raised 
 And I met a man, he satnlooking out to the sea 
 And he said home is where you want to be 
 I met a girl in some downtown bar 
 And she said I'll havenwhatever he's having 
 And I asked her how comenwe never met before? 
 And she said all my life I’ve been trying 
 to get a place of my own 
 I’m always gonna feel at home 
 No matter where I may roam 
 Always gonna find my way back home 
 No matter how far I’m gone 
 I'm always gonna feel this longing 
 No matter where I might stay 
 (Piano music) 
 (Piano music ends) 
 (Applause)Well, we all need a reason to wake up.,For me, it just took 11,000 volts. 
 I know you're too polite to ask,,so I will tell you. 
 One night, sophomore year of college,,just back from Thanksgiving holiday,,a few of my friends and Inwere horsing around,,and we decided to climb atopna parked commuter train.,It was just sitting there,nwith the wires that run overhead.,Somehow, that seemednlike a great idea at the time.,We'd certainly done stupider things.,I scurried up the ladder on the back,,and when I stood up,,the electrical current entered my arm,,blew down and out my feet,nand that was that.,Would you believe that watch still works?,Takes a licking! 
 (Laughter) 
 My father wears it now in solidarity. 
 That night began my formal relationshipnwith death -- my death --,and it also begannmy long run as a patient.,It's a good word.,It means one who suffers.,So I guess we're all patients. 
 Now, the American health care system,has more than its fair sharenof dysfunction --,to match its brilliance, to be sure.,I'm a physician now,na hospice and palliative medicine doc,,so I've seen care from both sides.,And believe me: almost everyonenwho goes into healthcare,really means well -- I mean, truly.,But we who work in itnare also unwitting agents,for a system that too oftenndoes not serve. 
 Why?,Well, there's actually a pretty easynanswer to that question,,and it explains a lot:,because healthcare was designednwith diseases, not people, at its center.,Which is to say, of course,nit was badly designed.,And nowhere are the effectsnof bad design more heartbreaking,or the opportunitynfor good design more compelling,than at the end of life,,where things are so distillednand concentrated.,There are no do-overs. 
 My purpose today isnto reach out across disciplines,and invite design thinkingninto this big conversation.,That is, to bring intention and creativity,to the experience of dying.,We have a monumentalnopportunity in front of us,,before one of the few universal issues,as individuals as well as a civil society:,to rethink and redesign how it is we die. 
 So let's begin at the end.,For most people, the scariest thingnabout death isn't being dead,,it's dying, suffering.,It's a key distinction.,To get underneath this,nit can be very helpful,to tease out sufferingnwhich is necessary as it is,,from suffering we can change.,The former is a natural,nessential part of life, part of the deal,,and to this we are callednto make space, adjust, grow.,It can be really goodnto realize forces larger than ourselves.,They bring proportionality,,like a cosmic right-sizing.,After my limbs were gone,,that loss, for example,nbecame fact, fixed --,necessarily part of my life,,and I learned that I could no morenreject this fact than reject myself.,It took me a while,nbut I learned it eventually.,Now, another great thingnabout necessary suffering,is that it is the very thing,that unites caregiver and care receiver --,human beings.,This, we are finally realizing,nis where healing happens.,Yes, compassion -- literally,nas we learned yesterday --,suffering together. 
 Now, on the systems side,non the other hand,,so much of the sufferingnis unnecessary, invented.,It serves no good purpose.,But the good news is,nsince this brand of suffering is made up,,well, we can change it.,How we die is indeednsomething we can affect.,Making the system sensitivento this fundamental distinction,between necessarynand unnecessary suffering,gives us our first of threendesign cues for the day.,After all, our role as caregivers,nas people who care,,is to relieve suffering --nnot add to the pile. 
 True to the tenets of palliative care,,I function as somethingnof a reflective advocate,,as much as prescribing physician.,Quick aside: palliative care -- a verynimportant field but poorly understood --,while it includes, it is notnlimited to end of life care.,It is not limited to hospice.,It's simply about comfortnand living well at any stage.,So please know that you don'tnhave to be dying anytime soon,to benefit from palliative care. 
 Now, let me introduce you to Frank.,Sort of makes this point.,I've been seeing Frank now for years.,He's living with advancing prostate cancernon top of long-standing HIV.,We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,,but most of the time we spend thinkingnout loud together about his life --,really, about our lives.,In this way, Frank grieves.,In this way, he keeps up withnhis losses as they roll in,,so that he's ready to take innthe next moment.,Loss is one thing,nbut regret, quite another.,Frank has always been an adventurer --,he looks like somethingnout of a Norman Rockwell painting --,and no fan of regret.,So it wasn't surprisingnwhen he came into clinic one day,,saying he wanted to raftndown the Colorado River.,Was this a good idea?,With all the risks to his safetynand his health, some would say no.,Many did, but he went for it,nwhile he still could.,It was a glorious, marvelous trip:,freezing water, blistering dry heat,nscorpions, snakes,,wildlife howling off the flaming wallsnof the Grand Canyon --,all the glorious side of the worldnbeyond our control.,Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,,is exactly the kindnso many of us would make,,if we only had the support to figure outnwhat is best for ourselves over time. 
 So much of what we're talking about todaynis a shift in perspective.,After my accident,nwhen I went back to college,,I changed my major to art history.,Studying visual art, I figurednI'd learn something about how to see --,a really potent lessonnfor a kid who couldn't change,so much of what he was seeing.,Perspective, that kind of alchemynwe humans get to play with,,turning anguish into a flower. 
 Flash forward: now I worknat an amazing place in San Francisco,called the Zen Hospice Project,,where we have a little ritualnthat helps with this shift in perspective.,When one of our residents dies,,the mortuary men come, and as we'renwheeling the body out through the garden,,heading for the gate, we pause.,Anyone who wants --,fellow residents, family,nnurses, volunteers,,the hearse drivers too, now --,shares a story or a song or silence,,as we sprinkle the bodynwith flower petals.,It takes a few minutes;,it's a sweet, simple parting imagento usher in grief with warmth,,rather than repugnance.,Contrast that with the typical experiencenin the hospital setting,,much like this -- floodlit roomnlined with tubes and beeping machines,and blinking lights that don't stopneven when the patient's life has.,Cleaning crew swoops in,nthe body's whisked away,,and it all feels as though that personnhad never really existed.,Well-intended, of course,nin the name of sterility,,but hospitals tend to assault our senses,,and the most we might hope fornwithin those walls is numbness --,anesthetic, literallynthe opposite of aesthetic.,I revere hospitals for what they can do;nI am alive because of them.,But we ask too much of our hospitals.,They are places for acute traumanand treatable illness.,They are no place to live and die;nthat's not what they were designed for. 
 Now mind you -- I am notngiving up on the notion,that our institutionsncan become more humane.,Beauty can be found anywhere.,I spent a few months in a burn unit,at St. Barnabas Hospitalnin Livingston, New Jersey,,where I got reallyngreat care at every turn,,including goodnpalliative care for my pain.,And one night, it began to snow outside.,I remember my nursesncomplaining about driving through it.,And there was no window in my room,,but it was great to just imagine itncoming down all sticky.,Next day, one of my nursesnsmuggled in a snowball for me.,She brought it in to the unit.,I cannot tell you the rapture I feltnholding that in my hand,,and the coldness drippingnonto my burning skin;,the miracle of it all,,the fascination as I watched it meltnand turn into water.,In that moment,,just being any part of this planetnin this universe mattered more to me,than whether I lived or died.,That little snowball packednall the inspiration I needed,to both try to livenand be OK if I did not.,In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. 
 In my work over the years,nI've known many people,who were ready to go, ready to die.,Not because they had foundnsome final peace or transcendence,,but because they were so repulsednby what their lives had become --,in a word, cut off, or ugly.,There are already record numbers of usnliving with chronic and terminal illness,,and into ever older age.,And we are nowhere near readynor prepared for this silver tsunami.,We need an infrastructurendynamic enough to handle,these seismic shifts in our population.,Now is the time to creatensomething new, something vital.,I know we can because we have to.,The alternative is just unacceptable.,And the key ingredients are known:,policy, education and training,,systems, bricks and mortar.,We have tons of inputnfor designers of all stripes to work with. 
 We know, for example, from research,what's most important to peoplenwho are closer to death:,comfort; feeling unburdenednand unburdening to those they love;,existential peace; and a sensenof wonderment and spirituality. 
 Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,,we've learned much morenfrom our residents in subtle detail.,Little things aren't so little.,Take Janette.,She finds it harder to breathenone day to the next due to ALS.,Well, guess what?,She wants to start smoking again --,and French cigarettes, if you please.,Not out of some self-destructive bent,,but to feel her lungs fillednwhile she has them.,Priorities change.,Or Kate -- she just wants to know,her dog Austin is lyingnat the foot of her bed,,his cold muzzle against her dry skin,,instead of more chemotherapyncoursing through her veins --,she's done that.,Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,nwhere in a moment, in an instant,,we are rewarded for just being.,So much of it comes down tonloving our time by way of the senses,,by way of the body -- the very thingndoing the living and the dying. 
 Probably the most poignant room,in the Zen Hospice guest housenis our kitchen,,which is a little strange when you realize,that so many of our residentsncan eat very little, if anything at all.,But we realize we are providingnsustenance on several levels:,smell, a symbolic plane.,Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuffnhappening under our roof,,one of the most tried and trueninterventions we know of,,is to bake cookies.,As long as we have our senses --,even just one --,we have at leastnthe possibility of accessing,what makes us feel human, connected.,Imagine the ripples of this notion,for the millions of peoplenliving and dying with dementia.,Primal sensorial delights that saynthe things we don't have words for,,impulses that make us stay present --,no need for a past or a future. 
 So, if teasing unnecessary suffering outnof the system was our first design cue,,then tending to dignitynby way of the senses,,by way of the body --nthe aesthetic realm --,is design cue number two.,Now this gets us quickly to the thirdnand final bit for today;,namely, we need to lift our sights,nto set our sights on well-being,,so that life and health and healthcare,can become about making lifenmore wonderful,,rather than just less horrible.,Beneficence. 
 Here, this gets right at the distinction,between a disease-centered and a patient-nor human-centered model of care,,and here is where caringnbecomes a creative, generative,,even playful act.,"Play" may sound like a funny word here.,But it is also one of ournhighest forms of adaptation.,Consider every major compulsory effortnit takes to be human.,The need for food has birthed cuisine.,The need for shelternhas given rise to architecture.,The need for cover, fashion.,And for being subjected to the clock,,well, we invented music.,So, since dyingnis a necessary part of life,,what might we create with this fact?,By "play" I am in no way suggestingnwe take a light approach to dying,or that we mandatenany particular way of dying.,There are mountains of sorrownthat cannot move,,and one way or another,nwe will all kneel there.,Rather, I am asking that we make space --,physical, psychic room, to allow lifento play itself all the way out --,so that rather than justngetting out of the way,,aging and dying can becomena process of crescendo through to the end.,We can't solve for death.,I know some of you are working on this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Meanwhile, we can -- 
 (Laughter) 
 We can design towards it.,Parts of me died early on,,and that's something we can all saynone way or another.,I got to redesign my lifenaround this fact,,and I tell you it has been a liberation,to realize you can always findna shock of beauty or meaning,in what life you have left,,like that snowball lastingnfor a perfect moment,,all the while melting away.,If we love such moments ferociously,,then maybe we can learn to live well --,not in spite of death,,but because of it.,Let death be what takes us,,not lack of imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When you're a child,,anything and everything is possible.,The challenge, so often,nis hanging on to that as we grow up.,And as a four-year-old,,I had the opportunitynto sail for the first time. 
 I will never forgetnthe excitement as we closed the coast.,I will never forget,the feeling of adventurenas I climbed on board the boat,and stared into her tiny cabinnfor the first time.,But the most amazing feelingnwas the feeling of freedom,,the feeling that I feltnwhen we hoisted her sails.,As a four-year-old child,,it was the greatest sense of freedomnthat I could ever imagine.,I made my mind up there and thennthat one day, somehow,,I was going to sail around the world. 
 So I did what I could in my lifento get closer to that dream.,Age 10, it was saving my schoolndinner money change.,Every single day for eight years,nI had mashed potato and baked beans,,which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.,Every day I would pile up the changenon the top of my money box,,and when that pile reached a pound,nI would drop it in,and cross off one of the 100 squaresnI'd drawn on a piece of paper.,Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.,I spent hours sitting on it in the gardenndreaming of my goal.,I read every book I could on sailing,,and then eventually,nhaving been told by my school,I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,,left school age 17 to beginnmy apprenticeship in sailing. 
 So imagine how it feltnjust four years later,to be sitting in a boardroom,in front of someone who I knewncould make that dream come true.,I felt like my lifendepended on that moment,,and incredibly, he said yes.,And I could barely contain my excitementnas I sat in that first design meeting,designing a boatnon which I was going to sail,solo nonstop around the world.,From that first meetingnto the finish line of the race,,it was everything I'd ever imagined.,Just like in my dreams, there werenamazing parts and tough parts.,We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.,Nine times, I climbed to the topnof her 90-foot mast.,We were blown on our sidenin the Southern Ocean.,But the sunsets, the wildlife,nand the remoteness,were absolutely breathtaking.,After three months at sea, age just 24,,I finished in second position.,I'd loved it, so much sonthat within six months,I decided to go around the world again,nbut this time not in a race:,to try to be the fastest person evernto sail solo nonstop around the world.,Now for this, I needed a different craft:,bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.,Just to give that boat some scale,nI could climb inside her mast,all the way to the top.,Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.,I affectionately called her Moby.,She was a multihull.,When we built her, no one had evernmade it solo nonstop,around the world in one,nthough many had tried,,but whilst we built her, a Frenchmanntook a boat 25 percent bigger than her,and not only did he make it,nbut he took the record from 93 days,right down to 72.,The bar was now much, much higher. 
 And these boats were exciting to sail.,This was a training sailnoff the French coast.,This I know well because I was onenof the five crew members on board.,Five seconds is all it tooknfrom everything being fine,to our world going blacknas the windows were thrust underwater,,and that five seconds goes quickly.,Just see how far belownthose guys the sea is.,Imagine that alonenin the Southern Ocean,plunged into icy water,nthousands of miles away from land. 
 It was Christmas Day.,I was forging into the Southern Oceannunderneath Australia.,The conditions were horrendous.,I was approaching a part in the ocean,which was 2,000 miles awaynfrom the nearest town.,The nearest land was Antarctica,nand the nearest people,would be those manningnthe European Space Station above me.,(Laughter),You really are in the middle of nowhere.,If you need help,,and you're still alive,,it takes four daysnfor a ship to get to you,and then four days for that shipnto get you back to port.,No helicopter can reach you out there,,and no plane can land.,We are forging ahead of a huge storm.,Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,,which was far too much windnfor the boat and I to cope with.,The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,,and the spray from the breaking crests,was blown horizontallynlike snow in a blizzard.,If we didn't sail fast enough,nwe'd be engulfed by that storm,,and either capsized or smashed to pieces.,We were quite literallynhanging on for our lives,and doing so on a knife edge. 
 The speed I so desperately needednbrought with it danger.,We all know what it's like driving a carn20 miles an hour, 30, 40.,It's not too stressful.nWe can concentrate.,We can turn on the radio.,Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate throughnto 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.,Now you have white knucklesnand you're gripping the steering wheel.,Now take that car off road at night,and remove the windscreen wipers,nthe windscreen,,the headlights and the brakes.,That's what it's likenin the Southern Ocean.,(Laughter) (Applause),You could imagine,it would be quite difficultnto sleep in that situation,,even as a passenger.,But you're not a passenger.,You're alone on a boatnyou can barely stand up in,,and you have to makenevery single decision on board.,I was absolutely exhausted,nphysically and mentally.,Eight sail changes in 12 hours.,The mainsail weighednthree times my body weight,,and after each change,,I would collapse on the floornsoaked with sweat,with this freezing Southern Ocean airnburning the back of my throat. 
 But out there, those lowest of the lows,are so often contrastednwith the highest of the highs.,A few days later, we came outnof the back of the low.,Against all odds, we'd been ablento drive ahead of the record,within that depression.,The sky cleared, the rain stopped,,and our heartbeat, the monstrousnseas around us were transformed,into the most beautiful moonlit mountains. 
 It's hard to explain, but you enterna different mode when you head out there.,Your boat is your entire world,,and what you take with younwhen you leave is all you have.,If I said to you all now,n"Go off into Vancouver,and find everything you will need fornyour survival for the next three months,",that's quite a task.,That's food, fuel, clothes,,even toilet roll and toothpaste.,That's what we do,,and when we leave we manage it,down to the last drop of dieselnand the last packet of food.,No experience in my life,could have given me a better understandingnof the definition of the word "finite.",What we have out there is all we have.,There is no more. 
 And never in my life had I everntranslated that definition of finite,that I'd felt on boardnto anything outside of sailing,until I stepped off the boat atnthe finish line having broken that record. 
 (Applause) 
 Suddenly I connected the dots.,Our global economy is no different.,It's entirely dependentnon finite materials,we only have oncenin the history of humanity.,And it was a bit like seeing somethingnyou weren't expecting under a stone,and having two choices:,I either put that stone to one side,and learn more about it,nor I put that stone back,and I carry on with my dream jobnof sailing around the world. 
 I chose the first.,I put it to one side and I beganna new journey of learning,,speaking to chief executives,nexperts, scientists, economists,to try to understand just hownour global economy works.,And my curiosity took mento some extraordinary places. 
 This photo was taken in the burnernof a coal-fired power station.,I was fascinated by coal,nfundamental to our global energy needs,,but also very close to my family.,My great-grandfather was a coal miner,,and he spent 50 yearsnof his life underground.,This is a photo of him,nand when you see that photo,,you see someone from another era.,No one wears trousersnwith a waistband quite that high,in this day and age. (Laughter),But yet, that's menwith my great-grandfather,,and by the way, they are notnhis real ears. (Laughter) 
 We were close. I remember sitting onnhis knee listening to his mining stories.,He talked of the camaraderie underground,,and the fact that the miners used to saventhe crusts of their sandwiches,to give to the poniesnthey worked with underground.,It was like it was yesterday.,And on my journey of learning,,I went to the WorldnCoal Association website,,and there in the middlenof the homepage, it said,,"We have about 118 years of coal left.",And I thought to myself, well,nthat's well outside my lifetime,,and a much greater figurenthan the predictions for oil.,But I did the math, and I realizednthat my great-grandfather,had been born exactly 118 yearsnbefore that year,,and I sat on his kneenuntil I was 11 years old,,and I realized it's nothing,in time, nor in history.,And it made me make a decisionnI never thought I would make:,to leave the sportnof solo sailing behind me,and focus on the greatest challengenI'd ever come across:,the future of our global economy. 
 And I quickly realized it wasn'tnjust about energy.,It was also materials.,In 2008, I picked up a scientific study,looking at how many years we have,of valuable materialsnto extract from the ground:,copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.,These figures couldn't be exact,nbut we knew those materials were finite.,We only have them once.,And yet, our speed that we've usednthese materials has increased rapidly,,exponentially.,With more people in the worldnwith more stuff,,we've effectively seenn100 years of price declines,in those basic commoditiesnerased in just 10 years.,And this affects all of us.,It's brought huge volatility in prices,,so much so that in 2011,,your average European car manufacturer,saw a raw material price increase,of 500 million Euros,,wiping away half their operating profits,through something they havenabsolutely no control over. 
 And the more I learned, the morenI started to change my own life.,I started traveling less,ndoing less, using less.,It felt like actually doing lessnwas what we had to do.,But it sat uneasy with me.,It didn't feel right.,It felt like we werenbuying ourselves time.,We were eking things out a bit longer.,Even if everybody changed,nit wouldn't solve the problem.,It wouldn't fix the system.,It was vital in the transition,nbut what fascinated me was,,in the transition to what?nWhat could actually work? 
 It struck me that the system itself,nthe framework within which we live,,is fundamentally flawed,,and I realized ultimately,that our operating system,nthe way our economy functions,,the way our economy's been built,nis a system in itself.,At sea, I had to understandncomplex systems.,I had to take multiple inputs,,I had to process them,,and I had to understand the system to win.,I had to make sense of it.,And as I looked at our global economy,nI realized it too is that system,,but it's a system that effectivelyncan't run in the long term. 
 And I realized we've been perfectingnwhat's effectively a linear economy,for 150 years,,where we take a materialnout of the ground,,we make something out of it,nand then ultimately,that product gets thrown away,nand yes, we do recycle some of it,,but more an attempt to get outnwhat we can at the end,,not by design.,It's an economy that fundamentallyncan't run in the long term,,and if we know that wenhave finite materials,,why would we build an economynthat would effectively use things up,,that would create waste?,Life itself has existednfor billions of years,and has continually adaptednto use materials effectively.,It's a complex system,nbut within it, there is no waste.,Everything is metabolized.,It's not a linear economynat all, but circular. 
 And I felt like the child in the garden.,For the first time on this new journey,nI could see exactly where we were headed.,If we could build an economy that wouldnuse things rather than use them up,,we could build a future that reallyncould work in the long term.,I was excited.,This was something to work towards.,We knew exactly where we were headed.nWe just had to work out how to get there,,and it was exactly with this in mind,that we created the Ellen MacArthurnFoundation in September 2010. 
 Many schools of thought fed our thinkingnand pointed to this model:,industrial symbiosis, performance economy,nsharing economy, biomimicry,,and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.,Materials would be definednas either technical or biological,,waste would be designed out entirely,,and we would have a systemnthat could function,absolutely in the long term. 
 So what could this economy look like?,Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings,nbut we'd pay for the service of light,,and the manufacturersnwould recover the materials,and change the light fittingsnwhen we had more efficient products.,What if packaging was so nontoxicnit could dissolve in water,and we could ultimately drink it?nIt would never become waste.,What if engines were re-manufacturable,,and we could recovernthe component materials,and significantly reduce energy demand.,What if we could recover componentsnfrom circuit boards, reutilize them,,and then fundamentally recovernthe materials within them,through a second stage?,What if we could collectnfood waste, human waste?,What if we could turn thatninto fertilizer, heat, energy,,ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems,and rebuilding natural capital?,And cars -- what we wantnis to move around.,We don't need to ownnthe materials within them.,Could cars become a service,and provide us withnmobility in the future?,All of this sounds amazing, but thesenaren't just ideas, they're real today,,and these lie at the forefrontnof the circular economy.,What lies before us is to expand themnand scale them up. 
 So how would you shiftnfrom linear to circular?,Well, the team and I at the foundationnthought you might want to work,with the top universities in the world,,with leading businesses within the world,,with the biggest conveningnplatforms in the world,,and with governments.,We thought you might wantnto work with the best analysts,and ask them the question,,"Can the circular economy decouplengrowth from resource constraints?,Is the circular economy ablento rebuild natural capital?,Could the circular economynreplace current chemical fertilizer use?",Yes was the answer to the decoupling,,but also yes, we could replacencurrent fertilizer use,by a staggering 2.7 times.,But what inspired me mostnabout the circular economy,was its ability to inspire young people.,When young people see the economynthrough a circular lens,,they see brand new opportunitiesnon exactly the same horizon.,They can use their creativitynand knowledge,to rebuild the entire system,,and it's there for the taking right now,,and the faster we do this, the better. 
 So could we achieve thisnin their lifetimes?,Is it actually possible?,I believe yes.,When you look at the lifetime ofnmy great-grandfather, anything's possible.,When he was born, there were onlyn25 cars in the world;,they had only just been invented.,When he was 14, we flewnfor the first time in history.,Now there are 100,000 charter flights,every single day.,When he was 45, we builtnthe first computer.,Many said it wouldn't catch on,nbut it did, and just 20 years later,we turned it into a microchip,of which there will be thousandsnin this room here today.,Ten years before he died,nwe built the first mobile phone.,It wasn't that mobile, to be fair,,but now it really is,,and as my great-grandfathernleft this Earth, the Internet arrived.,Now we can do anything,,but more importantly,,now we have a plan. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi. I'm going to talk nto you today about laughter,,and I just want to start nby thinking about the first time,I can ever remember noticing laughter.,This is when I was a little girl.nI would've been about six.,And I came across my parentsndoing something unusual,,where they were laughing.,They were laughing very, very hard.,They were lying on the floor laughing.,They were screaming with laughter.,I did not know what they were nlaughing at, but I wanted in.,I wanted to be part of that,,and I kind of sat around at the edgengoing, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter),Now, incidentally,nwhat they were laughing at,was a song which people used to sing,,which was based aroundnsigns in toilets on trains,telling you what you couldnand could not do,in toilets on trains.,And the thing you have to remembernabout the English is, of course,,we do have an immenselynsophisticated sense of humor.,(Laughter) 
 At the time, though, I didn'tnunderstand anything of that.,I just cared about the laughter,,and actually, as a neuroscientist,nI've come to care about it again.,And it is a really weird thing to do.,What I'm going to do nownis just play some examples,of real human beings laughing,,and I want you think about the soundnpeople make and how odd that can be,,and in fact how primitivenlaughter is as a sound.,It's much more like an animal callnthan it is like speech.,So here we've got some laughter for you.nThe first one is pretty joyful. 
 (Audio: Laughing) 
 Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.,There's a point in therenwhere I'm just, like,,you've got to get some air in there, mate,,because he just soundsnlike he's breathing out. 
 (Audio: Laughing) 
 This hasn't been edited; this is him. 
 (Audio: Laughing)n(Laughter) 
 And finally we have -- nthis is a human female laughing.,And laughter can take us to some prettynodd places in terms of making noises.,(Audio: Laughing),She actually says, "Oh my God,nwhat is that?" in French.,We're all kind of with her.nI have no idea. 
 Now, to understand laughter,nyou have to look at a part of the body,that psychologists and neuroscientistsndon't normally spend much time looking at,,which is the ribcage,,and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,,but actually you're all using nyour ribcage all the time.,What you're all doing nat the moment with your ribcage,,and don't stop doing it, is breathing.,So you use the intercostal muscles,nthe muscles between your ribs,,to bring air in and out of your lungs,just by expandingnand contracting your ribcage,,and if I was to put a strap naround the outside of your chest,called a breath belt, and just look nat that movement,,you see a rather gentle sinusoidalnmovement, so that's breathing.,You're all doing it. Don't stop.,As soon as you start talking,,you start using your breathingncompletely differently.,So what I'm doing now is you seensomething much more like this.,In talking, you use very finenmovements of the ribcage,to squeeze the air out --,and in fact, we're the only animalsnthat can do this.,It's why we can talk at all. 
 Now, both talking and breathingnhas a mortal enemy,,and that enemy is laughter,,because what happens when you laugh,is those same musclesnstart to contract very regularly,,and you get this very markednsort of zig-zagging,,and that's just squeezingnthe air out of you.,It literally is that basic a waynof making a sound.,You could be stamping on somebody,nit's having the same effect.,You're just squeezing air out,,and each of those contractions --nHa! -- gives you a sound.,And as the contractions run together,nyou can get these spasms,,and that's when you start gettingnthese -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.,I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter) 
 Now, in terms of the science of laughter,nthere isn't very much,,but it does turn out that pretty muchneverything we think we know,about laughter is wrong.,So it's not at all unusual, for example,nto hear people to say,humans are the only animals that laugh.,Nietzsche thought that humansnare the only animals that laugh.,In fact, you find laughternthroughout the mammals.,It's been well-describednand well-observed in primates,,but you also see it in rats,,and wherever you find it --,humans, primates, rats --,you find it associatednwith things like tickling.,That's the same for humans.,You find it associated with play,nand all mammals play.,And wherever you find it,nit's associated with interactions.,So Robert Provine, who has donena lot of work on this,,has pointed out that you are 30 times nmore likely to laugh,if you are with somebody elsenthan if you're on your own,,and where you find most laughter,is in social interactionsnlike conversation.,So if you ask human beings,n"When do you laugh?",they'll talk about comedy and they'll talknabout humor and they'll talk about jokes.,If you look at when they laugh,nthey're laughing with their friends.,And when we laugh with people, we'renhardly ever actually laughing at jokes.,You are laughing to show peoplenthat you understand them,,that you agree with them, that you'renpart of the same group as them.,You're laughing to shownthat you like them.,You might even love them.,You're doing all that at the same timenas talking to them,,and the laughter is doing a lotnof that emotional work for you.,Something that Robert Provinenhas pointed out, as you can see here,,and the reason why we were laughing,when we heard thosenfunny laughs at the start,,and why I was laughingnwhen I found my parents laughing,,is that it's an enormouslynbehaviorally contagious effect.,You can catch laughter from somebody else,,and you are more likely to catch laughternoff somebody else if you know them.,So it's still modulatednby this social context.,You have to put humor to one side,and think about the social nmeaning of laughter,because that's where its origins lie. 
 Now, something I've got very interested innis different kinds of laughter,,and we have some neurobiological evidencenabout how human beings vocalize,that suggests there might bentwo kinds of laughs that we have.,So it seems possible that the neurobiologynfor helpless, involuntary laughter,,like my parents lying on the floornscreaming about a silly song,,might have a different basis to itnthan some of that more polite,social laughter that you encounter,nwhich isn't horrible laughter,,but it's behavior somebody is doingnas part of their communicative act to you,,part of their interaction with you;nthey are choosing to do this.,In our evolution, we have developedntwo different ways of vocalizing.,Involuntary vocalizationsnare part of an older system,than the more voluntary vocalizationsnlike the speech I'm doing now.,So we might imagine that laughternmight actually have two different roots. 
 So I've been looking at thisnin more detail.,To do this, we've had to makenrecordings of people laughing,,and we've had to do whatever it takesnto make people laugh,,and we got those same peoplento produce more posed, social laughter.,So imagine your friend told a joke,,and you're laughing becausenyou like your friend,,but not really becausenthe joke's all that.,So I'm going to play you na couple of those.,I want you to tell me if you thinknthis laughter is real laughter,,or if you think it's posed.,So is this involuntary laughternor more voluntary laughter? 
 (Audio: Laughing) 
 What does that sound like to you?,Audience: Posed.nSophie Scott: Posed? Posed.,How about this one? 
 (Audio: Laughing) 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm the best. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Not really.,No, that was helpless laughter,,and in fact, to record that,nall they had to do was record me,watching one of my friends listening tonsomething I knew she wanted to laugh at,,and I just started doing this. 
 What you find is that peoplenare good at telling the difference,between real and posed laughter.,They seem to be different things to us.,Interestingly, you see somethingnquite similar with chimpanzees.,Chimpanzees laugh differentlynif they're being tickled,than if they're playing with each other,,and we might be seeingnsomething like that here,,involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,nbeing different from social laughter.,They're acoustically very different.,The real laughs are longer.nThey're higher in pitch.,When you start laughing hard,,you start squeezing air outnfrom your lungs,under much higher pressuresnthan you could ever produce voluntarily.,For example, I could nevernpitch my voice that high to sing.,Also, you start to get these sort ofncontractions and weird whistling sounds,,all of which mean that real laughternis extremely easy,,or feels extremely easy to spot. 
 In contrast, posed laughter,nwe might think it sounds a bit fake.,Actually, it's not, it's actuallynan important social cue.,We use it a lot, we're choosingnto laugh in a lot of situations,,and it seems to be its own thing.,So, for example, you findnnasality in posed laughter,,that kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound,that you never get, you could not do,nif you were laughing involuntarily.,So they do seem to be genuinelynthese two different sorts of things. 
 We took it into the scannernto see how brains respond,when you hear laughter.,And when you do this,nthis is a really boring experiment.,We just played peoplenreal and posed laughs.,We didn't tell themnit was a study on laughter.,We put other sounds in there nto distract them,,and all they're doingnis lying listening to sounds.,We don't tell them to do anything.,Nonetheless, when you hear real laughternand when you hear posed laughter,,the brains are respondingncompletely differently,,significantly differently.,What you see in the regions in blue,nwhich lies in auditory cortex,,are the brain areas that respondnmore to the real laughs,,and what seems to be the case,,when you hear somebodynlaughing involuntarily,,you hear sounds you would nevernhear in any other context.,It's very unambiguous,,and it seems to be associatednwith greater auditory processing,of these novel sounds.,In contrast, when you hear somebodynlaughing in a posed way,,what you see are these regions in pink,,which are occupying brain areasnassociated with mentalizing,,thinking about whatnsomebody else is thinking.,And I think what that means is,,even if you're having your brain scanned,nwhich is completely boring,and not very interesting,,when you hear somebody going,n"A ha ha ha ha ha,",you're trying to work outnwhy they're laughing.,Laughter is always meaningful.,You are always tryingnto understand it in context,,even if, as far as you are concerned,nat that point in time,,it has not necessarilynanything to do with you,,you still want to knownwhy those people are laughing. 
 Now, we've had the opportunity to look nat how people hear real and posed laughter,across the age range.,So this is an online experimentnwe ran with the Royal Society,,and here we just asked peoplentwo questions.,First of all, they heard some laughs,,and they had to say, how real nor posed do these laughs sound?,The real laughs are shown in rednand the posed laughs are shown in blue.,What you see is there is a rapid onset.,As you get older, you get betternand better at spotting real laughter.,So six-year-olds are at chance,nthey can't really hear the difference.,By the time you are older, you get better,,but interestingly, you do not hitnpeak performance in this dataset,until you are in yournlate 30s and early 40s.,You don't understand laughter fullynby the time you hit puberty.,You don't understand laughter fullynby the time your brain has matured,at the end of your teens.,You're learning about laughternthroughout your entire early adult life. 
 If we turn the question around and now saynnot, what does the laughter sound like,in terms of being realnor posed, but we say,,how much does this laughternmake you want to laugh,,how contagious is this laughter to you,nwe see a different profile.,And here, the younger you are,,the more you want to join innwhen you hear laughter.,Remember me laughing with my parentsnwhen I had no idea what was going on.,You really can see this.,Now everybody, young and old,,finds the real laughs more contagiousnthan the posed laughs,,but as you get older, it all becomes nless contagious to you.,Now, either we're all just becomingnreally grumpy as we get older,,or it may mean that as younunderstand laughter better,,and you are getting better at doing that,,you need more than justnhearing people laugh to want to laugh.,You need the social stuff there. 
 So we've got a very interesting behavior,about which a lot of ournlay assumptions are incorrect,,but I'm coming to see that actuallynthere's even more to laughter,than it's an important social emotionnwe should look at,,because it turns outnpeople are phenomenally nuanced,in terms of how we use laughter.,There's a really lovelynset of studies coming out,from Robert Levenson's lab in California,,where he's doingna longitudinal study with couples.,He gets married couples,nmen and women, into the lab,,and he gives themnstressful conversations to have,while he wires them up to a polygraphnso he can see them becoming stressed.,So you've got the two of them in there,nand he'll say to the husband,,"Tell me something that your wife doesnthat irritates you.",And what you see is immediately --,just run that one through your headnbriefly, you and your partner --,you can imagine everybody gets a bitnmore stressed as soon as that starts.,You can see physically,npeople become more stressed.,What he finds is that the couplesnwho manage that feeling of stress,with laughter,npositive emotions like laughter,,not only immediately become less stressed,,they can see themnphysically feeling better,,they're dealing with thisnunpleasant situation better together,,they are also the couples that report,high levels of satisfactionnin their relationship,and they stay together for longer.,So in fact, when you looknat close relationships,,laughter is a phenomenally useful index,of how people are regulatingntheir emotions together.,We're not just emitting it at each othernto show that we like each other,,we're making ourselvesnfeel better together. 
 Now, I don't think this is goingnto be limited to romantic relationships.,I think this is probablyngoing to be a characteristic,of close emotional relationshipsnsuch as you might have with friends,,which explains my next clip,,which is of a YouTube video of somenyoung men in the former East Germany,on making a video to promotentheir heavy metal band,,and it's extremely macho,nand the mood is very serious,,and I want you to noticenwhat happens in terms of laughter,when things go wrong,and how quickly that happens,nand how that changes the mood. 
 He's cold. He's about to get wet.nHe's got swimming trunks on,,got a towel.,Ice.,What might possibly happen?,Video starts.,Serious mood.,And his friends are already laughing.nThey are already laughing, hard.,He's not laughing yet.,(Laughter),He's starting to go now.,And now they're all off.,(Laughter),They're on the floor.,(Laughter) 
 The thing I really like about thatnis it's all very serious,until he jumps onto the ice, andnas soon as he doesn't go through the ice,,but also there isn't bloodnand bone everywhere,,his friends start laughing.,And imagine if that had played him outnwith him standing there going,,"No seriously, Heinrich,nI think this is broken,",we wouldn't enjoy watching that.nThat would be stressful.,Or if he was running aroundnwith a visibly broken leg laughing,,and his friends are going, "Heinrich, Inthink we need to go to the hospital now,",that also wouldn't be funny.,The fact that the laughter works,,it gets him from a painful,nembarrassing, difficult situation,,into a funny situation, into what we're nactually enjoying there,,and I think that's na really interesting use,,and it's actually happening all the time. 
 For example, I can remembernsomething like this happening,at my father's funeral.,We weren't jumping aroundnon the ice in our underpants.,We're not Canadian.,(Laughter) (Applause),These events are always difficult, I hadna relative who was being a bit difficult,,my mum was not in a good place,,and I can remember finding myselfnjust before the whole thing started,telling this story about somethingnthat happened in a 1970s sitcom,,and I just thought at the time,nI don't know why I'm doing this,,and what I realized I was doing,was I was coming up withnsomething from somewhere,I could use to make her laughntogether with me.,It was a very basic reactionnto find some reason we can do this.,We can laugh together.nWe're going to get through this.,We're going to be okay. 
 And in fact, all of usnare doing this all the time.,You do it so often,nyou don't even notice it.,Everybody underestimatesnhow often they laugh,,and you're doing something,nwhen you laugh with people,,that's actually letting you accessna really ancient evolutionary system,that mammals have evolvednto make and maintain social bonds,,and clearly to regulate emotions,nto make ourselves feel better.,It's not something specific to humans --nit's a really ancient behavior,which really helps us regulate how we feelnand makes us feel better. 
 In other words, when it comes to laughter,,you and me, baby, ain't nothing nbut mammals. (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. (Applause)So I've had the great privilege,of traveling to some incredible places,,photographing these distant landscapesnand remote cultures,all over the world.,I love my job. 
 But people think it'snthis string of epiphanies,and sunrises and rainbows,,when in reality, it looksnmore something like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is my office. 
 We can't afford the fanciest placesnto stay at night,,so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.,As long as we can stay dry,,that's a bonus.,We also can't affordnthe fanciest restaurants.,So we tend to eatnwhatever's on the local menu.,And if you're in the Ecuadorian Páramo,,you're going to eatna large rodent called a cuy. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what makes our experiencesnperhaps a little bit different,and a little more uniquenthan that of the average person,is that we have this gnawing thingnin the back of our mind,that even in our darkest moments,nand those times of despair,,we think, "Hey, there might benan image to be made here,,there might be a story to be told." 
 And why is storytelling important?,Well, it helps us to connect with ourncultural and our natural heritage.,And in the Southeast,,there's an alarming disconnectnbetween the public,and the natural areas that allownus to be here in the first place.,We're visual creatures,,so we use what we seento teach us what we know. 
 Now the majority of usnaren't going to willingly go,way down to a swamp.,So how can we still expectnthose same people to then advocate,on behalf of their protection?,We can't. 
 So my job, then, is to use photographynas a communication tool,,to help bridge the gapnbetween the science and the aesthetics,,to get people talking,,to get them thinking,,and to hopefully, ultimately,,get them caring. 
 I started doing this 15 years agonright here in Gainesville,,right here in my backyard.,And I fell in lovenwith adventure and discovery,,going to explorenall these different places,that were just minutesnfrom my front doorstep.,There are a lotnof beautiful places to find.,Despite all these years that have passed,,I still see the worldnthrough the eyes of a child,and I try to incorporatenthat sense of wonderment,and that sense of curiosityninto my photography,as often as I can. 
 And we're pretty luckynbecause here in the South,,we're still blessednwith a relatively blank canvas,that we can fill with the mostnfanciful adventures,and incredible experiences.,It's just a matter of how farnour imagination will take us.,See, a lot of peoplenlook at this and they say,,"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree.",But I don't just see a tree --,I look at this and I see opportunity.,I see an entire weekend.,Because when I was a kid,nthese were the types of images,that got me off the sofanand dared me to explore,,dared me to go find the woods,and put my head underwaternand see what we have. 
 And folks, I've been photographingnall over the world,and I promise you,,what we have here in the South,,what we have in the Sunshine State,,rivals anything else that I've seen.,But yet our tourism industry is busynpromoting all the wrong things.,Before most kids are 12,nthey'll have been to Disney World,more times than they've been in a canoe,or camping under a starry sky.,And I have nothing against Disneynor Mickey; I used to go there, too.,But they're missing out on thosenfundamental connections,that create a real sensenof pride and ownership,for the place that they call home. 
 And this is compounded by the issuenthat the landscapes,that define our natural heritage,and fuel our aquifernfor our drinking water,have been deemed as scarynand dangerous and spooky.,When our ancestors first came here,,they warned, "Stay outnof these areas, they're haunted.,They're full of evil spirits and ghosts.",I don't know wherenthey came up with that idea.,But it's actually lednto a very real disconnect,,a very real negative mentality,that has kept the publicndisinterested, silent,,and ultimately, our environment at risk.,We're a state that's surroundednand defined by water,,and yet for centuries,,swamps and wetlands have been regarded,as these obstacles to overcome.,And so we've treated themnas these second-class ecosystems,,because they havenvery little monetary value,and of course, they're knownnto harbor alligators and snakes --,which, I'll admit, these aren'tnthe most cuddly of ambassadors. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it became assumed, then,nthat the only good swamp,was a drained swamp.,And in fact,,draining a swamp to make waynfor agriculture and development,was considered the very essencenof conservation not too long ago. 
 But now we're backpedaling,,because the more we come to learnnabout these sodden landscapes,,the more secrets we're starting to unlock,about interspecies relationships,and the connectivity of habitats,nwatersheds and flyways.,Take this bird, for example:,this is the prothonotary warbler.,I love this bird becausenit's a swamp bird,,through and through, a swamp bird.,They nest and they mate and they breednin these old-growth swamps,in these flooded forests.,And so after the spring,nafter they raise their young,,they then fly thousand of milesnover the Gulf of Mexico,into Central and South America.,And then after the winter,,the spring rolls aroundnand they come back.,They fly thousands of milesnover the Gulf of Mexico.,And where do they go? Where do they land?,Right back in the same tree.,That's nuts.,This is a bird the sizenof a tennis ball --,I mean, that's crazy!,I used a GPS to get here today,,and this is my hometown. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's crazy.,So what happens, then, when this birdnflies over the Gulf of Mexico,into Central America for the winter,and then the spring rolls aroundnand it flies back,,and it comes back to this:,a freshly sodded golf course? 
 This is a narrative that'snall too commonly unraveling,here in this state.,And this is a natural processnthat's occurred for thousands of years,and we're just now learning about it.,So you can imagine all else we havento learn about these landscapes,if we just preserve them first.,Now despite all this rich lifenthat abounds in these swamps,,they still have a bad name. 
 Many people feel uncomfortablenwith the idea of wading,into Florida's blackwater.,I can understand that.,But what I loved about growing upnin the Sunshine State,is that for so many of us,,we live with this latentnbut very palpable fear,that when we put our toes into the water,,there might be something much more ancient,and much more adapted than we are.,Knowing that you're not top dognis a welcomed discomfort, I think.,How often in this modernnand urban and digital age,do you actually get the chancento feel vulnerable,,or consider that the world may notnhave been made for just us? 
 So for the last decade,,I began seeking out these areasnwhere the concrete yields to forest,and the pines turn to cypress,,and I viewed all thesenmosquitoes and reptiles,,all these discomforts,,as affirmations that I'd foundntrue wilderness,,and I embrace them wholly.,Now as a conservation photographernobsessed with blackwater,,it's only fitting that I'dneventually end up,in the most famous swamp of all:,the Everglades. 
 Growing up here in North Central Florida,,it always had these enchanted names,,places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,,Corkscrew, Big Cypress.,I started what turnedninto a five-year project,to hopefully reintroducenthe Everglades in a new light,,in a more inspired light.,But I knew this would be a tall order,nbecause here you have an area,that's roughly a third the sizenthe state of Florida, it's huge.,And when I say Everglades,,most people are like,n"Oh, yeah, the national park.",But the Everglades is not just a park;nit's an entire watershed,,starting with the Kissimmeenchain of lakes in the north,,and then as the rainsnwould fall in the summer,,these downpours would flowninto Lake Okeechobee,,and Lake Okeechobee would fill upnand it would overflow its banks,and spill southward, ever slowly,nwith the topography,,and get into the river of grass,nthe Sawgrass Prairies,,before meting into the cypress slews,,until going further southninto the mangrove swamps,,and then finally -- finally --nreaching Florida Bay,,the emerald gem of the Everglades,,the great estuary,,the 850 square-mile estuary. 
 So sure, the national parknis the southern end of this system,,but all the things that make it uniquenare these inputs that come in,,the fresh water that startsn100 miles north.,So no manner of these politicalnor invisible boundaries,protect the park from polluted waternor insufficient water.,And unfortunately, that's preciselynwhat we've done.,Over the last 60 years,,we have drained, we have dammed,nwe have dredged the Everglades,to where now only one third of the waternthat used to reach the bay,now reaches the bay today.,So this story is not all sunshinenand rainbows, unfortunately.,For better or for worse,,the story of the Evergladesnis intrinsically tied,to the peaks and the valleysnof mankind's relationship,with the natural world. 
 But I'll show younthese beautiful pictures,,because it gets you on board.,And while I have your attention,nI can tell you the real story.,It's that we're taking this,,and we're trading it for this,,at an alarming rate.,And what's lost on so many people,is the sheer scalenof which we're discussing.,Because the Everglades is not justnresponsible for the drinking water,for 7 million Floridians;,today it also providesnthe agricultural fields,for the year-round tomatoes and oranges,for over 300 million Americans.,And it's that same seasonal pulsenof water in the summer,that built the river of grassn6,000 years ago.,Ironically, today, it's also responsiblenfor the over half a million acres,of the endless river of sugarcane.,These are the same fieldsnthat are responsible,for dumping exceedingly high levelsnof fertilizers into the watershed,,forever changing the system. 
 But in order for you to not justnunderstand how this system works,,but to also get personallynconnected to it,,I decided to break the story downninto several different narratives.,And I wanted that story to startnin Lake Okeechobee,,the beating heart of the Everglade system.,And to do that, I picked an ambassador,,an iconic species.,This is the Everglade snail kite.,It's a great bird,,and they used to nest in the thousands,,thousands in the northern Everglades.,And then they've gone downnto about 400 nesting pairs today.,And why is that?,Well, it's because they eatnone source of food, an apple snail,,about the size of a ping-pong ball,nan aquatic gastropod. 
 So as we started damming upnthe Everglades,,as we started diking Lake Okeechobeenand draining the wetlands,,we lost the habitat for the snail.,And thus, the populationnof the kites declined.,And so, I wanted a photo that wouldnnot only communicate this relationship,between wetland, snail and bird,,but I also wanted a photonthat would communicate,how incredible this relationship was,,and how very important it isnthat they've come to depend on each other,,this healthy wetland and this bird.,And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.,I started sketchingnout these plans to make a photo,,and I sent it to the wildlife biologistndown in Okeechobee --,this is an endangered bird,nso it takes special permission to do.,So I built this submerged platform,that would hold snailsnjust right under the water.,And I spent months planningnthis crazy idea.,And I took this platformndown to Lake Okeechobee,and I spent over a week in the water,,wading waist-deep,n9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,,to get one image that I thoughtnmight communicate this.,And here's the day that it finally worked: 
 [Video: (Mac Stone narrating)nAfter setting up the platform,,I look off and I see a kitencoming over the cattails.,And I see him scanning and searching.,And he gets right over the trap,,and I see that he's seen it.,And he beelines,nhe goes straight for the trap.,And in that moment,nall those months of planning, waiting,,all the sunburn, mosquito bites --,suddenly, they're all worth it.,(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,nI can't believe it!] 
 You can believe how excited I wasnwhen that happened.,But what the idea was,,is that for someonenwho's never seen this bird,and has no reason to care about it,,these photos, these new perspectives,,will help shed a little new lightnon just one species,that makes this watershednso incredible, so valuable, so important.,Now, I know I can't comenhere to Gainesville,and talk to you about animalsnin the Everglades,without talking about gators.,I love gators, I grew up loving gators.,My parents always said I hadnan unhealthy relationship with gators.,But what I like about them is,,they're like the freshwaternequivalent of sharks.,They're feared, they're hated,,and they are tragically misunderstood.,Because these are a unique species,nthey're not just apex predators.,In the Everglades,,they are the very architectsnof the Everglades,,because as the water dropsndown in the winter,during the dry season,,they start excavating these holesncalled gator holes.,And they do this becausenas the water drops down,,they'll be able to stay wetnand they'll be able to forage.,And now this isn't just affecting them,,other animals also dependnon this relationship,,so they become a keystone species as well.,So how do you make an apex predator,nan ancient reptile,,at once look like it dominates the system,,but at the same time, look vulnerable?,Well, you wade into a pitnof about 120 of them,,then you hope that you've madenthe right decision. 
 (Laughter) 
 I still have all my fingers, it's cool. 
 But I understand, I knownI'm not going to rally you guys,,I'm not going to rally the troops ton"Save the Everglades for the gators!",It won't happen becausenthey're so ubiquitous,,we see them now,,they're one of the great conservationnsuccess stories of the US.,But there is one species in the Evergladesnthat no matter who you are,,you can't help but love, too,nand that's the roseate spoonbill.,These birds are great, but they've hadna really tough time in the Everglades,,because they started out with thousandsnof nesting pairs in Florida Bay,,and at the turn of the 20th century,,they got down to two -- two nesting pairs.,And why?,That's because women thoughtnthey looked better on their hats,then they did flying in the sky.,Then we banned the plume trade,,and their numbers started rebounding.,And as their numbers started rebounding,,scientists began to pay attention,,they started studying these birds. 
 And what they found out is that,these birds' behaviornis intrinsically tied,to the annual draw-downncycle of water in the Everglades,,the thing that definesnthe Everglades watershed.,What they found out is that,these birds started nesting in the winternas the water drew down,,because they're tactile feeders,nso they have to touch whatever they eat.,And so they wait for thesenconcentrated pools of fish,to be able to feed enoughnto feed their young.,So these birds became the very iconnof the Everglades --,an indicator speciesnof the overall health of the system.,And just as their numbers were reboundingnin the mid-20th century --,shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --,just as that started happening, we startedndraining the southern Everglades.,And we stopped two-thirdsnof that water from moving south.,And it had drastic consequences.,And just as those numbersnstarted reaching their peak,,unfortunately, today,nthe real spoonbill story,,the real photo of what it looks likenis more something like this.,And we're down to less than 70nnesting pairs in Florida Bay today,,because we've disruptednthe system so much.,So all these different organizationsnare shouting, they're screaming,,"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!",It is not.,It is resilient.,Because despite all we've taken,ndespite all we've done and we've drained,and we've dammed and we've dredged it,,pieces of it are still here,nwaiting to be put back together. 
 And this is what I've lovednabout South Florida,,that in one place, you haventhis unstoppable force of mankind,meeting the immovable objectnof tropical nature.,And it's at this new frontiernthat we are forced with a new appraisal.,What is wilderness worth?,What is the value of biodiversity,nor our drinking water?,And fortunately, after decades of debate,,we're finally starting to actnon those questions.,We're slowly undertaking these projects,to bring more freshwater back to the bay.,But it's up to us as citizens,nas residents, as stewards,to hold our elected officialsnto their promises. 
 What can you do to help?,It's so easy.,Just get outside, get out there.,Take your friends out, take your kids out,,take your family out.,Hire a fishing guide.,Show the state that protecting wilderness,not only makes ecological sense,nbut economic sense as well.,It's a lot of fun, just do it --nput your feet in the water.,The swamp will change you, I promise. 
 Over the years, we've been so generous,with these other landscapesnaround the country,,cloaking them with this American pride,,places that we now consider to define us:,Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.,And we use these parksnand these natural areas,as beacons and as cultural compasses.,And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly,left out of that conversation.,But I believe it's every bitnas iconic and emblematic,of who we are as a country,as any of these other wildernesses.,It's just a different kind of wild. 
 But I'm encouraged,,because maybe we're finallynstarting to come around,,because what was once deemednthis swampy wasteland,,today is a World Heritage site.,It's a wetlandnof international importance.,And we've come a long waynin the last 60 years.,And as the world's largest and mostnambitious wetland restoration project,,the international spotlightnis on us in the Sunshine State.,Because if we can heal this system,,it's going to become an iconnfor wetland restoration,all over the world.,But it's up to us to decide which legacynwe want to attach our flag to. 
 They say that the Evergladesnis our greatest test.,If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.,I love that quote,,because it's a challenge, it's a prod.,Can we do it? Will we do it?,We have to, we must.,But the Everglades is not just a test.,It's also a gift,,and ultimately, our responsibility. 
 Thank you.

 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A few years ago,,my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.,Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up,ncausing crippling, chronic pain.,She had to file for disability.,She stopped attending our local mosque.,Some mornings it was too painfulnfor her to brush her teeth.,I wanted to help.,But I didn't know how.,I'm not a doctor. 
 So, what I am is a historian of medicine.,So I started to researchnthe history of chronic pain.,Turns out, UCLA has an entirenhistory of pain collection,in their archives.,And I found a story --na fantastic story --,of a man who saved -- rescued --nmillions of people from pain;,people like my mom.,Yet, I had never heard of him.,There were no biographiesnof him, no Hollywood movies.,His name was John J. Bonica.,But when our story begins,,he was better known asnJohnny "Bull" Walker. 
 It was a summer day in 1941.,The circus had just arrivednin the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.,Spectators flocked to seenthe wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --,if they were lucky, the human cannonball.,They also came to see the strongman,nJohnny "Bull" Walker,,a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.,You know, on that particular day,na voice rang out,over the circus P.A. system.,They needed a doctor urgently,nin the live animal tent.,Something had gone wrongnwith the lion tamer.,The climax of his act had gone wrong,,and his head was stuckninside the lion's mouth.,He was running out of air;,the crowd watched in horror,as he struggled and then passed out.,When the lion finally did relax its jaws,,the lion tamer just slumpednto the ground, motionless.,When he came to a few minutes later,,he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.,It was Bull Walker.,The strongman had given the lion tamernmouth-to-mouth, and saved his life. 
 Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,,but he was actuallyna third-year medical student.,He toured with the circusnduring summers to pay tuition,,but kept it a secretnto protect his persona.,He was supposed to bena brute, a villain --,not a nerdy do-gooder.,His medical colleagues didn'tnknow his secret, either.,As he put it, "If you werenan athlete, you were a dumb dodo.",So he didn't tell them about the circus,,or about how he wrestled professionallynon evenings and weekends.,He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,,or later, the Masked Marvel.,He even kept it a secret that same year,,when he was crownednthe Light Heavyweight Champion,of the world. 
 Over the years, John J. Bonicanlived these parallel lives.,He was a wrestler;,he was a doctor.,He was a heel;,he was a hero.,He inflicted pain,,and he treated it.,And he didn’t know it at the time,nbut over the next five decades,,he'd draw on these dueling identities,to forge a whole new waynto think about pain.,It'd change modern medicinenso much so, that decades later,,Time magazine would call himnpain relief's founding father.,But that all happened later. 
 In 1942, Bonica graduatednmedical school and married Emma,,his sweetheart, whom he had metnat one of his matches years before.,He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.,His internship at New York'snSt. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.,With his championship belt,nhe wrestled in big-ticket venues,,like Madison Square Garden,,against big-time opponents,,like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall,,or three-time world champion,nAngelo Savoldi. 
 The matches took a toll on his body;,he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.,One night, The Terrible Turk's big toenscratched a scar like Capone's,down the side of his face.,The next morning at work,nhe had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.,Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R.nwith one eye so bruised,,he couldn't see out of it.,But worst of all werenhis mangled cauliflower ears.,He said they felt like two baseballsnon the sides of his head.,Pain just kept accumulating in his life. 
 Next, he watched his wife goninto labor at his hospital.,She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.,Her obstetrician callednout to the intern on duty,to give her a few drops of ethernto ease her pain.,But the intern was a young guy,njust three weeks on the job --,he was jittery, and in applying the ether,,irritated Emma's throat.,She vomited and choked,nand started to turn blue.,Bonica, who was watching all this,npushed the intern out of the way,,cleared her airway,,and saved his wifenand his unborn daughter.,At that moment, he decidednto devote his life to anesthesiology.,Later, he'd even go on to help developnthe epidural, for delivering mothers.,But before he could focus on obstetrics,,Bonica had to report for basic training. 
 Right around D-Day,,Bonica showed upnto Madigan Army Medical Center,,near Tacoma.,At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largestnarmy hospitals in America.,Bonica was in chargenof all pain control there.,He was only 27.,Treating so many patients,nBonica started noticing cases,that contradicted everythingnhe had learned.,Pain was supposed to bena kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --,a body's way of signaling an injury,nlike a broken arm.,But in some cases,,like after a patient had a leg amputated,,that patient might still complainnof pain in that nonexistent leg.,But if the injury had been treated, whynwould the alarm bell keep ringing?,There were other cases in which therenwas no evidence of an injury whatsoever,,and yet, still the patient hurt. 
 Bonica tracked down all the specialistsnat his hospital -- surgeons,,neurologists, psychiatrists, others.,And he tried to getntheir opinions on his patients.,It took too long, so he started organizingngroup meetings over lunch.,It would be like a tag team of specialistsngoing up against the patient's pain.,No one had ever focused on painnthis way before. 
 After that, he hit the books.,He read every medical textbooknhe could get his hands on,,carefully noting every mentionnof the word "pain.",Out of the 14,000 pages he read,,the word "pain" wasnon 17 and a half of them.,Seventeen and a half.,For the most basic, most common,nmost frustrating part of being a patient.,Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him,,he said, "What the hell kind of conclusionncan you come to there?,The most important thingnfrom the patient's perspective,,they don't talk about." 
 So over the next eight years,nBonica would talk about it.,He'd write about it; he'd writenthose missing pages.,He wrote what would later be knownnas the Bible of Pain.,In it he proposed new strategies,,new treatments usingnnerve-block injections.,He proposed a new institution,nthe Pain Clinic,,based on those lunchtime meetings.,But the most important thingnabout his book,was that it was kind of an emotionalnalarm bell for medicine.,A desperate plea to doctorsnto take pain seriously,in patients' lives.,He recast the very purpose of medicine.,The goal wasn't to make patients better;,it was to make patients feel better.,He pushed his pain agenda for decades,,before it finally took holdnin the mid-'70s.,Hundreds of pain clinics sprung upnall over the world. 
 But as they did -- a tragic twist.,Bonica's years of wrestlingncaught up to him.,He had been out of the ringnfor over 20 years,,but those 1,500 professional boutsnhad left a mark on his body.,Still in his mid-50s, he sufferednsevere osteoarthritis.,Over the next 20 yearsnhe'd have 22 surgeries,,including four spine operations,,and hip replacement after hip replacement.,He could barely raisenhis arm, turn his neck.,He needed aluminum crutches to walk.,His friends and former studentsnbecame his doctors.,One recalled that he probablynhad more nerve-block injections,than anyone else on the planet.,Already a workaholic,nhe worked even more --,15- to 18-hour days.,Healing others became morenthan just his job,,it was his own most effectivenform of relief.,"If I wasn't as busy as I am,"nhe told a reporter at the time,,"I would be a completely disabled guy." 
 On a business trip to Floridanin the early 1980s,,Bonica got a former student to drivenhim to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.,They drove past palm treesnand pulled up to an old mansion,,with giant silver howitzer cannonsnhidden in the garage.,The house belonged to the Zacchini family,,who were something likenAmerican circus royalty.,Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,,clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,,doing the act they pioneered --nthe Human Cannonball.,But now they were like him: retired.,That generation is all deadnnow, including Bonica,,so there's no way to know exactlynwhat they said that day.,But still, I love imagining it.,The strongman and the humanncannonballs reunited,,showing off old scars, and new ones.,Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.,Maybe he told them what he laternsaid in an oral history,,which is that his time in the circusnand wrestling deeply molded his life. 
 Bonica saw pain close up.,He felt it. He lived it.,And it made it impossiblenfor him to ignore in others.,Out of that empathy, he spunna whole new field,,played a major role in gettingnmedicine to acknowledge pain,in and of itself. 
 In that same oral history,,Bonica claimed that pain,is the most complex human experience.,That it involves your past life,nyour current life,,your interactions, your family.,That was definitely true for Bonica. 
 But it was also true for my mom.,It's easy for doctors to see my mom,as a kind of professional patient,,a woman who just spends her daysnin waiting rooms.,Sometimes I get stuck seeing hernthat same way.,But as I saw Bonica's pain --,a testament to his fully lived life --,I started to remember all the thingsnthat my mom's pain holds.,Before they got swollen and arthritic,,my mom's fingers clacked away,in the hospital H.R. departmentnwhere she worked.,They folded samosas for our entire mosque.,When I was a kid, they cut my hair,,wiped my nose,,tied my shoes. 
 Thank you.

 (Music) (Applause) 
 (Applause)Today, I am going to talk about anger.,When I was 11,,seeing some of my friends nleaving the school,because their parents ncould not afford textbooks,made me angry.,When I was 27,,hearing the plightnof a desperate slave father,whose daughter was nabout to be sold to a brothel,made me angry.,At the age of 50,,lying on the street,nin a pool of blood,,along with my own son,,made me angry. 
 Dear friends, for centuriesnwe were taught anger is bad.,Our parents, teachers, priests --,everyone taught us how to control nand suppress our anger.,But I ask why?,Why can't we convert our angernfor the larger good of society?,Why can't we use our anger,to challenge and changenthe evils of the world?,That I tried to do. 
 Friends,,most of the brightest ideasncame to my mind out of anger.,Like when I was 35 and sat nin a locked-up, tiny prison.,The whole night, I was angry.,But it has given birth to a new idea.,But I will come to that later on.,Let me begin with the storynof how I got a name for myself. 
 I had been a big admirer nof Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.,Gandhi fought and lead nIndia's freedom movement.,But more importantly,,he taught us how to treat nthe most vulnerable sections,,the most deprived people, nwith dignity and respect.,And so, when India was celebrating,Mahatma Gandhi's nbirth centenary in 1969 --,at that time I was 15 --,an idea came to my mind.,Why can't we celebrate it differently?,I knew, as perhapsnmany of you might know,,that in India, a large number of peoplenare born in the lowest segment of caste.,And they are treated as untouchables.,These are the people --,forget about allowing them nto go to the temples,,they cannot even go into the houses nand shops of high-caste people. 
 So I was very impressed with nthe leaders of my town,who were speaking very highly againstnthe caste system and untouchability,and talking of Gandhian ideals.,So inspired by that, I thought,nlet us set an example,by inviting these people to eat foodncooked and served,by the untouchable community.,I went to some low-caste,nso-called untouchable, people,,tried to convince them,nbut it was unthinkable for them.,They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.nIt never happened.",I said, "Look at these leaders,,they are so great, nthey are against untouchability.,They will come. If nobody comes, nwe can set an example.",These people thought that I was too naive.,Finally, they were convinced. 
 My friends and I took our bicyclesnand invited political leaders.,And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered,to see that each one of them nagreed to come.,I thought, "Great idea.nWe can set an example.,We can bring about change in the society." 
 The day has come.,All these untouchables,nthree women and two men,,they agreed to come.,I could recall that they had used nthe best of their clothes.,They brought new utensils.,They had taken baths nhundreds of times,because it was unthinkablenfor them to do.,It was the moment of change.,They gathered. Food was cooked.,It was 7 o'clock.,By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,,because it's not very uncommon nthat the leaders become late,,for an hour or so. 
 So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicyclesnand went to these leaders' homes,,just to remind them.,One of the leader's wives told me,,"Sorry, he is having some headache,nperhaps he cannot come.",I went to another leader,and his wife told me, n"Okay, you go, he will definitely join.",So I thought that the dinnernwill take place,,though not at that large a scale. 
 I went back to the venue, which wasna newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.,It was 10 o'clock.,None of the leaders showed up.,That made me angry.,I was standing, leaning againstnMahatma Gandhi's statue.,I was emotionally drained,nrather exhausted.,Then I sat down where nthe food was lying.,I kept my emotions on hold.,But then, when I took the first bite,,I broke down in tears.,And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.,And it was the healing, motherly touch nof an untouchable woman.,And she told me,n"Kailash, why are you crying?,You have done your bit.,You have eaten the foodncooked by untouchables,,which has never happened in our memory.",She said, "You won today.",And my friends, she was right. 
 I came back home, a little after midnight,,shocked to see that several nhigh-caste elderly people,were sitting in my courtyard.,I saw my mother and nelderly women were crying,and they were pleading nto these elderly people,because they had threatened nto outcaste my whole family.,And you know, outcasting the familynis the biggest social punishment,one can think of.,Somehow they agreed to punish only me,nand the punishment was purification.,That means I had to go 600 milesnaway from my hometown,to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.,And after that, I should organize a feastnfor priests, 101 priests,,wash their feet and drink that water. 
 It was total nonsense,,and I refused to accept that punishment.,How did they punish me?,I was barred from entering into my own nkitchen and my own dining room,,my utensils were separated.,But the night when I was angry,nthey wanted to outcaste me.,But I decided to outcaste nthe entire caste system.,(Applause) 
 And that was possible becausenthe beginning would have been,to change the family name, or surname,,because in India, most ofnthe family names are caste names.,So I decided to drop my name.,And then, later on, I gave na new name to myself: Satyarthi,,that means, "seeker of truth.",(Applause),And that was the beginning nof my transformative anger. 
 Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,,what was I doing before becomingna children's rights activist?,Does anybody know?,No.,I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.,And then I learned how the energy,of burning fire, coal,,the nuclear blast inside the chambers,,raging river currents,,fierce winds,,could be converted into the light nand lives of millions.,I also learned how the mostnuncontrollable form of energy,could be harnessed for good nand making society better. 
 So I'll come back to the storynof when I was caught in the prison:,I was very happy freeing na dozen children from slavery,,handing them over to their parents.,I cannot explain my joy nwhen I free a child.,I was so happy.,But when I was waiting for my trainnto come back to my hometown, Delhi,,I saw that dozens of children nwere arriving;,they were being trafficked by someone.,I stopped them, those people.,I complained to the police.,So the policemen, instead of helping me,,they threw me in this small, ntiny shell, like an animal.,And that was the night of anger,when one of the brightest nand biggest ideas was born.,I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 nchildren, and 50 more will join,,that's not done.,And I believed in the power of consumers,,and let me tell you that thisnwas the first time,when a campaign was launched by menor anywhere in the world,,to educate and sensitize the consumers,to create a demandnfor child-labor-free rugs.,In Europe and America, nwe have been successful.,And it has resulted nin a fall in child labor,in South Asian countries by 80 percent.,(Applause) 
 Not only that, but this first-ever nconsumer's power, or consumer's campaign,has grown in other countriesnand other industries,,maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, nmaybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.,My anger at the age of 11,,when I realized how importantneducation is for every child,,I got an idea to collect used booksnand help the poorest children.,I created a book bank at the age of 11.,But I did not stop.,Later on, I cofounded,the world's single largest civil societyncampaign for education,that is the Global Campaign for Education.,That has helped in changing nthe whole thinking towards education,from the charity modento the human rights mode,,and that has concretely helped nthe reduction of out-of-school children,by half in the last 15 years.,(Applause) 
 My anger at the age of 27,,to free that girl who was aboutnto be sold to a brothel,,has given me an idea,to go for a new strategynof raid and rescue,,freeing children from slavery.,And I am so lucky and proud to saynthat it is not one or 10 or 20,,but my colleagues and I have been ablento physically liberate 83,000 child slaves,and hand them overnback to their families and mothers.,(Applause) 
 I knew that we needed global policies.,We organized the worldwide marchesnagainst child labor,and that has also resulted in na new international convention,to protect the childrennwho are in the worst forms.,And the concrete result was thatnthe number of child laborers globally,has gone down by one third nin the last 15 years.,(Applause) 
 So, in each case,,it began from anger,,turned into an idea,,and action.,So anger, what next?,Idea, and --,Audience: Action,Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.nWhich I tried to do. 
 Anger is a power, anger is an energy,,and the law of nature is that energy,can never be created and never nbe vanished, can never be destroyed.,So why can't the energy of angernbe translated and harnessed,to create a better and beautiful world,na more just and equitable world? 
 Anger is within each one of you,,and I will share a secretnfor a few seconds:,that if we are confined in nthe narrow shells of egos,,and the circles of selfishness,,then the anger will turn out to benhatred, violence, revenge, destruction.,But if we are able to break the circles,,then the same anger could turn ninto a great power.,We can break the circles nby using our inherent compassion,and connect with the world through ncompassion to make this world better.,That same anger could bentransformed into it. 
 So dear friends, sisters and brothers,nagain, as a Nobel Laureate,,I am urging you to become angry.,I am urging you to become angry.,And the angriest among us,is the one who can transform his anger ninto idea and action. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: For many years, nyou've been an inspiration to others.,Who or what inspires you and why? 
 KS: Good question.,Chris, let me tell you, nand that is the truth,,each time when I free a child,,the child who has lost all his hopenthat he will ever come back to his mother,,the first smile of freedom,,and the mother who has lost all hope,that the son or daughter ncan ever come back and sit in her lap,,they become so emotional,and the first tear of joy nrolls down on her cheek,,I see the glimpse of God in it --nthis is my biggest inspiration.,And I am so lucky that not once,nas I said before, but thousands of times,,I have been able to witness my Godnin the faces of those children,and they are my biggest inspirations.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is my great uncle,,my father's father's younger brother.,His name was Joe McKenna.,He was a young husbandnand a semi-pro basketball player,and a fireman in New York City.,Family history saysnhe loved being a fireman,,and so in 1938, on one of his days off,,he elected to hang out at the firehouse.,To make himself useful that day,nhe started polishing all the brass,,the railings on the fire truck,nthe fittings on the walls,,and one of the fire hose nozzles,,a giant, heavy piece of metal,,toppled off a shelf and hit him.,A few days later,nhis shoulder started to hurt.,Two days after that, he spiked a fever.,The fever climbed and climbed.,His wife was taking care of him,,but nothing she did made a difference,nand when they got the local doctor in,,nothing he did mattered either. 
 They flagged down a cabnand took him to the hospital.,The nurses there recognized right awaynthat he had an infection,,what at the time they wouldnhave called "blood poisoning,",and though they probably didn't say it,,they would have known right away,that there was nothing they could do. 
 There was nothing they could donbecause the things we use now,to cure infections didn't exist yet.,The first test of penicillin,nthe first antibiotic,,was three years in the future.,People who got infectionsneither recovered, if they were lucky,,or they died.,My great uncle was not lucky.,He was in the hospital for a week,nshaking with chills,,dehydrated and delirious,,sinking into a coma as his organs failed.,His condition grew so desperate,that the people from his firehousenlined up to give him transfusions,hoping to dilute the infectionnsurging through his blood. 
 Nothing worked. He died.,He was 30 years old. 
 If you look back through history,,most people died the waynmy great uncle died.,Most people didn't dienof cancer or heart disease,,the lifestyle diseases that afflict usnin the West today.,They didn't die of those diseasesnbecause they didn't live long enough,to develop them.,They died of injuries --,being gored by an ox,,shot on a battlefield,,crushed in one of the new factoriesnof the Industrial Revolution --,and most of the time from infection,,which finished what those injuries began. 
 All of that changednwhen antibiotics arrived.,Suddenly, infections that hadnbeen a death sentence,became somethingnyou recovered from in days.,It seemed like a miracle,,and ever since, we have been living insidenthe golden epoch of the miracle drugs. 
 And now, we are coming to an end of it.,My great uncle died in the last daysnof the pre-antibiotic era.,We stand today on the thresholdnof the post-antibiotic era,,in the earliest days of a timenwhen simple infections,such as the one Joe hadnwill kill people once again. 
 In fact, they already are.,People are dying of infections againnbecause of a phenomenon,called antibiotic resistance.,Briefly, it works like this.,Bacteria compete against each othernfor resources, for food,,by manufacturing lethal compoundsnthat they direct against each other.,Other bacteria, to protect themselves,,evolve defenses againstnthat chemical attack.,When we first made antibiotics,,we took those compounds into the labnand made our own versions of them,,and bacteria responded to our attacknthe way they always had. 
 Here is what happened next:,Penicillin was distributed in 1943,,and widespread penicillin resistancenarrived by 1945.,Vancomycin arrived in 1972,,vancomycin resistance in 1988.,Imipenem in 1985,,and resistance to in 1998.,Daptomycin, one ofnthe most recent drugs, in 2003,,and resistance to itnjust a year later in 2004. 
 For 70 years, we playedna game of leapfrog --,our drug and their resistance,,and then another drug,nand then resistance again --,and now the game is ending.,Bacteria develop resistance so quicklynthat pharmaceutical companies,have decided making antibioticsnis not in their best interest,,so there are infectionsnmoving across the world,for which, out of the morenthan 100 antibiotics,available on the market,,two drugs might work with side effects,,or one drug,,or none. 
 This is what that looks like.,In 2000, the Centers for DiseasenControl and Prevention, the CDC,,identified a single case,in a hospital in North Carolina,of an infection resistantnto all but two drugs.,Today, that infection, known as KPC,,has spread to every state but three,,and to South America, Europe,and the Middle East.,In 2008, doctors in Sweden,diagnosed a man from Indianwith a different infection,resistant to all but one drug that time.,The gene that creates that resistance,,known as NDM, has now spreadnfrom India into China, Asia, Africa,,Europe and Canada, and the United States. 
 It would be natural to hope,that these infectionsnare extraordinary cases,,but in fact,,in the United States and Europe,,50,000 people a year,die of infections which no drugs can help.,A project charterednby the British government,known as the Reviewnon Antimicrobial Resistance,estimates that the worldwide tollnright now is 700,000 deaths a year. 
 That is a lot of deaths,,and yet, the chances are goodnthat you don't feel at risk,,that you imagine these peoplenwere hospital patients,in intensive care units,or nursing home residentsnnear the ends of their lives,,people whose infectionsnare remote from us,,in situations we can't identify with. 
 What you didn't think about,nnone of us do,,is that antibiotics supportnalmost all of modern life. 
 If we lost antibiotics,,here's what else we'd lose:,First, any protection for peoplenwith weakened immune systems --,cancer patients, AIDS patients,,transplant recipients, premature babies. 
 Next, any treatment that installsnforeign objects in the body:,stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,,dialysis, joint replacements.,How many athletic baby boomersnneed new hips and knees?,A recent study estimatesnthat without antibiotics,,one out of ever six would die. 
 Next, we'd probably lose surgery.,Many operations are preceded,by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.,Without that protection,,we'd lose the ability to opennthe hidden spaces of the body.,So no heart operations,,no prostate biopsies,,no Cesarean sections.,We'd have to learn to fear infectionsnthat now seem minor.,Strep throat used to cause heart failure.,Skin infections led to amputations.,Giving birth killed,nin the cleanest hospitals,,almost one woman out of every 100.,Pneumonia took three childrennout of every 10. 
 More than anything else,,we'd lose the confident waynwe live our everyday lives.,If you knew that any injuryncould kill you,,would you ride a motorcycle,,bomb down a ski slope,,climb a ladder to hangnyour Christmas lights,,let your kid slide into home plate?,After all, the first personnto receive penicillin,,a British policeman namednAlbert Alexander,,who was so ravaged by infectionnthat his scalp oozed pus,and doctors had to take out an eye,,was infected by doingnsomething very simple.,He walked into his gardennand scratched his face on a thorn.,That British project I mentionednwhich estimates that the worldwide toll,right now is 700,000 deaths a year,also predicts that if we can'tnget this under control by 2050,,not long, the worldwide tollnwill be 10 million deaths a year. 
 How did we get to this point,where what we have to look forward to,is those terrifying numbers?,The difficult answer is,nwe did it to ourselves.,Resistance is an inevitablenbiological process,,but we bear the responsibilitynfor accelerating it.,We did this by squandering antibiotics,with a heedlessnessnthat now seems shocking.,Penicillin was soldnover the counter until the 1950s.,In much of the developing world,nmost antibiotics still are.,In the United States, 50 percent,of the antibiotics givennin hospitals are unnecessary.,Forty-five percent of the prescriptionsnwritten in doctor's offices,are for conditionsnthat antibiotics cannot help.,And that's just in healthcare.,On much of the planet, most meat animalsnget antibiotics every day of their lives,,not to cure illnesses,,but to fatten them upnand to protect them against,the factory farm conditionsnthey are raised in.,In the United States, possibly 80 percent,of the antibiotics sold every yearngo to farm animals, not to humans,,creating resistant bacterianthat move off the farm,in water, in dust,,in the meat the animals become.,Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,,particularly in Asia,,and fruit growing relies on antibiotics,to protect apples, pears,ncitrus, against disease.,And because bacteria can passntheir DNA to each other,like a traveler handing offna suitcase at an airport,,once we have encouragednthat resistance into existence,,there is no knowing where it will spread. 
 This was predictable.,In fact, it was predicted,by Alexander Fleming,nthe man who discovered penicillin.,He was given the Nobel Prizenin 1945 in recognition,,and in an interview shortly after,nthis is what he said: 
 "The thoughtless person playingnwith penicillin treatment,is morally responsiblenfor the death of a man,who succumbs to infection,with a pencillin-resistant organism.",He added, "I hope this evilncan be averted." 
 Can we avert it?,There are companies workingnon novel antibiotics,,things the superbugsnhave never seen before.,We need those new drugs badly,,and we need incentives:,discovery grants, extended patents,,prizes, to lure other companiesninto making antibiotics again. 
 But that probably won't be enough.,Here's why: Evolution always wins.,Bacteria birth a new generationnevery 20 minutes.,It takes pharmaceutical chemistryn10 years to derive a new drug.,Every time we use an antibiotic,,we give the bacteria billions of chances,to crack the codes,of the defenses we've constructed.,There has never yet been a drug,they could not defeat. 
 This is asymmetric warfare,,but we can change the outcome.,We could build systems to harvest datanto tell us automatically and specifically,how antibiotics are being used.,We could build gatekeepingninto drug order systems,so that every prescriptionngets a second look.,We could require agriculturento give up antibiotic use.,We could build surveillance systems,to tell us where resistancenis emerging next. 
 Those are the tech solutions.,They probably aren't enough either,,unless we help.,Antibiotic resistance is a habit.,We all know how hard it isnto change a habit.,But as a society,nwe've done that in the past.,People used to toss litterninto the streets,,used to not wear seatbelts,,used to smoke inside public buildings.,We don't do those things anymore.,We don't trash the environment,or court devastating accidents,or expose othersnto the possibility of cancer,,because we decided those thingsnwere expensive,,destructive, not in our best interest.,We changed social norms.,We could change social normsnaround antibiotic use too. 
 I know that the scalenof antibiotic resistance,seems overwhelming,,but if you've ever boughtna fluorescent lightbulb,because you were concernednabout climate change,,or read the label on a box of crackers,because you think aboutnthe deforestation from palm oil,,you already know what it feels like,to take a tiny step to addressnan overwhelming problem.,We could take those kinds of stepsnfor antibiotic use too.,We could forgo giving an antibioticnif we're not sure it's the right one.,We could stop insisting on a prescriptionnfor our kid's ear infection,before we're sure what caused it.,We could ask every restaurant,,every supermarket,,where their meat comes from.,We could promise each other,never again to buy chickennor shrimp or fruit,raised with routine antibiotic use,,and if we did those things,,we could slow down the arrivalnof the post-antibiotic world. 
 But we have to do it soon.,Penicillin begannthe antibiotic era in 1943.,In just 70 years, we walked ourselvesnup to the edge of disaster.,We won't get 70 years,to find our way back out again. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I know what you're thinking:,"Why does that guy get to sit down?",That's because this is radio. 
 (Music) 
 I tell radio stories about design,,and I report on all kinds of stories:,buildings and toothbrushes,nmascots and wayfinding and fonts.,My mission is to get people to engagenwith the design that they care about,so they begin to pay attentionnto all forms of design.,When you decode the worldnwith design intent in mind,,the world becomes kind of magical.,Instead of seeing the broken things,,you see all the little bits of genius,that anonymous designers have sweated overnto make our lives better.,And that's essentiallynthe definition of design:,making life better and providing joy.,And few things give me greater joy,than a well-designed flag. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah! 
 (Applause) 
 Happy 50th anniversarynon your flag, Canada.,It is beautiful, gold standard.,Love it. 
 I'm kind of obsessed with flags.,Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags,,and people are like,n"I don't care about flags,",and then we start talkingnabout flags, and trust me,,100 percent of people care about flags.,There's just something about themnthat works on our emotions. 
 My family wrapped my Christmas presentsnas flags this year,,including the blue gift bagnthat's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.,I put this picture online,nand sure enough,,within the first few minutes,nsomeone left a comment that said,,"You can take that Scottish Saltirenand shove it up your ass." 
 (Laughter) 
 See, people are passionatenabout flags, you know?,That's the way it is. 
 What I love about flags,is that once you understandnthe design of flags,,what makes a good flag,nwhat makes a bad flag,,you can understandnthe design of almost anything.,So what I'm going to do here is,,I cracked open an episodenof my radio show,,"99\% Invisible," and I'm goingnto reconstruct it here on stage,,so when I press a button over here --,Voice: S for Sound --,Roman Mars: It's going to make a sound,,and so whenever you hear a soundnor a voice or a piece of music,,it's because I pressed a button. 
 Voice: Sound. 
 RM: All right, got it? Here we go.,Three, two. 
 This is 99\% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars. 
 (Music) 
 Narrator: The five basicnprinciples of flag design. 
 Roman Mars: According to the NorthnAmerican Vexillological Association.,Vexillological. 
 Ted Kaye: Vexillologynis the study of flags. 
 RM: It's that extra "lol"nthat makes it sound weird. 
 Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.,The flag should be so simplenthat a child can draw it from memory. 
 RM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,,I didn't even know citiesnhad their own flags. 
 TK: Most larger cities do have flags. 
 RM: Well, I didn't know that,nthat's Ted Kaye, by the way. 
 TK: Hello.,RM: He's a flag expert,nhe's a totally awesome guy. 
 TK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have editedna scholarly journal on flag studies,,and I am currently involvednwith the Portland Flag Association,and the North AmericannVexillological Association. 
 RM: Ted literally wrotenthe book on flag design. 
 Narrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag." 
 RM: It's more of a pamphlet, really,nit's about 16 pages. 
 TK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag:nHow to Design a Great Flag." 
 RM: And that first city flagnI discovered in Chicago,is a beaut:,white field, two horizontal blue stripes,,and four six-pointed red starsndown the middle. 
 (Sound) 
 Narrator: Number two,nuse meaningful symbolism. 
 TK: The blue stripes representnthe water, the river and the lake. 
 Narrator: The flag's images,ncolors or pattern,should relate to what it symbolizes. 
 TK: The red stars representnsignificant events in Chicago's history. 
 RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearbornnon the future site of Chicago,,the Great Chicago Fire,,the World Columbian Exposition,nwhich everyone remembers,because of the White City,,and the Century of Progress Exposition,nwhich no one remembers at all. 
 Narrator: Number three,nuse two to three basic colors. 
 TK: The basic rule for colorsnis to use two to three colors,from the standard color set:nred, white, blue, green, yellow and black. 
 RM: The design of the Chicago flagnhas complete buy-in,with an entire cross-section of the city.,It is everywhere;,every municipal building flies the flag. 
 Whet Moser: There's probablynat least one store on every block,near where I work that sellsnsome sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia. 
 RM: That's Whet Mosernfrom Chicago magazine. 
 WM: Today, just for example,nI went to get a haircut,,and when I sat down in the barber's chair,,there was a Chicago flag on the boxnthat the barber kept all his tools in,,and then in the mirror, there wasna Chicago flag on the wall behind me.,When I left, a guy passed me who hadna Chicago flag badge on his backpack. 
 RM: It's adaptable and remixable.,The six-pointed stars in particularnshow up in all kinds of places. 
 WM: The coffee I bought the other daynhad a Chicago star on it. 
 RM: It's a distinct symbolnof Chicago pride. 
 TK: When a police officernor a firefighter dies in Chicago,,often it's not the flagnof the United States on his casket.,It can be the flag of the city of Chicago.,That's how deeply the flag has gottenninto the civic imagery of Chicago. 
 RM: And it isn't just that peoplenlove Chicago and therefore love the flag.,I also think that people love Chicago morenbecause the flag is so cool. 
 TK: A positive feedback loop therenbetween great symbolism and civic pride. 
 RM: OK, so when I moved backnto San Francisco in 2008,,I researched its flag,,because I had never seen itnin the previous eight years I lived there.,And I found it, I am sorry to say,,sadly lacking. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know.,It hurts me, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 TK: Well, let me start from the top. 
 Narrator: Number one, keep it simple. 
 TK: Keeping it simple. 
 Narrator: The flag should be so simplenthat a child can draw it from memory. 
 TK: It's a relatively complex flag. 
 RM: OK, here we go, OK.,The main componentnof the San Francisco flag is a phoenix,representing the citynrising from the ashes,after the devastating fires of the 1850s. 
 TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco. 
 RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.,Design-wise, it managesnto both be too crude,and have too many detailsnat the same time,,which if you were trying for that,,you wouldn't be able to do it,,and it just looks bad at a distance,,but having deep meaningnputs that element in the plus column.,Behind the phoenix,nthe background is mostly white,,and then it has a substantialngold border around it. 
 TK: Which is a very attractivendesign element. 
 RM: I think it's OK, but -- 
 (Laughter),here come the big no-nos of flag design. 
 Narrator: Number four,nno lettering or seals.,Never use writing of any kind. 
 RM: Underneath the phoenix,nthere's a motto on a ribbon,that translates ton"Gold in peace, iron in war,",plus -- and this is the big problem --,it says San Francisco across the bottom. 
 TK: If you need to write the namenof what you're representing on your flag,,your symbolism has failed. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 RM: The United States flagndoesn't say "USA" across the front.,In fact, country flags,nthey tend to behave.,Like, hats off to South Africanand Turkey and Israel,and Somalia and Japan and Gambia.,There's a bunchnof really great country flags,,but they obey good design principlesnbecause the stakes are high.,They're on the international stage.,But city, state and regional flagsnare another story. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is a scourge of bad flags -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and they must be stopped. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 That is the truth and that is the dare.,The first step is to recognizenthat we have a problem. 
 (Laughter) 
 A lot of people tend to thinknthat good design,is just a matter of taste,,and quite honestly,nsometimes it is, actually,,but sometimes it isn't, all right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's the full list of NAVAnflag design principles. 
 Narrator: The fivenbasic principles of flag design. 
 Narrator: Number one.nTK: Keep it simple. 
 Narrator: Number two.nTK: Use meaningful symbolism. 
 Narrator: Number three.nTK: Use two to three basic colors. 
 Narrator: Number four.nTK: No lettering or seals. 
 Narrator: Never use writing of any kind. 
 TK: Because you can'tnread that at a distance. 
 Narrator: Number five.nTK: And be distinctive. 
 RM: All the best flags tendnto stick to these principles.,And like I said before,nmost country flags are OK.,But here's the thing:,if you showed this list of principlesnto any designer of almost anything,,they would say these principles --nsimplicity, deep meaning,,having few colorsnor being thoughtful about colors,,uniqueness, don't havenwriting you can't read --,all those principles apply to them, too.,But sadly, good design principlesnare rarely invoked in US city flags.,Our biggest problemnseems to be that fourth one.,We just can't stop ourselvesnfrom putting our names on our flags,,or little municipal sealsnwith tiny writing on them.,Here's the thing about municipal seals:,They were designednto be on pieces of paper,where you can read them,,not on flags 100 feet awaynflapping in the breeze. 
 So here's a bunch of flags again.,Vexillologists call these SOBs:,Seals on a bedsheet -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and if you can't tellnwhat city they go to,,yeah, that's exactly the problem,,except for Anaheim,napparently, they fixed it. 
 (Laughter) 
 These flags are everywhere in the US.,The European equivalentnof the municipal seal,is the city coat of arms ...,and this is where we can learnna lesson for how to do things right.,So this is the cityncoat of arms of Amsterdam.,Now, if this were a United States city,,the flag would probably look like this.,You know, yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 But instead, the flag of Amsterdam,looks like this.,Rather than ploppingnthe whole coat of arms,on a solid background and writingn"Amsterdam" below it,,they just take the key elementsnof the escutcheon, the shield,,and they turn it into the mostnbadass city flag in the world. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And because it's so badass,,those flags and crossesnare found throughout Amsterdam,,just like Chicago, they're used. 
 Even though seal-on-a-bedsheet flagsnare particularly painful,and offensive to me,,nothing can quite prepare you,for one of the biggest train wrecksnin vexillological history. 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you ready?,It's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, it's distinctive,,I'll give them that. 
 Steve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955. 
 RM: The city ran a contest,and gathered a bunch of submissionsnwith all kinds of designs. 
 SK: And an aldermannby the name of Fred Steffan,cobbled together parts of the submissionsnto make what is now the Milwaukee flag. 
 RM: It's a kitchen sink flag.,There's a gigantic gearnrepresenting industry,,there's a ship recognizing the port,,a giant stalk of wheat,paying homage to the brewing industry.,It's a hot mess,,and Steve Kodis, a graphic designernfrom Milwaukee, wants to change it. 
 SK: It's really awful.,It's a misstep on the city's behalf,,to say the least. 
 RM: But what putsnthe Milwaukee flag over the top,,almost to the point of self-parody,,is on it is a picture of the Civil Warnbattle flag of the Milwaukee regiment. 
 SK: So that's the final element in it,that just makes itnthat much more ridiculous,,that there is a flag designnwithin the Milwaukee flag. 
 RM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. 
 (Music) 
 Now, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.,I've been there, I love it.,The most depressing partnof this flag, though,,is that there have beenntwo major redesign contests.,The last one was held in 2001.,105 entries were received. 
 TK: But in the end, the membersnof the Milwaukee Arts Board,decided that none of the new entriesnwere worthy of flying over the city. 
 RM: They couldn't agreento change that thing! 
 (Laughter) 
 That's discouraging enoughnto make you think,that good design and democracynjust simply do not go together. 
 (Laughter) 
 But Steve Kotas is goingnto try one more time,to redesign the Milwaukee flag. 
 SK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.,Every great city deserves a great flag. 
 RM: Steve isn't readynto reveal his design yet.,One of the things aboutnproposing one of these things,is you have to get people on board,,and then you reveal your design.,But here's the trick:,If you want to design a great flag,,a kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's,nwhich also has a great flag,,start by drawingna one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle,on a piece of paper.,Your design has to fitnwithin that tiny rectangle.,Here's why. 
 TK: A three-by-five-foot flagnon a pole 100 feet away,looks about the same sizenas a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle,seen about 15 inches from your eye.,You'd be surprised by how compellingnand simple the design can be,when you hold yourself to that limitation. 
 RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.,Is there anything we can do? 
 TK: I like to say that in every bad flagnthere's a good flag trying to get out.,The way to makenSan Francisco's flag a good flag,is to take the motto offnbecause you can't read that at a distance.,Take the name off,,and the border might even be made thicker,nso it's more a part of the flag.,And I would simply take the phoenix,and make it a great big elementnin the middle of the flag. 
 RM: But the current phoenix,nthat's got to go. 
 TK: I would simplifynor stylize the phoenix.,Depict a big, wide-winged bird,coming out of flames.,Emphasize those flames. 
 RM: So this San Francisco flagnwas designed by Frank Chimero,based on Ted Kaye's suggestions.,I don't know what he would donif we was completely unfettered,and didn't follow those guidelines.,Fans of my radio show and podcast,nheard me complain about bad flags.,They've sent me other suggested designs.,This one's by Neil Mussett.,Both are so much better. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think if they were adopted,,I would see them around the city. 
 In my crusade to makenflags of the world more beautiful,,many listeners have taken itnupon themselves,to redesign their flagsnand look into the feasibility,of getting them officially adopted. 
 (Music) 
 If you see your city flag and like it,,fly it,,even if it violates a design rule or two.,I don't care.,But if you don't see your city flag,,maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,,and it just sucks,,and I dare you to join the effortnto try to change that. 
 As we move more and more into cities,,the city flag will becomennot just a symbol of that city as a place,,but also, it could become a symbolnof how that city considers design itself,,especially today, as the populacenis becoming more design-aware.,And I think design awarenessnis at an all-time high.,A well-designed flag could be seennas an indicator of how a city,considers all of its design systems:,its public transit,,its parks, its signage.,It might seem frivolous, but it's not. 
 TK: Often when city leaders say,,"We have more important things to donthan worry about a city flag,",my response is,,"If you had a great city flag,,you would have a bannernfor people to rally under,to face those more important things." 
 (Music) 
 RM: I've seen firsthandnwhat a good city flag can do,in the case of Chicago.,The marriage of good designnand civic pride,is something that we need in all places.,The best part about municipal flagsnis that we own them.,They are an open-source,,publicly owned design languagenof the community.,When they are done well,,they are remixable, adaptable,nand they are powerful.,We could control the brandingnand graphical imagery,of our cities with a good flag,,but instead, by havingnbad flags we don't use,,we cede that territory to sports teams,and chambers of commercenand tourism boards.,Sports teams can leavenand break our hearts.,And besides, some of usndon't really care about sports.,And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.,But a great city flag,is something that representsna city to its people,and its people to the world at large.,And when that flag is a beautiful thing,,that connection is a beautiful thing. 
 So maybe all the city flagsncan be as inspiring as Hong Kong,or Portland or Trondheim,,and we can do away with all the bad flags,like San Francisco, Milwaukee,nCedar Rapids,,and finally, when we're all done,,we can do somethingnabout Pocatello, Idaho,,considered by the North AmericannVexillological Association,as the worst city flag in North America. 
 [Proud to be Pocatello] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 That thing has a trademarknsymbol on it, people. 
 (Laughter) 
 That hurts me just to look at. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you so much for listening. 
 (Applause) 
 [Music by: Melodium (@melodiumbox)nand Keegan DeWitt (@keegandewitt)]I'd like to have you look at this pencil.,It's a thing. It's a legal thing.,And so are books you might havenor the cars you own.,They're all legal things.,The great apes that you'll see behind me,,they too are legal things. 
 Now, I can do that to a legal thing.,I can do whatever I wantnto my book or my car.,These great apes, you'll see.,The photographs are taken by a mannnamed James Mollison,who wrote a book calledn"James & Other Apes.",And he tells in his booknhow every single one them,,almost every one of them, is an orphan,who saw his mother and fatherndie before his eyes.,They're legal things. 
 So for centuries, there's beenna great legal wall,that separates legal thingsnfrom legal persons.,On one hand, legal thingsnare invisible to judges.,They don't count in law.,They don't have any legal rights.,They don't haventhe capacity for legal rights.,They are the slaves.,On the other side of that legal wallnare the legal persons.,Legal persons are very visible to judges.,They count in law.,They may have many rights.,They have the capacitynfor an infinite number of rights.,And they're the masters.,Right now, all nonhuman animalsnare legal things.,All human beings are legal persons. 
 But being human and being a legal person,has never been, and is not today,nsynonymous with a legal person.,Humans and legal personsnare not synonymous.,On the one side,,there have been many human beingsnover the centuries,who have been legal things.,Slaves were legal things.,Women, children,nwere sometimes legal things.,Indeed, a great deal of civil rightsnstruggle over the last centuries,has been to punch a holenthrough that wall and begin to feed,these human things through the wallnand have them become legal persons. 
 But alas, that hole has closed up.,Now, on the other side are legal persons,,but they've never only beennlimited to human beings.,There are, for example, there are manynlegal persons who are not even alive.,In the United States,,we're aware of the factnthat corporations are legal persons.,In pre-independence India,,a court held that a Hindu idolnwas a legal person,,that a mosque was a legal person.,In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court,held that the holy booksnof the Sikh religion was a legal person,,and in 2012, just recently,,there was a treaty betweennthe indigenous peoples of New Zealand,and the crown, in which it was agreednthat a river was a legal person,who owned its own riverbed. 
 Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,,when I had a full headnof lush, brown hair,,and indeed I was moved by it,,because I had become a lawyer becausenI wanted to speak for the voiceless,,defend the defenseless,,and I'd never realized how voicelessnand defenseless the trillions,,billions of nonhuman animals are.,And I began to worknas an animal protection lawyer.,And by 1985, I realized that I was tryingnto accomplish something,that was literally impossible,,the reason being that all of my clients,,all the animals whose interestsnI was trying to defend,,were legal things; they were invisible.,It was not going to work, so I decided,that the only thing that was going to worknwas they had, at least some of them,,had to also be moved through a holenthat we could open up again in that wall,and begin feeding the appropriatennonhuman animals through that hole,onto the other sidenof being legal persons. 
 Now, at that time, there wasnvery little known about or spoken about,truly animal rights,,about the idea of having legal personhoodnor legal rights for a nonhuman animal,,and I knew it was goingnto take a long time.,And so, in 1985, I figured that itnwould take about 30 years,before we'd be able to even beginna strategic litigation,,long-term campaign, in order to be ablento punch another hole through that wall.,It turned out that I was pessimistic,nthat it only took 28. 
 So what we had to do in ordernto begin was not only,to write law review articlesnand teach classes, write books,,but we had to then beginnto get down to the nuts and bolts,of how you litigate that kind of case. 
 So one of the first things we needed to donwas figure out what a cause of action was,,a legal cause of action.,And a legal cause of actionnis a vehicle that lawyers use,to put their arguments in front of courts. 
 It turns out there'sna very interesting case,that had occurred almost 250 years agonin London called Somerset vs. Stewart,,whereby a black slavenhad used the legal system,and had moved from a legal thingnto a legal person.,I was so interested in it that Ineventually wrote an entire book about it. 
 James Somerset was an eight-year-old boynwhen he was kidnapped from West Africa.,He survived the Middle Passage,,and he was sold to a Scottish businessmannnamed Charles Stewart in Virginia.,Now, 20 years later, Stewartnbrought James Somerset to London,,and after he got there, James decidednhe was going to escape.,And so one of the first things he didnwas to get himself baptized,,because he wanted to getna set of godparents,,because to an 18th-century slave,,they knew that one of the majornresponsibilities of godfathers,was to help you escape. 
 And so in the fall of 1771,,James Somerset had a confrontationnwith Charles Stewart.,We don't know exactly what happened,nbut then James dropped out of sight.,An enraged Charles Stewartnthen hired slave catchers,to canvass the city of London,,find him, bring himnnot back to Charles Stewart,,but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,nthat was floating in London Harbour,,and he was chained to the deck,,and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica,where James was to be soldnin the slave markets,and be doomed to the three to fivenyears of life that a slave had,harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.,Well now James' godparentsnswung into action.,They approached the most powerful judge,,Lord Mansfield, who was chief judgenof the court of King's Bench,,and they demanded that he issuena common law writ of habeus corpus,on behalf of James Somerset. 
 Now, the common law is the kind of lawnthat English-speaking judges can make,when they're not cabined innby statutes or constitutions,,and a writ of habeus corpusnis called the Great Writ,,capital G, capital W,,and it's meant to protect any of usnwho are detained against our will.,A writ of habeus corpus is issued.,The detainer is requirednto bring the detainee in,and give a legally sufficient reasonnfor depriving him of his bodily liberty. 
 Well, Lord Mansfield had to makena decision right off the bat,,because if James Somersetnwas a legal thing,,he was not eligiblenfor a writ of habeus corpus,,only if he could be a legal person.,So Lord Mansfield decidednthat he would assume,,without deciding, that James Somersetnwas indeed a legal person,,and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,nand James's body was brought in,by the captain of the ship. 
 There were a series of hearingsnover the next six months.,On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfieldnsaid that slavery was so odious,,and he used the word "odious,",that the common law would not support it,nand he ordered James free.,At that moment, James Somersetnunderwent a legal transubstantiation.,The free man who walkednout of the courtroom,looked exactly like the slavenwho had walked in,,but as far as the law was concerned,nthey had nothing whatsoever in common. 
 The next thing we did is thatnthe Nonhuman Rights Project,,which I founded, then began to look atnwhat kind of values and principles,do we want to put before the judges?,What values and principlesndid they imbibe with their mother's milk,,were they taught in law school,ndo they use every day,,do they believe with all their hearts --nand we chose liberty and equality. 
 Now, liberty right is the kind of rightnto which you're entitled,because of how you're put together,,and a fundamental liberty rightnprotects a fundamental interest.,And the supreme interest in the common law,are the rights to autonomynand self-determination.,So they are so powerful thatnin a common law country,,if you go to a hospital and you refusenlife-saving medical treatment,,a judge will not order it forced upon you,,because they will respectnyour self-determination and your autonomy. 
 Now, an equality right is the kindnof right to which you're entitled,because you resemble someone elsenin a relevant way,,and there's the rub, relevant way.,So if you are that, then becausenthey have the right, you're like them,,you're entitled to the right.,Now, courts and legislaturesndraw lines all the time.,Some are included, some are excluded.,But you have to,nat the bare minimum you must --,that line has to be a reasonable meansnto a legitimate end.,The Nonhuman Rights Projectnargues that drawing a line,in order to enslave an autonomousnand self-determining being,like you're seeing behind me,,that that's a violation of equality. 
 We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,,it took us seven years,nto find the jurisdiction,where we wanted to beginnfiling our first suit.,We chose the state of New York.,Then we decided uponnwho our plaintiffs are going to be.,We decided upon chimpanzees,,not just because Jane Goodallnwas on our board of directors,,but because they, Jane and others,,have studied chimpanzeesnintensively for decades.,We know the extraordinaryncognitive capabilities that they have,,and they also resemble the kindnthat human beings have.,And so we chose chimpanzees,nand we began to then canvass the world,to find the expertsnin chimpanzee cognition.,We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,nScotland, England and the United States,,and amongst them, they wroten100 pages of affidavits,in which they set out more than 40 ways,in which their complexncognitive capability,,either individually or together,,all added up to autonomynand self-determination. 
 Now, these included, for example,nthat they were conscious.,But they're also consciousnthat they're conscious.,They know they have a mind.nThey know that others have minds.,They know they're individuals,nand that they can live.,They understand that they lived yesterdaynand they will live tomorrow.,They engage in mental time travel.nThey remember what happened yesterday.,They can anticipate tomorrow,,which is why it's so terrible to imprisonna chimpanzee, especially alone.,It's the thing that we donto our worst criminals,,and we do that to chimpanzeesnwithout even thinking about it. 
 They have some kind of moral capacity.,When they play economic gamesnwith human beings,,they'll spontaneously make fair offers,neven when they're not required to do so.,They are numerate.nThey understand numbers.,They can do some simple math.,They can engage in language --nor to stay out of the language wars,,they're involved in intentionalnand referential communication,in which they pay attentionnto the attitudes of those,with whom they are speaking.,They have culture.,They have a material culture,na social culture.,They have a symbolic culture.,Scientists in the Taï Forestsnin the Ivory Coast,found chimpanzees who were usingnthese rocks to smash open,the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.,It takes a long timento learn how to do that,,and they excavated the areanand they found,that this material culture,nthis way of doing it,,these rocks, had passed downnfor at least 4,300 years,through 225 chimpanzee generations. 
 So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.,Our chimpanzee,,first we found two of themnin the state of New York.,Both of them would die beforenwe could even get our suits filed.,Then we found Tommy.,Tommy is a chimpanzee.nYou see him behind me.,Tommy was a chimpanzee.nWe found him in that cage.,We found him in a small roomnthat was filled with cages,in a larger warehouse structure on a usedntrailer lot in central New York.,We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.,Kiko was in the back of a cementnstorefront in western Massachusetts.,And we found Hercules and Leo.,They're two young male chimpanzees,who are being used for biomedical,nanatomical research at Stony Brook.,We found them. 
 And so on the last week of December 2013,,the Nonhuman Rights Project filed threensuits all across the state of New York,using the same common lawnwrit of habeus corpus argument,that had been used with James Somerset,,and we demanded that the judges issuenthese common law writs of habeus corpus.,We wanted the chimpanzees out,,and we wanted them broughtnto Save the Chimps,,a tremendous chimpanzeensanctuary in South Florida,which involves an artificial lakenwith 12 or 13 islands --,there are two or three acresnwhere two dozen chimpanzees live,on each of them.,And these chimpanzees would then liventhe life of a chimpanzee,,with other chimpanzees in an environmentnthat was as close to Africa as possible. 
 Now, all these cases are still going on.,We have not yet run intonour Lord Mansfield.,We shall. We shall.,This is a long-term strategicnlitigation campaign. We shall.,And to quote Winston Churchill,,the way we view our casesnis that they're not the end,,they're not even the beginning of the end,,but they are perhapsnthe end of the beginning. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the great 1980s movie n"The Blues Brothers,",there's a scene where John Belushingoes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment,in Chicago for the very first time.,It's a cramped, tiny space,and it's just three feet awaynfrom the train tracks.,As John sits on Dan's bed,,a train goes rushing by,,rattling everything in the room.,John asks, "How often doesnthat train go by?",Dan replies, "So often, you won'tneven notice it.",And then, something falls off the wall. 
 We all know what he's talking about.,As human beings, we get usednto everyday things,really fast.,As a product designer,nit's my job to see those everyday things,,to feel them, and trynto improve upon them.,For example, see this piece of fruit?,See this little sticker?,That sticker wasn't therenwhen I was a kid.,But somewhere as the years passed,,someone had the bright ideanto put that sticker on the fruit.,Why?,So it could be easier for us,to check out nat the grocery counter. 
 Well that's great,,we can get in and out ofnthe store quickly.,But now, there's a new problem.,When we get home and we're hungry,and we see this ripe, juicy piecenof fruit on the counter,,we just want to pick it upnand eat it.,Except now, we have to looknfor this little sticker.,And dig at it with our nails,ndamaging the flesh.,Then rolling up that sticker --,you know what I mean.,And then trying to flicknit off your fingers.,(Applause),It's not fun,,not at all. 
 But something interesting happened.,See the first time you did it,nyou probably felt those feelings.,You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.,You felt upset.,You just wanted to dive in.,By the 10th time,,you started to become less upset,and you just started peelingnthe label off.,By the 100th time,nat least for me,,I became numb to it.,I simply picked up the piece of fruit,,dug at it with my nails,ntried to flick it off,,and then wondered,,"Was there another sticker?" 
 So why is that?,Why do we get used to everyday things?,Well as human beings,nwe have limited brain power.,And so our brains encode the neveryday things we do into habits,so we can free up space nto learn new things.,It's a process called habituation,and it's one of the most basic ways,nas humans, we learn. 
 Now, habituation isn't always bad.,Remember learning to drive?,I sure do.,Your hands clenched at 10 and 2non the wheel,,looking at every singlenobject out there --,the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.,It's a nerve-wracking experience.,So much so, that I couldn't evenntalk to anyone else in the car,and I couldn't even listen to music.,But then something interesting happened.,As the weeks went by,ndriving became easier and easier.,You habituated it.,It started to become nfun and second nature.,And then, you could talk nto your friends again,and listen to music. 
 So there's a good reason whynour brains habituate things.,If we didn't, we'd noticenevery little detail,,all the time.,It would be exhausting,,and we'd have no timento learn about new things. 
 But sometimes,nhabituation isn't good.,If it stops us from noticing nthe problems that are around us,,well, that's bad.,And if it stops us from noticing nand fixing those problems,,well, then that's really bad. 
 Comedians know all about this.,Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was builtnon noticing those little details,,those idiotic things we do every daynthat we don't even remember.,He tells us about the time nhe visited his friends,and he just wanted to take na comfortable shower.,He'd reach out and grab the handlenand turn it slightly one way,,and it was 100 degrees too hot.,And then he'd turn it the other way,nand it was 100 degrees too cold.,He just wanted a comfortable shower.,Now, we've all been there,,we just don't remember it.,But Jerry did,,and that's a comedian's job. 
 But designers, innovators nand entrepreneurs,,it's our job to not just noticenthose things,,but to go one step furthernand try to fix them. 
 See this, this person,,this is Mary Anderson.,In 1902 in New York City,,she was visiting.,It was a cold, wet, snowy daynand she was warm inside a streetcar.,As she was going to her destination,nshe noticed the driver opening the window,to clean off the excess snownso he could drive safely.,When he opened the window, though,nhe let all this cold, wet air inside,,making all the passengers miserable.,Now probably, most of those npassengers just thought,,"It's a fact of life, he's gotnto open the window to clean it.,That's just how it is.",But Mary didn't.,Mary thought,,"What if the diver could actually cleannthe windshield from the inside,so that he could stay safe and drive,and the passengers could nactually stay warm?",So she picked up her sketchbooknright then and there,,and began drawing what would becomenthe world's first windshield wiper. 
 Now as a product designer,nI try to learn from people like Mary,to try to see the world nthe way it really is,,not the way we think it is.,Why?,Because it's easy to solve a problemnthat almost everyone sees.,But it's hard to solve a problemnthat almost no one sees. 
 Now some people thinknyou're born with this ability,or you're not,,as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birthnto see the world more clearly.,That wasn't the case for me.,I had to work at it.,During my years at Apple,,Steve Jobs challenged usnto come into work every day,,to see our products through nthe eyes of the customer,,the new customer,,the one that has fears nand possible frustrations,and hopeful exhilaration that theirnnew technology product,could work straightaway for them.,He called it staying beginners,,and wanted to make sure that wenfocused on those tiny little details,to make them faster, easier and seamlessnfor the new customers. 
 So I remember this clearlynin the very earliest days of the iPod.,See, back in the '90s,,being a gadget freak like I am,,I would rush out to the storenfor the very, very latest gadget.,I'd take all the time to get to the store,,I'd check out, I'd come back home,nI'd start to unbox it.,And then, there was nanother little sticker:,the one that said, "Charge before use." 
 What!,I can't believe it!,I just spent all this timenbuying this product,and now I have to charge before use.,I have to wait what felt like an eternitynto use that coveted new toy.,It was crazy. 
 But you know what?,Almost every product back then did that.,When it had batteries in it,,you had to charge itnbefore you used it.,Well, Steve noticed that,and he said,,"We're not going to let that nhappen to our product.",So what did we do?,Typically, when you have a productnthat has a hard drive in it,,you run it for about n30 minutes in the factory,to make sure that hard drive's going nto be working years later,for the customer after they npull it out of the box.,What did we do instead?,We ran that product for over two hours.,Why?,Well, first off, we could makena higher quality product,,be easy to test,,and make sure it was greatnfor the customer.,But most importantly,,the battery came fully chargednright out of the box,,ready to use.,So that customer, nwith all that exhilaration,,could just start using the product.,It was great, and it worked.,People liked it. 
 Today, almost every productnthat you get that's battery powered,comes out of the box fully charged,,even if it doesn't have a hard drive.,But back then, we noticed nthat detail and we fixed it,,and now everyone else does that as well.,No more, "Charge before use." 
 So why am I telling you this?,Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,,not just the obvious problem,nthat's important,,not just for product design,nbut for everything we do.,You see, there are invisible problemsnall around us,,ones we can solve.,But first we neednto see them, to feel them. 
 So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips,about neuroscience or psychology.,There's far too many experienced peoplenin the TED community,who would know much morenabout that than I ever will.,But let me leave you withna few tips that I do,,that we all can do,nto fight habituation. 
 My first tip is to look broader.,You see, when you're tackling a problem,,sometimes, there are a lot of stepsnthat lead up to that problem.,And sometimes, a lot nof steps after it.,If you can take a step backnand look broader,,maybe you can change some of those boxes,before the problem.,Maybe you can combine them.,Maybe you can remove them altogethernto make that better. 
 Take thermostats, for instance.,In the 1900s when they first came out,nthey were really simple to use.,You could turn them up or turn them down.,People understood them.,But in the 1970s,,the energy crisis struck,,and customers started thinking aboutnhow to save energy.,So what happened?,Thermostat designers decided nto add a new step.,Instead of just turning up and down,,you now had to program it.,So you could tell it the temperaturenyou wanted at a certain time.,Now that seemed great.,Every thermostat hadnstarted adding that feature.,But it turned out that no onensaved any energy.,Now, why is that?,Well, people couldn't predict the future.,They just didn't know how their weeksnwould change season to season,,year to year.,So no one was saving energy,,and what happened? 
 Thermostat designers went backnto the drawing board,and they focused on that programming step.,They made better U.I.s,,they made better documentation.,But still, years later,npeople were not saving any energy,because they just couldn'tnpredict the future.,So what did we do?,We put a machine-learning algorithm inninstead of the programming,that would simply watchnwhen you turned it up and down,,when you liked a certain temperaturenwhen you got up,,or when you went away.,And you know what?,It worked.,People are saving energy nwithout any programming. 
 So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.,If you take a step back nand look at all the boxes,,maybe there's a waynto remove one or combine them,so that you can make nthat process much simpler.,So that's my first tip: look broader. 
 For my second tip, it's to look closer.,One of my greatest teachers nwas my grandfather.,He taught me all about the world.,He taught me how things were builtnand how they were repaired,,the tools and techniques necessarynto make a successful project.,I remember one story nhe told me about screws,,and about how you need to haventhe right screw for the right job.,There are many different screws:,wood screws, metal screws,nanchors, concrete screws,,the list went on and on.,Our job is to make productsnthat are easy to install,for all of our customs themselvesnwithout professionals.,So what did we do?,I remembered that story nthat my grandfather told me,,and so we thought,,"How many different screws ncan we put in the box?,Was it going to be two, three,nfour, five?,Because there's so manyndifferent wall types.",So we thought about it, we optimized it,,and we came up with three differentnscrews to put in the box.,We thought that was goingnto solve the problem.,But it turned out, it didn't. 
 So we shipped the product,,and people weren't havingna great experience.,So what did we do?,We went back to the drawing board,just instantly after we figured outnwe didn't get it right.,And we designed a special screw,na custom screw,,much to the chagrin of our investors.,They were like, "Why are you spendingnso much time on a little screw?,Get out there and sell more!",And we said, "We will sell morenif we get this right.",And it turned out, we did.,With that custom little screw,nthere was just one screw in the box,,that was easy to mountnand put on the wall. 
 So if we focus on those tiny details,nthe ones we may not see,and we look at them as we say,,"Are those important,or is that the way we've always done it?,Maybe there's a way to get rid of those." 
 So my last piece of advicenis to think younger.,Every day, I'm confronted with interestingnquestions from my three young kids.,They come up with questions like,,"Why can't cars fly around traffic?",Or, "Why don't my shoelacesnhave Velcro instead?",Sometimes, those questions are smart.,My son came to me the other daynand I asked him,,"Go run out to the mailbox nand check it.",He looked at me, puzzled, and said,,"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itselfnand tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter),I was like, "That's a pretty ngood question.",So, they can ask tons of questions,and sometimes we find outnwe just don't have the right answers.,We say, "Son, that's just the waynthe world works.",So the more we're exposed to something,,the more we get used to it.,But kids haven't been around nlong enough,to get used to those things.,And so when they run into problems,,they immediately try to solve them,,and sometimes they find a better way,,and that way really is better. 
 So my advice that we take to heartnis to have young people on your team,,or people with young minds.,Because if you have those young minds,,they cause everyone in the roomnto think younger.,Picasso once said, n"Every child is an artist.,The problem is when he or she grows up,nis how to remain an artist.",We all saw the world more clearlynwhen we saw it for the first time,,before a lifetime of habits ngot in the way.,Our challenge is to get back there,,to feel that frustration,,to see those little details,,to look broader,,look closer,,and to think younger,so we can stay beginners. 
 It's not easy.,It requires us pushing back,against one of the most basic waysnwe make sense of the world.,But if we do,,we could do some pretty amazing things.,For me, hopefully, that's betternproduct design.,For you, that could mean something else,nsomething powerful. 
 Our challenge is to wake up neach day and say,,"How can I experience the world better?",And if we do, maybe, just maybe,,we can get rid of thesendumb little stickers. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It was April 8, 2003.,I was in Baghdad,ncovering the war in Iraq.,That day, Americans tanksnstarted arriving in Baghdad.,We were just a few journalistsnin the Palestine Hotel,,and, as happens in war,,the fighting began to approachnoutside our windows.,Baghdad was coverednin black smoke and oil.,It smelled awful.,We couldn't see a thing,nbut we knew what was happening. 
 Of course, I was supposednto be writing an article,,but that's how it always goes --,you're supposed to be writingnand something big happens.,So I was in my room on the 16th floor,,writing and looking out the windownevery now and then,to see what was happening.,Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.,During the previous three weeks,,there had been shellingnwith half-ton missiles,,but this time, the shock --,I felt it inside of me,,and I thought, "It's very close.,It's very, very close." 
 So I went down to see what was happening.,I went down to the 15th floor,to take a look.,And I saw people, journalists,nscreaming in the hallways.,I walked into a room,and realized that it hadnbeen hit by a missile.,Someone had been wounded.,There was a man near the window,,a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,,lying face-down.,Having worked in a hospital before,nI wanted to help out.,So I turned him over.,And when I turned him over,,I noticed that he was opennfrom sternum to pubis,,but I couldn't see anything,nnothing at all.,All I saw was a white, pearly,nshiny spot that blinded me,,and I didn't understand what was going on. 
 Once the spot disappearednand I could see his wound,,which was very serious,,my buddies and I put a sheetnunderneath him,,and we carried him onto an elevatornthat stopped at each of the 15 floors.,We put him in a carnthat took him to the hospital.,He died on the way to the hospital.,The Spanish cameraman José Couso,nwho was on the 14th floor and also hit --,because the shell had explodednbetween the two floors --,died on the operating table.,As soon as the car left, I went back.,There was that articlenI was supposed to write --,which I had to write. 
 And so --,I returned to the hotel lobbynwith my arms covered in blood,,when one of the hotel gofers stopped me,and asked me to pay the taxnI hadn't paid for 10 days.,I told him to get lost.,And I said to myself:n"Clear your head, put it all aside.,If you want to write,nyou need to put it all aside.",And that's what I did.,I went upstairs, wrotenmy article and sent it off. 
 Later, aside from the feelingnof having lost my colleagues,,something else was bothering me.,I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,,and I couldn't understand what it meant.,And then, the war was over. 
 Later, I thought: "That's not possible.nI can't just not know what happened.",Because it wasn't the first time,nand it didn't only happen to me.,I have seen things like thatnhappen to others,in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.,I have seen thingsnthat had an effect on me too.,For example, there was this mannI knew in Lebanon,,a 25-year-old veterannwho had been fighting for five years --,a real veteran -- who we wouldnfollow everywhere.,He would crawl in the darknwith confidence --,he was a great soldier, a true soldier --,so we would follow him,nknowing that we would be safe with him.,And one day, as I was told --,and I've seen him again since --,he was back in the camp, playing cards,,when someone came in next door,,and discharged their weapon.,As the gun went off,,that blast, that one shot,nmade him duck quickly under the table,,like a child.,He was shaking, panicking.,And since then, he has nevernbeen able to get up and fight.,He ended up working as a croupier,in a Beirut casinonwhere I later found him,,because he couldn't sleep,nso it was quite a suitable job. 
 So I thought to myself,,"What is this thing that can kill you,without leavingnany visible scars?,How does that happen?,What is this unknown thing?",It was too common to be coincidental. 
 So I started to investigate --,that's all I know how to do.,I started to investigate,by looking through books,,reaching out to psychiatrists,,going to museums, libraries, etc.,Finally, I discoverednthat some people knew about this --,often military psychiatrists --,and that what we were dealing withnwas called trauma.,Americans call it PTSDnor traumatic neurosis.,It was something,that existed,,but that we never spoke about. 
 So, this trauma --,what is it?,Well, it's an encounter with death.,I don't know if you've ever hadnan experience with death --,I'm not talking about dead bodies,,or someone's grandfathernlying in a hospital bed,,or someone who got hit by a car.,I'm talking about facingnthe void of death.,And that is somethingnno one is supposed to see.,People used to say,,"Neither the sun, nor deathncan be looked at with a steady eye.",A human being should notnhave to face the void of death. 
 But when that happens,,it can remain invisible for a while --,days, weeks, months, sometimes years.,And then, at some point,,it explodes,,because it's somethingnthat has entered your brain --,a sort of window between an imagenand your mind --,that has penetrated your brain,,staying there and taking upnall the space inside.,And there are people --nmen, women,,who suddenly no longer sleep.,And they experiencenhorrible anxiety attacks --,panic attacks, not just minor fears.,They suddenly don't want to sleep,,because when they do, they haventhe same nightmare every night.,They see the same image every night.,What type of image?,For example, a soldiernwho enters a building,and comes face to facenwith another soldier aiming at him.,He looks at the gun,nstraight down the barrel.,And this barrel suddenlynbecomes enormous, deformed.,It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.,And he says --,later he will say, "I saw death.,I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead.",And from then on, he knows he is dead.,It is not a perception --nhe is convinced that he is dead.,In reality, someone came in,nthe guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,,and he didn't actually get shot --,but to him, he died in that moment.,Or it can be the smellnof a mass grave --,I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.,It can be the voice of a friend calling,,and they're being slaughterednand there's nothing you can do.,You hear that voice,,and you wake up every night --nfor weeks, months --,in a trance-like state,nanxious and terrified,,like a child.,I have seen men cry --,just like children --,from seeing the same image. 
 So having that imagenof horror in your brain,,seeing the void of death --,that analogue of horrornwhich is hiding something --,will completely take over.,You cannot do anything, anything at all.,You cannot work anymore,,you cannot love anymore.,You go home and don't recognize anyone.,You don't even recognize yourself.,You hide and don't leave the house,nyou lock yourself in, you become ill.,I know people who placed small cansnoutside their house with coins inside,,in case someone tried to get in.,All of a sudden, you feelnlike you want to die or kill,or hide or run away.,You want to be loved,nbut you hate everyone.,It's a feeling that seizes you entirely,day in and day out,,and you suffer tremendously.,And no one understands.,They say, "There's nothing wrong with you.nYou seem fine, you have no injuries.,You went to war, came back; you're fine.",These people suffer tremendously.,Some commit suicide.,After all, suicide is like updatingnyour daily planner --,I'm already dead,nI might as well commit suicide.,Plus, there is no more pain.,Some commit suicide,nothers end up under the bridge, drinking.,Everyone remembersnthat grandfather or uncle or neighbor,who used to drink, never said a word,,always in a bad mood, beat his wife,and who would end up either sinkingninto alcoholism or dying. 
 And why do we not talk about this?,We don't talk about it because it's taboo.,It's not like we don't have the wordsnto express the void of death.,But others don't want hear it.,The first time I returnednfrom an assignment,,They said, "Oh! He's back.",There was a fancy dinner --nwhite tablecloth, candles, guests.,"Tell us everything!",Which I did.,After 20 minutes, peoplenwere giving me dirty looks,,the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.,It was horrible and I realizednI ruined the whole evening.,So I don't talk about it anymore.,We're just not ready to listen.,People say outright: "Please, stop." 
 Is that a rare occurrence?,No, it's extremely common.,One third of the soldiersnwho died in Iraq --,well, not "died," let me re-phrase that --,one third of the US soldiersnwho went to Iraq,suffer from PTSD.,In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiersnfrom the First World War,that were being treatednin British psychiatric hospitals.,In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --,Americans.,In 1987, the US governmentnidentified 102,000 --,twice as many --,102,000 veterans who diednfrom committing suicide.,Twice as many deaths by suicidenthan by combat in Vietnam.,So you see, this relates to everything,,not just modern warfare,nbut also ancient wars --,you can read about it,nthe evidence is there.,So why do we not talk about it?,Why have we not talked about it?,The problem is thatnif you don't talk about it,,you're heading for disaster. 
 The only way to heal --,and the good news herenis that this is treatable --,think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --,it's indeed treatable.,The only way to heal from this trauma,,from this encounter with deathnthat overwhelms, petrifies and kills you,is to find a way to express it. 
 People used to say,,"Language is the only thingnthat holds all of us together.",Without language, we're nothing.,It's the thing that makes us human.,In the face of such a horrible image --,a wordless image of oblivionnthat obsesses us --,the only way to cope with it,is to put human words to it.,Because these peoplenfeel excluded from humanity.,No one wants to see them anymorenand they don't want to see anyone.,They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.,Someone said, "Doctor,nI don't use the subway anymore,because I'm afraid peoplenwill see the horror in my eyes.",Another guy thought he hadna terrible skin disease,and spent six months with dermatologists,ngoing from doctor to doctor.,And then one day, they sent himnto a psychiatrist.,During his second session,nhe told the psychiatrist,he had a terrible skin diseasenfrom head to toe.,The psychiatrist asked,n"Why are you in this state?",And the man said, "Well, becausenI'm dead, so I must be rotting away." 
 So you see this is somethingnthat has a profound effect on people.,In order to heal,nwe need to talk about it.,The horror needs to be put into words --,human words, so we can organize itnand talk about it again.,We have to look death in the face.,And if we can do that,nif we can talk about these things,,then step by step,nby working it out verbally,,we can reclaim our place in humanity.,And it is important.,Silence kills us. 
 So what does this mean?,It means that after a trauma,,without question, we losenour "unbearable lightness of being,",that sense of immortalitynthat keeps us here --,meaning, if we're here, we almost feelnlike we're immortal, which we're not,,but if we didn't believe that,nwe'd say, "What's the point of it all?",But trauma survivors have lostnthat feeling of immortality.,They've lost their lightness.,But they have found something else.,So this means that if we managento look death in the face,,and actually confront it,nrather than keep quiet and hide,,like some of the men or women I know did,,such as Michael from Rwanda,nCarole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo,and other people I know,,like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,,who gave up field assignmentsnafter a trauma.,Five friends of mine committed suicide,,they're the onesnwho did not survive the trauma. 
 So if we can look death in the face,,if we, mortal humans, human mortals,,understand that we are humannand mortal, mortal and human,,if we can confront deathnand identify it once again,as the most mysterious placenof all mysterious places,,since no one has ever seen it --,if we can give it back this meaning,,yes, we may die,,survive,and come back to life,,but we'll come back stronger than before.,Much stronger. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In my lab, we buildnautonomous aerial robots,like the one you see flying here.,Unlike the commercially available dronesnthat you can buy today,,this robot doesn't have any GPS on board.,So without GPS,,it's hard for robots like thisnto determine their position.,This robot uses onboard sensors,ncameras and laser scanners,,to scan the environment.,It detects features from the environment,,and it determines where it isnrelative to those features,,using a method of triangulation.,And then it can assemblenall these features into a map,,like you see behind me.,And this map then allows the robotnto understand where the obstacles are,and navigate in a collision-free manner. 
 What I want to show you next,is a set of experimentsnwe did inside our laboratory,,where this robot was ablento go for longer distances.,So here you'll see, on the top right,nwhat the robot sees with the camera.,And on the main screen --,and of course this is sped upnby a factor of four --,on the main screen you'll seenthe map that it's building.,So this is a high-resolution mapnof the corridor around our laboratory.,And in a minutenyou'll see it enter our lab,,which is recognizablenby the clutter that you see. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the main point I want to convey to you,is that these robots are capablenof building high-resolution maps,at five centimeters resolution,,allowing somebody who is outside the lab,nor outside the building,to deploy thesenwithout actually going inside,,and trying to infernwhat happens inside the building. 
 Now there's one problemnwith robots like this.,The first problem is it's pretty big.,Because it's big, it's heavy.,And these robots consumenabout 100 watts per pound.,And this makes forna very short mission life.,The second problem,is that these robots have onboard sensorsnthat end up being very expensive --,a laser scanner, a cameranand the processors.,That drives up the cost of this robot. 
 So we asked ourselves a question:,what consumer productncan you buy in an electronics store,that is inexpensive, that's lightweight,nthat has sensing onboard and computation?,And we invented the flying phone. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxynsmartphone that you can buy off the shelf,,and all you need is an app that youncan download from our app store.,And you can see this robotnreading the letters, "TED" in this case,,looking at the cornersnof the "T" and the "E",and then triangulating off of that,nflying autonomously.,That joystick is just therento make sure if the robot goes crazy,,Giuseppe can kill it. 
 (Laughter) 
 In addition to buildingnthese small robots,,we also experiment with aggressivenbehaviors, like you see here.,So this robot is now travelingnat two to three meters per second,,pitching and rolling aggressivelynas it changes direction.,The main point is we can havensmaller robots that can go faster,and then travel in thesenvery unstructured environments. 
 And in this next video,,just like you see this bird, an eagle,ngracefully coordinating its wings,,its eyes and feetnto grab prey out of the water,,our robot can go fishing, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 In this case, this is a Philly cheesesteaknhoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you can see this robotngoing at about three meters per second,,which is faster than walking speed,ncoordinating its arms, its claws,and its flight with split-second timingnto achieve this maneuver.,In another experiment,,I want to show younhow the robot adapts its flight,to control its suspended payload,,whose length is actually largernthan the width of the window.,So in order to accomplish this,,it actually has to pitchnand adjust the altitude,and swing the payload through.,But of course we wantnto make these even smaller,,and we're inspirednin particular by honeybees.,So if you look at honeybees,nand this is a slowed down video,,they're so small,nthe inertia is so lightweight -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that they don't care --nthey bounce off my hand, for example.,This is a little robotnthat mimics the honeybee behavior.,And smaller is better,,because along with the small sizenyou get lower inertia.,Along with lower inertia -- 
 (Robot buzzing, laughter) 
 along with lower inertia,nyou're resistant to collisions.,And that makes you more robust.,So just like these honeybees,nwe build small robots.,And this particular onenis only 25 grams in weight.,It consumes only six watts of power.,And it can travelnup to six meters per second.,So if I normalize that to its size,,it's like a Boeing 787 travelingnten times the speed of sound. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I want to show you an example.,This is probably the first planned mid-airncollision, at one-twentieth normal speed.,These are going at a relative speednof two meters per second,,and this illustrates the basic principle.,The two-gram carbon fiber cage around itnprevents the propellers from entangling,,but essentially the collision is absorbednand the robot responds to the collisions.,And so small also means safe.,In my lab, as we developed these robots,,we start off with these big robots,and then now we're downnto these small robots.,And if you plot a histogramnof the number of Band-Aids we've ordered,in the past, that sort of tailed off now.,Because these robots are really safe. 
 The small size has some disadvantages,,and nature has found a number of waysnto compensate for these disadvantages.,The basic idea is they aggregatento form large groups, or swarms.,So, similarly, in our lab,nwe try to create artificial robot swarms.,And this is quite challenging,because now you have to thinknabout networks of robots.,And within each robot,,you have to think about the interplaynof sensing, communication, computation --,and this network then becomesnquite difficult to control and manage.,So from nature we take awaynthree organizing principles,that essentially allow usnto develop our algorithms.,The first idea is that robotsnneed to be aware of their neighbors.,They need to be able to sensenand communicate with their neighbors. 
 So this video illustrates the basic idea.,You have four robots --,one of the robots has actually beennhijacked by a human operator, literally.,But because the robotsninteract with each other,,they sense their neighbors,,they essentially follow.,And here there's a single personnable to lead this network of followers.,So again, it's not because all the robotsnknow where they're supposed to go.,It's because they're just reactingnto the positions of their neighbors. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the next experiment illustratesnthe second organizing principle.,And this principle has to donwith the principle of anonymity.,Here the key idea is that,the robots are agnosticnto the identities of their neighbors.,They're asked to form a circular shape,,and no matter how many robotsnyou introduce into the formation,,or how many robots you pull out,,each robot is simplynreacting to its neighbor.,It's aware of the fact that it needsnto form the circular shape,,but collaborating with its neighbors,it forms the shapenwithout central coordination.,Now if you put these ideas together,,the third idea is that wenessentially give these robots,mathematical descriptionsnof the shape they need to execute.,And these shapes can be varyingnas a function of time,,and you'll see these robotsnstart from a circular formation,,change into a rectangular formation,nstretch into a straight line,,back into an ellipse.,And they do this with the samenkind of split-second coordination,that you see in natural swarms, in nature. 
 So why work with swarms?,Let me tell you about two applicationsnthat we are very interested in.,The first one has to do with agriculture,,which is probably the biggest problemnthat we're facing worldwide.,As you well know,,one in every seven personsnin this earth is malnourished.,Most of the land that we can cultivatenhas already been cultivated.,And the efficiency of most systemsnin the world is improving,,but our production systemnefficiency is actually declining.,And that's mostly because of waternshortage, crop diseases, climate change,and a couple of other things. 
 So what can robots do?,Well, we adopt an approach that'sncalled Precision Farming in the community.,And the basic idea is that we flynaerial robots through orchards,,and then we buildnprecision models of individual plants.,So just like personalized medicine,,while you might imagine wantingnto treat every patient individually,,what we'd like to do is buildnmodels of individual plants,and then tell the farmernwhat kind of inputs every plant needs --,the inputs in this case being water,nfertilizer and pesticide.,Here you'll see robotsntraveling through an apple orchard,,and in a minute you'll seentwo of its companions,doing the same thing on the left side.,And what they're doing is essentiallynbuilding a map of the orchard.,Within the map is a mapnof every plant in this orchard. 
 (Robot buzzing) 
 Let's see what those maps look like.,In the next video, you'll see the camerasnthat are being used on this robot.,On the top-left is essentiallyna standard color camera.,On the left-center is an infrared camera.,And on the bottom-leftnis a thermal camera.,And on the main panel, you're seeingna three-dimensional reconstruction,of every tree in the orchardnas the sensors fly right past the trees.,Armed with information like this,nwe can do several things.,The first and possibly the most importantnthing we can do is very simple:,count the number of fruits on every tree.,By doing this, you tell the farmernhow many fruits she has in every tree,and allow her to estimatenthe yield in the orchard,,optimizing the productionnchain downstream. 
 The second thing we can do,is take models of plants, constructnthree-dimensional reconstructions,,and from that estimate the canopy size,,and then correlate the canopy sizento the amount of leaf area on every plant.,And this is called the leaf area index.,So if you know this leaf area index,,you essentially have a measure of how muchnphotosynthesis is possible in every plant,,which again tells younhow healthy each plant is.,By combining visualnand infrared information,,we can also compute indices such as NDVI.,And in this particular case,nyou can essentially see,there are some crops that arennot doing as well as other crops.,This is easily discernible from imagery,,not just visual imagery but combining,both visual imagery and infrared imagery. 
 And then lastly,,one thing we're interested in doing isndetecting the early onset of chlorosis --,and this is an orange tree --,which is essentially seennby yellowing of leaves.,But robots flying overheadncan easily spot this autonomously,and then report to the farmernthat he or she has a problem,in this section of the orchard. 
 Systems like this can really help,,and we're projecting yieldsnthat can improve by about ten percent,and, more importantly, decreasenthe amount of inputs such as water,by 25 percent by usingnaerial robot swarms. 
 Lastly, I want you to applaudnthe people who actually create the future,,Yash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liunand Giuseppe Loianno,,who are responsible for the threendemonstrations that you saw. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Raise your hand if you've evernbeen asked the question,"What do you want to be when you grow up?" 
 Now if you had to guess,,how old would you say you werenwhen you were first asked this question?,You can just hold up fingers.,Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.,Now, raise your hand if the question,"What do you want to be when you grow up?",has ever caused you any anxiety. 
 (Laughter) 
 Any anxiety at all. 
 I'm someone who's nevernbeen able to answer the question,"What do you want to be when you grow up?" 
 See, the problem wasn'tnthat I didn't have any interests --,it's that I had too many.,In high school, I liked Englishnand math and art and I built websites,and I played guitar in a punk bandncalled Frustrated Telephone Operator.,Maybe you've heard of us. 
 (Laughter) 
 This continued after high school,,and at a certain point, I begannto notice this pattern in myself,where I would become interested in an area,and I would dive in, become all-consumed,,and I'd get to be pretty goodnat whatever it was,,and then I would hit this pointnwhere I'd start to get bored.,And usually I would trynand persist anyway,,because I had already devotednso much time and energy,and sometimes money into this field.,But eventually this sense of boredom,,this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,nthis isn't challenging anymore --,it would get to be too much.,And I would have to let it go. 
 But then I would become interestednin something else,,something totally unrelated,nand I would dive into that,,and become all-consumed,nand I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,",and then I would hit this point againnwhere I'd start to get bored.,And eventually, I would let it go.,But then I would discovernsomething new and totally different,,and I would dive into that. 
 This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,,for two reasons.,The first was that I wasn't sure,how I was going to turnnany of this into a career.,I thought that I would eventuallynhave to pick one thing,,deny all of my other passions,,and just resign myself to being bored.,The other reason it caused menso much anxiety,was a little bit more personal.,I worried that therenwas something wrong with this,,and something wrong with menfor being unable to stick with anything.,I worried that I was afraid of commitment,,or that I was scattered,nor that I was self-sabotaging,,afraid of my own success. 
 If you can relate to my storynand to these feelings,,I'd like you to ask yourself a question,that I wish I had asked myself back then.,Ask yourself where you learned to assignnthe meaning of wrong or abnormal,to doing many things.,I'll tell you where you learned it:,you learned it from the culture. 
 We are first asked the questionn"What do you want to be when you grow up?",when we're about five years old.,And the truth is that no one really caresnwhat you say when you're that age. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's considered an innocuous question,,posed to little kidsnto elicit cute replies,,like, "I want to be an astronaut,"nor "I want to be a ballerina,",or "I want to be a pirate.",Insert Halloween costume here. 
 (Laughter) 
 But this question gets asked of usnagain and again as we get older,in various forms -- for instance,nhigh school students might get asked,what major they're goingnto pick in college.,And at some point,,"What do you want to be when you grow up?",goes from beingnthe cute exercise it once was,to the thing that keeps us up at night.,Why? 
 See, while this question inspires kidsnto dream about what they could be,,it does not inspire them to dreamnabout all that they could be.,In fact, it does just the opposite,,because when someone asks younwhat you want to be,,you can't reply with 20 different things,,though well-meaning adultsnwill likely chuckle and be like,,"Oh, how cute, but you can't bena violin maker and a psychologist.,You have to choose." 
 This is Dr. Bob Childs -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.,And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editornturned illustrator, entrepreneur,,teacher and creative director.,But most kids don't hearnabout people like this.,All they hear,is that they're going to have to choose.,But it's more than that.,The notion of the narrowly focused life,is highly romanticized in our culture.,It's this idea of destinynor the one true calling,,the idea that we each have one great thing,we are meant to donduring our time on this earth,,and you need to figure outnwhat that thing is,and devote your life to it. 
 But what if you're someonenwho isn't wired this way?,What if there are a lot of differentnsubjects that you're curious about,,and many different things you want to do?,Well, there is no room for someonenlike you in this framework.,And so you might feel alone.,You might feel like you don'tnhave a purpose.,And you might feel likenthere's something wrong with you.,There's nothing wrong with you.,What you are is a multipotentialite. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 A multipotentialite is someonenwith many interests and creative pursuits.,It's a mouthful to say.,It might help if you break it upninto three parts:,multi, potential, and ite.,You can also use one of the other termsnthat connote the same idea,,such as polymath, the Renaissance person.,Actually, during the Renaissance period,,it was considered the idealnto be well-versed in multiple disciplines.,Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners.",Use whichever term you like,nor invent your own.,I have to say I find it sort of fittingnthat as a community,,we cannot agree on a single identity. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's easy to see your multipotentiality,as a limitation or an afflictionnthat you need to overcome.,But what I've learnednthrough speaking with people,and writing about thesenideas on my website,,is that there are some tremendousnstrengths to being this way.,Here are three,multipotentialite super powers. 
 One: idea synthesis.,That is, combining two or more fields,and creating something newnat the intersection.,Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drewnfrom their shared interests,in cartography, data visualization,ntravel, mathematics and design,,when they founded Meshu.,Meshu is a company that createsncustom geographically-inspired jewelry.,Sha and Rachel came upnwith this unique idea,not despite, but because of their eclecticnmix of skills and experiences.,Innovation happens at the intersections.,That's where the new ideas come from.,And multipotentialites,nwith all of their backgrounds,,are able to access a lot of thesenpoints of intersection. 
 The second multipotentialite superpower,is rapid learning.,When multipotentialitesnbecome interested in something,,we go hard.,We observe everythingnwe can get our hands on.,We're also used to being beginners,,because we've been beginnersnso many times in the past,,and this means that we're less afraidnof trying new things,and stepping out of our comfort zones.,What's more, many skillsnare transferable across disciplines,,and we bring everything we've learnednto every new area we pursue,,so we're rarely starting from scratch. 
 Nora Dunn is a full-time travelernand freelance writer.,As a child concert pianist,nshe honed an incredible ability,to develop muscle memory.,Now, she's the fastest typist she knows. 
 (Laughter) 
 Before becoming a writer,nNora was a financial planner.,She had to learnnthe finer mechanics of sales,when she was starting her practice,,and this skill now helps hernwrite compelling pitches to editors.,It is rarely a waste of timento pursue something you're drawn to,,even if you end up quitting.,You might apply that knowledgenin a different field entirely,,in a way that you couldn'tnhave anticipated. 
 The third multipotentialite superpower,is adaptability;,that is, the ability to morphninto whatever you need to be,in a given situation.,Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director,nsometimes a web designer,,sometimes a Kickstarter consultant,nsometimes a teacher,,and sometimes, apparently, James Bond. 
 (Laughter) 
 He's valuable because he does good work.,He's even more valuablenbecause he can take on various roles,,depending on his clients' needs.,Fast Company magazinenidentified adaptability,as the single most important skillnto develop in order to thrive,in the 21st century.,The economic world is changingnso quickly and unpredictably,that it is the individualsnand organizations that can pivot,in order to meet the needs of the marketnthat are really going to thrive. 
 Idea synthesis, rapid learningnand adaptability:,three skills that multipotentialitesnare very adept at,,and three skills that they might losenif pressured to narrow their focus.,As a society, we have a vested interestnin encouraging multipotentialites,to be themselves.,We have a lot of complex, multidimensionalnproblems in the world right now,,and we need creative,nout-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them. 
 Now, let's say that you are,nin your heart, a specialist.,You came out of the womb knowingnyou wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.,Don't worry -- there's nothingnwrong with you, either. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, some of the best teamsnare comprised of a specialist,and multipotentialite paired together.,The specialist can dive in deepnand implement ideas,,while the multipotentialite bringsna breadth of knowledge to the project.,It's a beautiful partnership.,But we should all be designingnlives and careers,that are aligned with how we're wired.,And sadly, multipotentialitesnare largely being encouraged,simply to be morenlike their specialist peers. 
 So with that said,,if there is one thingnyou take away from this talk,,I hope that it is this:,embrace your inner wiring,nwhatever that may be.,If you're a specialist at heart,,then by all means, specialize.,That is where you'll do your best work.,But to the multipotentialites in the room,,including those of younwho may have just realized,in the last 12 minutes that you are one -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to you I say:,embrace your many passions.,Follow your curiosityndown those rabbit holes.,Explore your intersections.,Embracing our inner wiring leadsnto a happier, more authentic life.,And perhaps more importantly --,multipotentialites, the world needs us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm Chetan Bhatt,and when I give my name,nI'm often asked, "Where are you from?",And I normally say London. 
 (Laughter) 
 But of course, I knownwhat they're really asking,,so I say something like,,"Well, my grandparents and my mumnwere born in India,,my dad and I were born in Kenya,,and I was brought up in London.,And then they've got me mapped.,"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.nI've worked with one of those." 
 (Laughter) 
 And from my name they probablynassume that I'm a Hindu.,And this sort of fixes me for them. 
 But what about the Christians,and the Muslims and the atheists,that I grew up with?,Or the socialists and the liberals,,even the occasional Tory? 
 (Laughter) 
 Indeed, all kinds of women and men --,vegetable sellers, factory workers,ncooks, car mechanics --,living in my working class area,,in some profoundly important way,,they are also a part of me,and are here with me.,Maybe that's why I find it hardnto respond to questions about identity,and about origin.,And it's not just a sort ofnteenage refusal to be labeled.,It's about our own most identities,,the ones that we put our hands up to,,the ones that we cheer for,,the ones that we fight for,,the ones that we love or hate.,And it's about how we apprehend ourselves,as well as others.,And it's about identitiesnwe just assume that we have,without thinking too much about them. 
 But our responsesnto questions of identity and origin,have substantialnsocial and political importance.,We see the wars, the rages of identityngoing on all around us.,We see violent religious,nnational and ethnic disputes.,And often the conflict is basednon old stories of identity,and belonging,and origins.,And these identities are based on myths,,typically about ancient,nprimordial origins.,And these could be about Adam and Eve,or about the supremacynof a caste or gender,or about the vitality of a supposed race,or about the past gloriesnof an empire or civilization,or about a piece of land,that some imagined deity has gifted. 
 Now, people say,that origin stories and identity mythsnmake us feel secure.,What's wrong with that?,They give us a sense of belonging.,Identity is your cultural clothing,,and it can make you feelnwarm and fuzzy inside.,But does it really?,Do we really neednidentity myths to feel safe?,Because I see religious,nnational, ethnic disputes,as adding to human misery. 
 Can I dare you,to refuse every origin myth,that claims you?,What if we rejectnevery single primordial origin myth,and develop a deeper sense of personhood,,one responsible to humanity as a whole,rather than to a particular tribe,,a radically different idea of humanity,that exposes how origin myths mystify,,disguise global power,,rapacious exploitation,,poverty, the worldwide oppressionnof women and girls,,and of course massive,naccelerating inequalities? 
 Now, origin mythsnare closely linked to tradition,,and the word traditionnpoints to something old,and permanent, almost natural,,and people assume traditionnis just history,,simply the pastncondensed into a nice story.,But let's not confusentradition with history.,The two are often in severe conflict.,Origin stories are usually recentlyncreated fictions of ancient belonging,,and they're absurd,given the complexity of humanity,and our vastly interconnected,neven if very unequal world.,And today we see claims to tradition,that claim to be ancient,changing rapidly in front of our eyes. 
 I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley,with Asian, English, Caribbean,nIrish families living in our street,,and the neo-Nazi National Frontnwas massive then,with regular marches and attacks on us,and a permanent threat,and often a frequent realitynof violence against us,on the streets, in our homes,,typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.,And I remember during a general electionna leaflet came through our letter box,with a picture of the National Frontncandidate for our area.,And the picture,was of our next-door neighbor.,He threatened to shoot me oncenwhen I played in the garden as a kid,,and many weekends, shaven-headednNational Front activists,arrived at his house,and emerged with scores of placards,screaming that they wanted usnto go back home.,But today he's one of my mum's best mates.,He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,,and at some point in hisnpolitical journey out of fascism,he embraced a broader idea of humanity. 
 There was a Hindu familynthat we got to know well --,and you have to understandnthat life in our street,was a little bit like the settingnfor an Asian soap opera.,Everyone knew everyone else's business,,even if they didn't want itnto be known by anyone at all.,You really had no choice in this matter.,But in this family,nthere was a quiet little boy,who went to the same school as I did,,and after I left school,nI didn't hear much more about him,,except that he'd gone off to India.,Now around 2000,,I remember seeing this short book.,The book was unusual,because it was writtennby a British supporter of Al Qaeda,,and in it the author callsnfor attacks in Britain.,This is in 1999,,so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraqnwas still in the future,,and he helped scoutnNew York bombing targets.,He taught others how to make a dirty bombnto use on the London Underground,,and he plotted a massive bombing campaignnin London's shopping areas.,He's a very high-risk securitynprisoner in the UK,and one of the most important Al Qaedanfigures to be arrested in Britain. 
 The author of that book,was the very same quiet little boy,who went to my school.,So a Hindu boy from Britain,became an Al Qaeda fighter,and a most-wanted international terrorist,,and he rejected what people would callnhis Hindu or Indian or British identity,,and he became someone else.,He refused to be who he was.,He recreated himself,,and this kind of journey is very common,for young men and women,who become involvednin Al Qaeda or Islamic State,or other transnational armed groups.,Al Qaeda's media spokesmannis a white American,from a Jewish and Catholicnmixed background,,and neither he nor the boy from my school,were from Muslim backgrounds.,There's no point in asking themnwhere are they from.,A more important question isnwhere they're going. 
 And I would also put it to you,that exactly the same journeynoccurs for those young men and women,who were brought upnin Muslim family backgrounds.,Most of those who join Al Qaeda,and other Salafi jihadi groupsnfrom Europe, Asia, North America,,even in many cases the Middle East,are those who have comprehensivelynrejected their backgrounds,to become, in essence, new people.,They spend an enormous amount of timenattacking their parents' backgrounds,as profane, impure, blasphemous,,the wrong type of Islam,,and their vision instead,is a fantastical viewnof cosmic apocalypse.,It's a born again vision.,Discard your past,nyour society, your family and friends,since they're all impure.,Instead, become someone else,,your true self,,your authentic self.,Now, this isn'tnabout a return to the past.,It's about using a forgery of the past,to envision an appalling futurenwhich begins today at year zero.,This is why over 80 percent of the victimsnof Al Qaeda and Islamic State,are people from Muslim backgrounds.,The first act by Salafi jihadi groupsnwhen they take over an area,is to destroy existing Muslim institutions,including mosques,nshrines, preachers, practices.,Their main purpose is to controlnand punish people internally,,to dictate the spaces that women may go,,their clothing, family relations,,beliefs, even the minute detailnof how one prays.,And you get the impression in the news,that they are after us in the West,,but they are actually mainly afternpeople from other Muslim backgrounds.,In their view, no other Muslimncan ever be pure enough,,so ordinary beliefs and practicesnthat have existed for centuries,are attacked as impure,by teenagers from Birmingham or London,who know nothing,about the historiesnthat they so joyously obliterate. 
 Now here, their claim to traditionnis at war with history,,but they're neverthelessnvery certain about their purity,and about the impurity of others.,Purity,,certainty,,the return to authentic tradition,,the quest for thesencan lead to lethal visions,of perfect societies and perfected people. 
 This is what the main Hindunfundamentalist organization in India,looks like today at its mass rally.,Maybe it reminds younof the 1930s in Italy or Germany,,and the movement's rootsnare indeed in fascism.,It was a member of the samenHindu fundamentalist movement,who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.,Hindu fundamentalists todaynview this murderer as a national hero,,and they want to put upnstatues of him throughout India.,They've been involved for decades,in large-scale mass violencenagainst minorities.,They ban books, art, films.,They attack romantic couplesnon Valentine's Day,,Christians on Christmas Day.,They don't like others talking critically,about what they seenas their ancient culture,or using its images,or caricaturing it,or drawing cartoons about it.,But the people makingnthe strongest possible claims,about ancient, timeless Hindu religion,are dressed in brown shortsnand white shirts,while claiming, oddly,,to be the original Aryan race,,just like the violent Salafi jihadis,who make their claimsnabout their primordial religion,while dressed in black military uniforms,and wearing balaclavas. 
 These people are manufacturingnpure, pristine identities of conviction,and of certainty.,Fundamentalists see religion and culturenas their sole property, a property.,But religions and cultures are processes.,They're not things. They're impermanent.nThey're messy. They're impure.,Look at any religionnand you'll see disputes and arguments,going all the way down. 
 Any criticism of religion in any form,has to therefore be,part of the expansive sense of humanity,we should aspire to.,I respect your rightnto have and to express your religion,or your culture or your opinion,,but I don't necessarilynhave to respect the content.,I might like some of it.,I might like how an old churchnlooks, for example,,but this isn't the same thing.,Similarly, I have a human right,to say somethingnthat you may find offensive,,but you do not have a human rightnnot to be offended.,In a genuine democracy,nwe're constantly offended,since people expressndifferent views all the time.,They also change their views,,so their views are impermanent.,You cannot fix someone's political views,based on their religiousnor national or cultural background. 
 Now, these points about religious purity,also apply to nationalism and to racism.,I'm always puzzled,to have pride in your nationalnor ethnic identity,,pride in the accident of birthnfrom a warm and cozy womb,,belief in your superioritynbecause of the accident of birth. 
 These people have very firm ideas,about what belongs and what doesn't belong,inside the cozy national culturesnthat they imagine.,And I'm going to caricature a bit here,nbut only a little bit.,I want you to imaginenthe supporter of some Little Englander,or British nationalist political party,,and he's sitting at home,and he's screaming about foreigners,invading his country,while watching Fox News,,an American cable channel,owned by an Australian,on his South Korean television set,which was boughtnby his Spanish credit card,which is paid off monthlynby his high-street British bank,which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.,He supports a British football teamnowned by a Russian.,His favorite brand of fish and chips,is owned by a Swedishnventure capitalist firm.,The church he sometimes goes to,has its creed decidednin meetings in Ghana.,His Union Jack underpants,were made in India. 
 (Laughter) 
 And -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 And they're laundered regularly,by a very nice Polish lady. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is no pure ethnicity,nnational culture,,and the ethical choices we have today,are far wider than being forced to choose,between racist rightnand religious right visions,,dismal visions of culture. 
 Now, culture isn't justnabout language, food, clothing and music,,but gender relations, ancient monuments,,a heritage of sacred texts.,But culture can also benwhat has been decided to be culture,by those who have a political stake,in pounding cultureninto the shape of a prison.,Big political identity claimsnare elite bids for power.,They're not answers to socialnor economic or political injustices.,They often obscure them.,And what about the large numbernof people across the globe,who can't pointnto a monument from their past,,who don't possess a sacred written text,,who can't hark back,to the past gloriesnof a civilization or empire?,Are these people less a part of humanity? 
 What about you,,now, listening to this?,What about you and your identity,,because you stitch your experiencesnand your thoughts into a continuous person,moving forward in time.,And this is what you are when you say,,"I," "am," or "me.",But this also includesnall of your hopes and dreams,,all of the you's that could have been,,and it includes all the other people,and the things that arenin the biography of who you are.,They, the others,,are also a part of you,,moving forward with you.,Your authentic self,nif such a thing exists,,is a complex, messy and uncertain self,,and that is a very good thing.,Why not value thosenimpurities and uncertainties?,Maybe clinging to pure identitiesnis a sign of immaturity,,and ethnic, nationalistnand religious traditions are bad for you.,Why not be skepticalnabout every primordial origin claim,made on your behalf?,Why not reject the identity mythsnthat call on you to belong,,that politicians and community leaders,,so-called community leaders,,place on you?,If we don't need origin storiesnand fixed identities,,we can challenge ourselvesnto think creatively,about each other and our future. 
 And here culturenalways takes care of itself.,I'm not worried about culture.,Cultures are creative, dynamic processes,,not imposed laws and boundaries. 
 This is Abu al-Walid Muhammadnibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,,a very senior Muslim judge and thinkernin Cordoba in the 12th century,,and his writings were consideredndeeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.,Long after he died,,followers of his worknwere ruthlessly hunted down,,banished and killed over several centuries,by the most powerful religious institutionnof the medieval period.,That institution wasnthe Roman Catholic Church.,Why?,Because ibn Rushd saidnthat something true in religion,may conflict with something,that your reasonnfinds to be true on earth,,but the latter is still true.,There are two distinct worlds of truth,,one based on our reason and evidence,nand one that is divine,,and the state, political power, social lawnare in the realm of reason.,Religious life is a different realm.,They should be kept separated.,Social and political lifenshould be governed by our reason,,not by religion.,And you can see why the churchnwas upset by his writings,,as indeed were some Muslimsnduring his lifetime,,because he gives usna strong statement of secularism,of a kind which is normal in Europe today. 
 Now, history plays many tricks on us.,It undermines our fixed truths,and what we believento be our culture and their culture.,Ibn Rushd, someonenwho happens to be a Muslim,,is considered one of the key influences,in the introduction and spreadnof secularism in Europe. 
 So against religious, nationalistnand racial purists of all kinds,,can you make his story a part of your own,,not because he happened to be a Muslim,,not because he happened to be an Arab,,but because he was a human being,with some very good ideas,that shook his world,and ours. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)All right, I want to see a show of hands:,how many of you havenunfriended someone on Facebook,because they said something offensivenabout politics or religion,,childcare, food? 
 (Laughter) 
 And how many of younknow at least one person that you avoid,because you just don't wantnto talk to them? 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, it used to be that in ordernto have a polite conversation,,we just had to follow the advicenof Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":,Stick to the weather and your health.,But these days, with climate changenand anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- 
 (Laughter) 
 are not safe either.,So this world that we live in,,this world in which every conversation,has the potentialnto devolve into an argument,,where our politiciansncan't speak to one another,and where even the most trivial of issues,have someone fighting both passionatelynfor it and against it, it's not normal.,Pew Research did a studynof 10,000 American adults,,and they found that at this moment,nwe are more polarized,,we are more divided,,than we ever have been in history.,We're less likely to compromise,,which means we'rennot listening to each other.,And we make decisions about where to live,,who to marry and evennwho our friends are going to be,,based on what we already believe.,Again, that meansnwe're not listening to each other.,A conversation requires a balancenbetween talking and listening,,and somewhere along the way,nwe lost that balance. 
 Now, part of that is due to technology.,The smartphones that you allneither have in your hands,or close enough that you couldngrab them really quickly.,According to Pew Research,,about a third of American teenagersnsend more than a hundred texts a day.,And many of them, almost most of them,nare more likely to text their friends,than they are to talknto them face to face.,There's this great piece in The Atlantic.,It was written by a high school teachernnamed Paul Barnwell.,And he gave his kidsna communication project.,He wanted to teach them how to speaknon a specific subject without using notes.,And he said this: "I came to realize..." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I came to realizenthat conversational competence,might be the singlenmost overlooked skill we fail to teach.,Kids spend hours each day engagingnwith ideas and each other through screens,,but rarely do they have an opportunity,to hone their interpersonalncommunications skills.,It might sound like a funny question,nbut we have to ask ourselves:,Is there any 21st-century skill,more important than being able to sustainncoherent, confident conversation?" 
 Now, I make my living talking to people:,Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,,billionaires, kindergarten teachers,,heads of state, plumbers.,I talk to people that I like.nI talk to people that I don't like.,I talk to some people that I disagree withndeeply on a personal level.,But I still havena great conversation with them.,So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutesnor so teaching you how to talk,and how to listen. 
 Many of you have already heardna lot of advice on this,,things like look the person in the eye,,think of interesting topicsnto discuss in advance,,look, nod and smile to shownthat you're paying attention,,repeat back what you just heardnor summarize it.,So I want you to forget all of that.,It is crap. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is no reason to learnnhow to show you're paying attention,if you are in fact paying attention. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I actually use the exactnsame skills as a professional interviewer,that I do in regular life.,So, I'm going to teach younhow to interview people,,and that's actually going to help younlearn how to be better conversationalists.,Learn to have a conversation,without wasting your time,nwithout getting bored,,and, please God,nwithout offending anybody. 
 We've all had really great conversations.,We've had them before.nWe know what it's like.,The kind of conversation where younwalk away feeling engaged and inspired,,or where you feelnlike you've made a real connection,or you've been perfectly understood.,There is no reason,why most of your interactionsncan't be like that. 
 So I have 10 basic rules.nI'm going to walk you through all of them,,but honestly, if you just choosenone of them and master it,,you'll already enjoy better conversations. 
 Number one: Don't multitask.,And I don't meannjust set down your cell phone,or your tablet or your car keysnor whatever is in your hand.,I mean, be present.,Be in that moment.,Don't think about your argumentnyou had with your boss.,Don't think about whatnyou're going to have for dinner.,If you want to get outnof the conversation,,get out of the conversation,,but don't be half in itnand half out of it. 
 Number two: Don't pontificate.,If you want to state your opinion,without any opportunity for responsenor argument or pushback or growth,,write a blog. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, there's a really good reasonnwhy I don't allow pundits on my show:,Because they're really boring.,If they're conservative, they're going tonhate Obama and food stamps and abortion.,If they're liberal, they're going to hate,big banks and oil corporationsnand Dick Cheney.,Totally predictable.,And you don't want to be like that.,You need to enter every conversationnassuming that you have something to learn.,The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said,that true listening requiresna setting aside of oneself.,And sometimes that meansnsetting aside your personal opinion.,He said that sensing this acceptance,,the speaker will becomenless and less vulnerable,and more and more likelynto open up the inner recesses,of his or her mind to the listener.,Again, assume that you havensomething to learn. 
 Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meetnknows something that you don't.",I put it this way:,Everybody is an expert in something. 
 Number three: Use open-ended questions.,In this case, take a cue from journalists.,Start your questions with who,nwhat, when, where, why or how.,If you put in a complicated question,nyou're going to get a simple answer out.,If I ask you, "Were you terrified?",you're going to respond to the mostnpowerful word in that sentence,,which is "terrified," and the answer isn"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't.","Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry.",Let them describe it.nThey're the ones that know.,Try asking them things like,n"What was that like?","How did that feel?",Because then they might have to stopnfor a moment and think about it,,and you're going to getna much more interesting response. 
 Number four: Go with the flow.,That means thoughtsnwill come into your mind,and you need to let themngo out of your mind.,We've heard interviews often,in which a guest is talkingnfor several minutes,and then the host comes back innand asks a question,which seems like it comes out of nowhere,nor it's already been answered.,That means the host probablynstopped listening two minutes ago,because he thoughtnof this really clever question,,and he was just boundnand determined to say that.,And we do the exact same thing.,We're sitting there havingna conversation with someone,,and then we remember that timenthat we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we stop listening.,Stories and ideasnare going to come to you.,You need to let them come and let them go. 
 Number five: If you don't know,nsay that you don't know.,Now, people on the radio,nespecially on NPR,,are much more awarenthat they're going on the record,,and so they're more carefulnabout what they claim to be an expert in,and what they claim to know for sure.,Do that. Err on the side of caution.,Talk should not be cheap. 
 Number six: Don't equatenyour experience with theirs.,If they're talkingnabout having lost a family member,,don't start talking about the timenyou lost a family member.,If they're talking about the troublenthey're having at work,,don't tell them aboutnhow much you hate your job.,It's not the same. It is never the same.,All experiences are individual.,And, more importantly,nit is not about you.,You don't need to take that momentnto prove how amazing you are,or how much you've suffered.,Somebody asked Stephen Hawking oncenwhat his IQ was, and he said,,"I have no idea. People who bragnabout their IQs are losers." 
 (Laughter) 
 Conversations are notna promotional opportunity. 
 Number seven:,Try not to repeat yourself.,It's condescending,nand it's really boring,,and we tend to do it a lot.,Especially in work conversationsnor in conversations with our kids,,we have a point to make,,so we just keep rephrasing itnover and over.,Don't do that. 
 Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.,Frankly, people don't care,about the years, the names,,the dates, all those details,that you're strugglingnto come up with in your mind.,They don't care.nWhat they care about is you.,They care about what you're like,,what you have in common.,So forget the details. Leave them out. 
 Number nine:,This is not the last one,nbut it is the most important one.,Listen.,I cannot tell you how manynreally important people have said,that listening is perhaps the most,nthe number one most important skill,that you could develop.,Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,,"If your mouth is open,nyou're not learning.",And Calvin Coolidge said, "No mannever listened his way out of a job." 
 (Laughter) 
 Why do we not listen to each other?,Number one, we'd rather talk.,When I'm talking, I'm in control.,I don't have to hear anythingnI'm not interested in.,I'm the center of attention.,I can bolster my own identity.,But there's another reason:,We get distracted.,The average person talksnat about 225 word per minute,,but we can listen at up ton500 words per minute.,So our minds are filling innthose other 275 words.,And look, I know,nit takes effort and energy,to actually pay attention to someone,,but if you can't do that,nyou're not in a conversation.,You're just two people shouting outnbarely related sentences,in the same place. 
 (Laughter) 
 You have to listen to one another.,Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.,He said, "Most of us don't listennwith the intent to understand.,We listen with the intent to reply." 
 One more rule, number 10,nand it's this one: Be brief. 
 [A good conversation is like a miniskirt;nshort enough to retain interest,,but long enough to covernthe subject. -- My Sister] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause),All of this boils down to the samenbasic concept, and it is this one:,Be interested in other people. 
 You know, I grew upnwith a very famous grandfather,,and there was kind of a ritual in my home.,People would come overnto talk to my grandparents,,and after they would leave,nmy mother would come over to us,,and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?,She was the runner-up to Miss America.,He was the mayor of Sacramento.,She won a Pulitzer Prize.nHe's a Russian ballet dancer.",And I kind of grew up assuming,everyone has some hidden,namazing thing about them.,And honestly, I thinknit's what makes me a better host.,I keep my mouth shutnas often as I possibly can,,I keep my mind open,,and I'm always prepared to be amazed,,and I'm never disappointed. 
 You do the same thing.,Go out, talk to people,,listen to people,,and, most importantly,nbe prepared to be amazed. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)When I was six years old,,I received my gifts.,My first grade teachernhad this brilliant idea.,She wanted us to experiencenreceiving gifts,but also learning the virtuenof complimenting each other.,So she had all of usncome to the front of the classroom,,and she bought all of us giftsnand stacked them in the corner.,And she said,,"Why don't we just stand herenand compliment each other?,If you hear your name called,,go and pick up your gift and sit down.",What a wonderful idea, right?,What could go wrong? 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, there were 40 of us to start with,,and every time I heardnsomeone's name called,,I would give out the heartiest cheer.,And then there were 20 people left,,and 10 people left,,and five left ...,and three left.,And I was one of them.,And the compliments stopped.,Well, at that moment, I was crying.,And the teacher was freaking out.,She was like, "Hey, would anyonensay anything nice about these people?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "No one? OK, why don't youngo get your gift and sit down.,So behave next year --,someone might saynsomething nice about you." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, as I'm describing this you,,you probably knownI remember this really well. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I don't know who felt worse that day.,Was it me or the teacher?,She must have realizednthat she turned a team-building event,into a public roastnfor three six-year-olds.,And without the humor.,You know, when you seenpeople get roasted on TV,,it was funny.,There was nothing funny about that day. 
 So that was one version of me,,and I would die to avoidnbeing in that situation again --,to get rejected in public again.,That's one version.,Then fast-forward eight years.,Bill Gates came to my hometown --,Beijing, China --,to speak,,and I saw his message.,I fell in love with that guy.,I thought, wow,nI know what I want to do now.,That night I wrote a letter to my family,telling them: "By age 25,,I will build the biggestncompany in the world,,and that company will buy Microsoft." 
 (Laughter) 
 I totally embraced this ideanof conquering the world --,domination, right?,And I didn't make this up,nI did write that letter.,And here it is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 You don't have to read this through -- 
 (Laughter) 
 This is also bad handwriting,nbut I did highlight some key words.,You get the idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 So ...,that was another version of me:,one who will conquer the world. 
 Well, then two years later,,I was presented with the opportunitynto come to the United States.,I jumped on it,,because that wasnwhere Bill Gates lived, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought that was the startnof my entrepreneur journey.,Then, fast-forward another 14 years.,I was 30.,Nope, I didn't build that company.,I didn't even start.,I was actually a marketing managernfor a Fortune 500 company.,And I felt I was stuck;,I was stagnant.,Why is that?,Where is that 14-year-oldnwho wrote that letter?,It's not because he didn't try.,It's because every time I had a new idea,,every time I wanted to try something new,,even at work --,I wanted to make a proposal,,I wanted to speak upnin front of people in a group --,I felt there was this constant battle,between the 14-year-oldnand the six-year-old.,One wanted to conquer the world --,make a difference --,another was afraid of rejection.,And every time that six-year-old won. 
 And this fear even persistednafter I started my own company.,I mean, I startednmy own company when I was 30 --,if you want to be Bill Gates,,you've got to startnsooner or later, right?,When I was an entrepreneur,,I was presentednwith an investment opportunity,,and then I was turned down.,And that rejection hurt me.,It hurt me so badnthat I wanted to quit right there.,But then I thought,,hey, would Bill Gates quitnafter a simple investment rejection?,Would any successfulnentrepreneur quit like that?,No way.,And this is where it clicked for me.,OK, I can build a better company.,I can build a betternteam or better product,,but one thing for sure:,I've got to be a better leader.,I've got to be a better person.,I cannot let that six-year-oldnkeep dictating my life anymore.,I have to put him back in his place. 
 So this is where I went onlinenand looked for help.,Google was my friend. 
 (Laughter) 
 I searched, "How do I overcomenthe fear of rejection?",I came up with a bunchnof psychology articles,about where the fearnand pain are coming from.,Then I came up with a bunchnof "rah-rah" inspirational articles,about "Don't take it personally,njust overcome it.",Who doesn't know that? 
 (Laughter) 
 But why was I still so scared?,Then I found this website by luck.,It's called rejectiontherapy.com. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Rejection Therapy" was this gameninvented by this Canadian entrepreneur.,His name is Jason Comely.,And basically the idea is for 30 daysnyou go out and look for rejection,,and every day get rejected at something,,and then by the end,nyou desensitize yourself from the pain.,And I loved that idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "You know what?nI'm going to do this.,And I'll feel myselfngetting rejected 100 days.",And I came up with my own rejection ideas,,and I made a video blog out of it. 
 And so here's what I did.,This is what the blog looked like.,Day One ... 
 (Laughter) 
 Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.,So this is where I wentnto where I was working.,I came downstairs,and I saw this big guynsitting behind a desk.,He looked like a security guard.,So I just approached him.,And I was just walking,and that was the longestnwalk of my life --,hair on the backnof my neck standing up,,I was sweating and my heart was pounding.,And I got there and said,,"Hey, sir, can I borrown100 dollars from you?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And he looked up, he's like, "No.","Why?" 
 And I just said, "No? I'm sorry.",Then I turned around,nand I just ran. 
 (Laughter) 
 I felt so embarrassed.,But because I filmed myself --,so that night I was watchingnmyself getting rejected,,I just saw how scared I was.,I looked like this kidnin "The Sixth Sense.",I saw dead people. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then I saw this guy.,You know, he wasn't that menacing.,He was a chubby, loveable guy,,and he even asked me, "Why?",In fact, he invited me to explain myself.,And I could've said many things.,I could've explained,nI could've negotiated.,I didn't do any of that.,All I did was run.,I felt, wow, this is likena microcosm of my life.,Every time I felt the slightest rejection,,I would just run as fast as I could.,And you know what?,The next day, no matter what happens,,I'm not going to run.,I'll stay engaged. 
 Day Two: Request a "burger refill." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's when I went to a burger joint,,I finished lunch,nand I went to the cashier and said,,"Hi, can I get a burger refill?" 
 (Laughter) 
 He was all confused,nlike, "What's a burger refill?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Well, it's just likena drink refill but with a burger.",And he said, "Sorry,nwe don't do burger refill, man." 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is where rejection happenednand I could have run, but I stayed.,I said, "Well, I love your burgers,,I love your joint,,and if you guys do a burger refill,,I will love you guys more." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he said, "Well, OK,nI'll tell my manager about it,,and maybe we'll do it,nbut sorry, we can't do this today.",Then I left.,And by the way,,I don't think they'venever done burger refill. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think they're still there.,But the life and death feelingnI was feeling the first time,was no longer there,,just because I stayed engaged --,because I didn't run.,I said, "Wow, great,nI'm already learning things.,Great." 
 And then Day Three:nGetting Olympic Doughnuts.,This is where my lifenwas turned upside down.,I went to a Krispy Kreme.,It's a doughnut shop,in mainly the Southeastern partnof the United States.,I'm sure they have some here, too.,And I went in,,I said, "Can you make me doughnutsnthat look like Olympic symbols?,Basically, you interlinknfive doughnuts together ... ",I mean there's no waynthey could say yes, right?,The doughnut maker took me so seriously. 
 (Laughter) 
 So she put out paper,,started jotting downnthe colors and the rings,,and is like, "How can I make this?",And then 15 minutes later,,she came out with a boxnthat looked like Olympic rings.,And I was so touched.,I just couldn't believe it.,And that video gotnover five million views on Youtube.,The world couldn't believe that either. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, because of thatnI was in newspapers,,in talk shows, in everything.,And I became famous.,A lot of peoplenstarted writing emails to me,and saying, "What you'rendoing is awesome.",But you know, fame and notorietyndid not do anything to me.,What I really wanted to do was learn,,and to change myself.,So I turned the restnof my 100 days of rejection,into this playground --,into this research project.,I wanted to see what I could learn. 
 And then I learned a lot of things.,I discovered so many secrets.,For example, I found if I just don't run,,if I got rejected,,I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,",and the magic word is, "why." 
 So one day I went to a stranger's house,nI had this flower in my hand,,knocked on the door and said,,"Hey, can I plant this flowernin your backyard?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And he said, "No.",But before he could leave I said,,"Hey, can I know why?",And he said, "Well, I have this dog,that would dig upnanything I put in the backyard.,I don't want to waste your flower.,If you want to do this,ngo across the street and talk to Connie.,She loves flowers.",So that's what I did.,I went across and knockednon Connie's door.,And she was so happy to see me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then half an hour later,,there was this flowernin Connie's backyard.,I'm sure it looks better now. 
 (Laughter) 
 But had I leftnafter the initial rejection,,I would've thought,,well, it's becausenthe guy didn't trust me,,it's because I was crazy,,because I didn't dress up well,nI didn't look good.,It was none of those.,It was because what I offeredndid not fit what he wanted.,And he trusted me enoughnto offer me a referral,,using a sales term.,I converted a referral. 
 Then one day --,and I also learned that I cannactually say certain things,and maximize my chance to get a yes.,So for example,none day I went to a Starbucks,,and asked the manager,n"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?",He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?",I said, "Do you knownthose Walmart greeters?,You know, those people who sayn'hi' to you before you walk in the store,,and make sure youndon't steal stuff, basically?,I want to give a Walmart experiencento Starbucks customers." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I'm not surenthat's a good thing, actually --,Actually, I'm pretty surenit's a bad thing.,And he was like, "Oh" --,yeah, this is how he looked,nhis name is Eric --,and he was like, "I'm not sure.",This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure.",Then I ask him, "Is that weird?",He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man.",But as soon as he said that,nhis whole demeanor changed.,It's as if he's puttingnall the doubt on the floor.,And he said, "Yeah, you can do this,,just don't get too weird." 
 (Laughter) 
 So for the next hournI was the Starbucks greeter.,I said "hi" to every customernthat walked in,,and gave them holiday cheers.,By the way, I don't knownwhat your career trajectory is,,don't be a greeter. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was really boring.,But then I found I could do thisnbecause I mentioned, "Is that weird?",I mentioned the doubt that he was having.,And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?",nthat means I wasn't weird.,That means I was actuallynthinking just like him,,seeing this as a weird thing.,And again, and again,,I learned that if I mentionnsome doubt people might have,before I ask the question,,I gained their trust.,People were more likely to say yes to me. 
 And then I learnednI could fulfill my life dream ...,by asking.,You know, I camenfrom four generations of teachers,,and my grandma has always told me,,"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,,but it'd be greatnif you became a teacher." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I wanted to benan entrepreneur, so I didn't.,But it has always been my dreamnto actually teach something.,So I said, "What if I just ask,and teach a college class?",I lived in Austin at the time,,so I went to Universitynof Texas at Austin,and knocked on professors' doorsnand said, "Can I teach your class?",I didn't get anywherenthe first couple of times.,But because I didn't run --nI kept doing it --,and on the third trynthe professor was very impressed.,He was like, "No onenhas done this before.",And I came in preparednwith powerpoints and my lesson.,He said, "Wow, I can use this.,Why don't you come back in two months?nI'll fit you in my curriculum.",And two months laternI was teaching a class. 
 This is me -- you probably can't see,nthis is a bad picture.,You know, sometimes you getnrejected by lighting, you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 But wow --,when I finished teaching that class,nI walked out crying,,because I thought,I could fulfill my life dreamnjust by simply asking.,I used to think I have to accomplishnall these things --,have to be a great entrepreneur,nor get a PhD to teach --,but no, I just asked,,and I could teach. 
 And in that picture,nwhich you can't see,,I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.,Why? Because in my research I foundnthat people who really change the world,,who change the way we livenand the way we think,,are the people who were metnwith initial and often violent rejections.,People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,,like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,,or even Jesus Christ.,These people did notnlet rejection define them.,They let their own reactionnafter rejection define themselves.,And they embraced rejection. 
 And we don't have to be those peoplento learn about rejection,,and in my case,,rejection was my curse,,was my boogeyman.,It has bothered me my whole lifenbecause I was running away from it.,Then I started embracing it.,I turned that intonthe biggest gift in my life.,I started teaching peoplenhow to turn rejections into opportunities.,I use my blog, I use my talk,,I use the book I just published,,and I'm even building technology to helpnpeople overcome their fear of rejection. 
 When you get rejected in life,,when you are facing the next obstacle,or next failure,,consider the possibilities.,Don't run.,If you just embrace them,,they might become your gifts as well. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Blah blah blah blah blah.,Blah blah blah blah,,blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah.,Blah blah blah, blah. 
 So what the hell was that?,Well, you don't knownbecause you couldn't understand it.,It wasn't clear.,But hopefully, it was saidnwith enough conviction,that it was at leastnalluringly mysterious. 
 Clarity or mystery?,I'm balancing these two thingsnin my daily work as a graphic designer,,as well as my daily life as a New Yorker,every day,,and there are two elementsnthat absolutely fascinate me. 
 Here's an example.,Now, how many people know what this is?,Okay. Now how many peoplenknow what this is?,Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokesnby the genius Charles M. Schulz,,we now have seven deft strokesnthat in and of themselves,create an entire emotional life,,one that has enthrallednhundreds of millions of fans,for over 50 years.,This is actually a cover of a book,that I designed about the worknof Schulz and his art,,which will be coming out this fall,,and that is the entire cover.,There is no other typographic informationnor visual information on the front,,and the name of the booknis "Only What's Necessary.",So this is sort of symbolic aboutnthe decisions I have to make every day,about the design that I'm perceiving,,and the design I'm creating. 
 So clarity.,Clarity gets to the point.,It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.,We ask ourselves this.n["When should you be clear?"] 
 Now, something like this,nwhether we can read it or not,,needs to be really, really clear.,Is it? 
 This is a rather recent examplenof urban clarity that I just love,,mainly because I'm always latenand I am always in a hurry.,So when these meters started showing upna couple of years ago on street corners,,I was thrilled, because now I finally knew,how many seconds I hadnto get across the street,before I got run over by a car.,Six? I can do that. (Laughter) 
 So let's look at the yinnto the clarity yang,,and that is mystery.,Mystery is a lot more complicatednby its very definition.,Mystery demands to be decoded,,and when it's done right,nwe really, really want to.,["When should you be mysterious?"],In World War II, the Germansnreally, really wanted to decode this,,and they couldn't. 
 Here's an example of a designnthat I've done recently,for a novel by Haruki Murakami,,who I've done design work fornfor over 20 years now,,and this is a novel about a young mannwho has four dear friends,who all of a sudden,nafter their freshman year of college,,completely cut him offnwith no explanation,,and he is devastated.,And the friends' names each havena connotation in Japanese to a color.,So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue,nthere's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.,Tsukuru Tazaki, his namendoes not correspond to a color,,so his nickname is Colorless, andnas he's looking back on their friendship,,he recalls that they were likenfive fingers on a hand.,So I created this sort of abstractnrepresentation of this,,but there's a lot more going onnunderneath the surface of the story,,and there's more going on underneathnthe surface of the jacket.,The four fingers are now four train lines,in the Tokyo subway system,,which has significance within the story.,And then you haventhe colorless subway line,intersecting with eachnof the other colors,,which basically he doesnlater on in the story.,He catches up with each of these people,to find out why they treated himnthe way they did. 
 And so this is the three-dimensionalnfinished product,sitting on my desk in my office,,and what I was hoping for herenis that you'll simply be allured,by the mystery of what this looks like,,and will want to read it,to decode and find out and make more clearnwhy it looks the way it does. 
 ["The Visual Vernacular."] 
 This is a way to use a morenfamiliar kind of mystery.,What does this mean?,This is what it means.n["Make it look like something else."],The visual vernacular is the waynwe are used to seeing a certain thing,applied to something else so thatnwe see it in a different way. 
 This is an approach I wanted to takento a book of essays by David Sedaris,that had this title at the time.n["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"],Now, the challenge here was thatnthis title actually means nothing.,It's not connected to anynof the essays in the book.,It came to the author's boyfriendnin a dream.,Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) --nso usually, I am creating a design,that is in some way based on the text,nbut this is all the text there is.,So you've got this mysterious titlenthat really doesn't mean anything,,so I was trying to think:,Where might I see a bit of mysterious textnthat seems to mean something but doesn't?,And sure enough, not long after,,one evening after a Chinese meal,,this arrived, and I thought,n"Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter),I've always loved the hilariouslynmysterious tropes of fortune cookies,that seem to mean something extremely deep,but when you think about them -- if younthink about them -- they really don't.,This says, "Hardly anyone knows how muchnis gained by ignoring the future.",Thank you. (Laughter),But we can take this visual vernacularnand apply it to Mr. Sedaris,,and we are so familiarnwith how fortune cookie fortunes look,that we don't even neednthe bits of the cookie anymore.,We're just seeing this strange thing,and we know we love David Sedaris,,and so we're hoping thatnwe're in for a good time. 
 ["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"]nDavid Rakoff was a wonderful writer,and he called his first book "Fraud",because he was getting sentnon assignments by magazines,to do things that henwas not equipped to do.,So he was this skinny little urban guy,and GQ magazine would send himndown the Colorado River,whitewater rafting to seenif he would survive.,And then he would write about it,nand he felt that he was a fraud,and that he was misrepresenting himself.,And so I wanted the cover of this booknto also misrepresent itself,and then somehow showna reader reacting to it. 
 This led me to graffiti.,I'm fascinated by graffiti.,I think anybody who livesnin an urban environment,encounters graffiti all the time,nand there's all different sorts of it.,This is a picture I tooknon the Lower East Side,of just a transformer box on the sidewalk,and it's been tagged like crazy.,Now whether you look at this and think,n"Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,",or you look at it and say,n"That's illegal abuse of property,",the one thing I think we can all agree on,is that you cannot read it.,Right? There is no clear message here.,There is another kind of graffitinthat I find far more interesting,,which I call editorial graffiti.,This is a picture I took recentlynin the subway,,and sometimes you seenlots of prurient, stupid stuff,,but I thought this was interesting,nand this is a poster that is saying,rah-rah Airbnb,,and someone has taken a Magic Marker,and has editorialized aboutnwhat they think about it.,And it got my attention. 
 So I was thinking, how do wenapply this to this book?,So I get the book by this person,nand I start reading it, and I'm thinking,,this guy is not who he says nhe is; he's a fraud.,And I get out a red Magic Marker,,and out of frustration justnscribble this across the front.,Design done. (Laughter),And they went for it! (Laughter),Author liked it, publisher liked it,,and that is how the booknwent out into the world,,and it was really fun to seenpeople reading this on the subway,and walking around with itnand what have you,,and they all sort of lookednlike they were crazy.,(Laughter) 
 ["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"]nOkay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,,a good friend, I've workednwith him for many years.,He is probably best known as the author,of "The Black Dahlia"nand "L.A. Confidential.",His most recent novel was called this,nwhich is a very mysterious name,that I'm sure a lot of people knownwhat it means, but a lot of people don't.,And it's a story about a Japanese-Americanndetective in Los Angeles in 1941,investigating a murder.,And then Pearl Harbor happens,,and as if his lifenwasn't difficult enough,,now the race relationsnhave really ratcheted up,,and then the Japanese-Americanninternment camps are quickly created,,and there's lots of tension,and horrible stuff as he's stillntrying to solve this murder.,And so I did at first thinknvery literally about this in terms of,all right, we'll take Pearl Harbornand we'll add it to Los Angeles,and we'll make this apocalyptic dawnnon the horizon of the city.,And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor,just grafted onto Los Angeles.,My editor in chief said,n"You know, it's interesting,but I think you can do betternand I think you can make it simpler.",And so I went backnto the drawing board, as I often do.,But also, being alive to my surroundings,,I work in a high-rise in Midtown,,and every night,nbefore I leave the office,,I have to push this button to get out,,and the big heavy glass doors opennand I can get onto the elevator.,And one night, all of a sudden,,I looked at this and I saw it in a waynthat I hadn't really noticed it before.,Big red circle, danger.,And I thought this was so obvious,that it had to have beenndone a zillion times,,and so I did a Google image search,nand I couldn't find another book cover,that looked quite like this,,and so this is reallynwhat solved the problem,,and graphically it's more interesting,and creates a bigger tensionnbetween the idea,of a certain kind of sunrisencoming up over L.A. and America. 
 ["'Gulp' A tour of the humanndigestive system by Mary Roach."] 
 Mary Roach is an amazing writer,who takes potentially mundanenscientific subjects,and makes them not mundane at all;nshe makes them really fun.,So in this particular case,,it's about the human digestive system.,So I'm trying to figure out whatnis the cover of this book going to be.,This is a self-portrait. (Laughter),Every morning I look at myselfnin the medicine cabinet mirror,to see if my tongue is black.,And if it's not, I'm good to go.,(Laughter),I recommend you all do this.,But I also started thinking,nhere's our introduction.,Right? Into the human digestive system.,But I think what we can all agree on,is that actual photographsnof human mouths, at least based on this,,are off-putting. (Laughter),So for the cover, then,nI had this illustration done,which is literally more palatable,and reminds us that it's bestnto approach the digestive system,from this end.,(Laughter),I don't even have to completenthe sentence. All right. 
 ["Unuseful mystery"],What happens when claritynand mystery get mixed up?,And we see this all the time.,This is what I call unuseful mystery.,I go down into the subway --nI take the subway a lot --,and this piece of papernis taped to a girder.,Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,,and the train's about to come and I'mntrying to figure out what this means,,and thanks a lot.,Part of the problem here is thatnthey've compartmentalized the information,in a way they think is helpful,nand frankly, I don't think it is at all.,So this is mystery we do not need.,What we need is useful clarity,nso just for fun, I redesigned this.,This is using all the same elements.,(Applause),Thank you. I am still waitingnfor a call from the MTA. (Laughter),You know, I'm actually not evennusing more colors than they use.,They just didn't even bothernto make the 4 and the 5 green,,those idiots. (Laughter),So the first thing we seenis that there is a service change,,and then, in two complete sentencesnwith a beginning, a middle and an end,,it tells us what the change isnand what's going to be happening.,Call me crazy! (Laughter) 
 ["Useful mystery"]nAll right.,Now, here is a piecenof mystery that I love:,packaging.,This redesign of the Diet Coke can,by Turner Duckworthnis to me truly a piece of art.,It's a work of art. It's beautiful.,But part of what makes itnso heartening to me as a designer,is that he's taken the visualnvernacular of Diet Coke --,the typefaces, the colors,nthe silver background --,and he's reduced themnto their most essential parts,,so it's like going backnto the Charlie Brown face.,It's like, how can you give them justnenough information so they know what it is,but giving them the creditnfor the knowledge that they already have,about this thing?,It looks great, and you would goninto a delicatessen,and all of a sudden see that on the shelf,nand it's wonderful.,Which makes the next thing --,["Unuseful clarity"] --nall the more disheartening,,at least to me.,So okay, again, going backndown into the subway,,after this came out,,these are pictures that I took.,Times Square subway station:,Coca-Cola has bought outnthe entire thing for advertising. Okay?,And maybe some of younknow where this is going.,Ahem. 
 "You moved to New Yorknwith the clothes on your back,,the cash in your pocket,nand your eyes on the prize.,You're on Coke." (Laughter),"You moved to New Yorknwith an MBA, one clean suit,,and an extremely firm handshake.,You're on Coke." (Laughter),These are real! (Laughter),Not even the support beams were spared,,except they switched into Yoda mode.n(Laughter),"Coke you're on." (Laughter),["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"],This campaign was a huge misstep.,It was pulled almost instantlyndue to consumer backlash,and all sorts of unflatteringnparodies on the web --,(Laughter) --,and also that dot next to "You're on,"nthat's not a period, that's a trademark.,So thanks a lot. 
 So to me, this was just so bizarre,about how they could get the packagingnso mysteriously beautiful and perfect,and the message so unbearably,nclearly wrong.,It was just incredible to me. 
 So I just hope that I've been ablento share with you some of my insights,on the uses of claritynand mystery in my work,,and maybe how you might decidento be more clear in your life,,or maybe to be a bit more mysteriousnand not so over-sharing.,(Laughter) 
 And if there's just one thingnthat I leave you with from this talk,,I hope it's this:,Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.n["'Judge This,' Chip Kidd"],Blih blih blah blah blah.nBlah blah blah. 
 Blah blah. 
 (Applause)I have a question.,Can a computer write poetry?,This is a provocative question.,You think about it for a minute,,and you suddenly have a bunchnof other questions like:,What is a computer?,What is poetry?,What is creativity?,But these are questions,that people spend their entirenlifetime trying to answer,,not in a single TED Talk.,So we're going to have to tryna different approach. 
 So up here, we have two poems.,One of them is written by a human,,and the other one's written by a computer.,I'm going to ask you to tell menwhich one's which.,Have a go: 
 Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /nMy thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.,Am I not / A fly like thee? /nOr art not thou / A man like me? 
 Poem 2: We can feel / Activistnthrough your life's / morning /,Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Nonnall the night to start a / great otherwise (...) 
 Alright, time's up.,Hands up if you think Poem 1nwas written by a human.,OK, most of you.,Hands up if you think Poem 2nwas written by a human.,Very brave of you,,because the first one was writtennby the human poet William Blake.,The second one was written by an algorithm,that took all the languagenfrom my Facebook feed on one day,and then regenerated it algorithmically,,according to methods that I'll describena little bit later on.,So let's try another test.,Again, you haven't got ages to read this,,so just trust your gut. 
 Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.nIt is interesting / and fascinating,that a bird will fly and not / roarnor bark. Enthralling stories about animals,are in my dreams and I will sing them allnif I / am not exhausted or weary. 
 Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolatensodas! / You are really beautiful!,Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins!nAll / the stuff they've always talked about (...) 
 Alright, time's up.,So if you think the first poemnwas written by a human,,put your hand up.,OK.,And if you think the second poemnwas written by a human,,put your hand up.,We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.,It was much harder. 
 The answer is,,the first poem was generatednby an algorithm called Racter,,that was created back in the 1970s,,and the second poem was writtennby a guy called Frank O'Hara,,who happens to benone of my favorite human poets. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what we've just done nownis a Turing test for poetry.,The Turing test was first proposednby this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,,in order to answer the question,,can computers think?,Alan Turing believed that ifna computer was able,to have a to have a text-basednconversation with a human,,with such proficiencynsuch that the human couldn't tell,whether they are talkingnto a computer or a human,,then the computer can be saidnto have intelligence. 
 So in 2013, my friendnBenjamin Laird and I,,we created a Turing testnfor poetry online.,It's called bot or not,,and you can go and play it for yourselves.,But basically, it's the gamenwe just played.,You're presented with a poem,,you don't know whether it was writtennby a human or a computer,and you have to guess.,So thousands and thousandsnof people have taken this test online,,so we have results. 
 And what are the results?,Well, Turing said that if a computerncould fool a human,30 percent of the timenthat it was a human,,then it passes the Turing testnfor intelligence.,We have poems on the bot or not database,that have fooled 65 percentnof human readers into thinking,it was written by a human.,So, I think we have an answernto our question.,According to the logic of the Turing test,,can a computer write poetry?,Well, yes, absolutely it can.,But if you're feelingna little bit uncomfortable,with this answer, that's OK.,If you're having a bunchnof gut reactions to it,,that's also OK becausenthis isn't the end of the story. 
 Let's play our third and final test.,Again, you're going to have to read,and tell me which you think is human. 
 Poem 1: Red flags the reasonnfor pretty flags. / And ribbons.,Ribbons of flags / And wearing material /nReasons for wearing material. (...) 
 Poem 2: A wounded deer leapsnhighest, / I've heard the daffodil,I've heard the flag to-day /nI've heard the hunter tell; /,'Tis but the ecstasy of death, /nAnd then the brake is almost done (...) 
 OK, time is up.,So hands up if you think Poem 1nwas written by a human.,Hands up if you think Poem 2nwas written by a human.,Whoa, that's a lot more people.,So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1,was written by the verynhuman poet Gertrude Stein.,And Poem 2 was generatednby an algorithm called RKCP.,Now before we go on, let me describenvery quickly and simply,,how RKCP works.,So RKCP is an algorithmndesigned by Ray Kurzweil,,who's a director of engineering at Google,and a firm believernin artificial intelligence.,So, you give RKCP a source text,,it analyzes the source text in ordernto find out how it uses language,,and then it regenerates language,that emulates that first text. 
 So in the poem we just saw before,,Poem 2, the one that you allnthought was human,,it was fed a bunch of poems,by a poet called Emily Dickinson,it looked at the way she used language,,learned the model,,and then it regenerated a modelnaccording to that same structure.,But the important thing to know about RKCP,is that it doesn't know the meaningnof the words it's using.,The language is just raw material,,it could be Chinese,nit could be in Swedish,,it could be the collected languagenfrom your Facebook feed for one day.,It's just raw material.,And nevertheless, it's ablento create a poem,that seems more humannthan Gertrude Stein's poem,,and Gertrude Stein is a human. 
 So what we've done here is,nmore or less, a reverse Turing test.,So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,nis able to write a poem,that fools a majoritynof human judges into thinking,that it was written by a computer.,Therefore, according to the logicnof the reverse Turing test,,Gertrude Stein is a computer. 
 (Laughter) 
 Feeling confused?,I think that's fair enough. 
 So far we've had humansnthat write like humans,,we have computers that writenlike computers,,we have computers that write like humans,,but we also have,nperhaps most confusingly,,humans that write like computers. 
 So what do we take from all of this?,Do we take that William Blakenis somehow more of a human,than Gertrude Stein?,Or that Gertrude Stein is morenof a computer than William Blake? 
 (Laughter) 
 These are questionsnI've been asking myself,for around two years now,,and I don't have any answers.,But what I do have are a bunch of insights,about our relationship with technology. 
 So my first insight is that,nfor some reason,,we associate poetry with being human.,So that when we ask,n"Can a computer write poetry?",we're also asking,,"What does it mean to be human,and how do we put boundariesnaround this category?,How do we say who or whatncan be part of this category?",This is an essentiallynphilosophical question, I believe,,and it can't be answerednwith a yes or no test,,like the Turing test.,I also believe that Alan Turingnunderstood this,,and that when he devisednhis test back in 1950,,he was doing itnas a philosophical provocation. 
 So my second insight is that,nwhen we take the Turing test for poetry,,we're not really testingnthe capacity of the computers,because poetry-generating algorithms,,they're pretty simple and have existed,nmore or less, since the 1950s.,What we are doing with the Turingntest for poetry, rather,,is collecting opinions about whatnconstitutes humanness.,So, what I've figured out,,we've seen this when earlier today,,we say that William Blakenis more of a human,than Gertrude Stein.,Of course, this doesn't meannthat William Blake,was actually more human,or that Gertrude Steinnwas more of a computer.,It simply means that the categorynof the human is unstable.,This has led me to understand,that the human is not a cold, hard fact.,Rather, it is somethingnthat's constructed with our opinions,and something that changes over time. 
 So my final insight is thatnthe computer, more or less,,works like a mirrornthat reflects any idea of a human,that we show it.,We show it Emily Dickinson,,it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.,We show it William Blake,,that's what it reflects back to us.,We show it Gertrude Stein,,what we get back is Gertrude Stein.,More than any other bit of technology,,the computer is a mirror that reflectsnany idea of the human we teach it. 
 So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing,a lot about artificialnintelligence recently.,And much of the conversation is,,can we build it?,Can we build an intelligent computer?,Can we build a creative computer?,What we seem to be asking over and over,is can we build a human-like computer? 
 But what we've seen just now,is that the humannis not a scientific fact,,that it's an ever-shifting,nconcatenating idea,and one that changes over time.,So that when we beginnto grapple with the ideas,of artificial intelligence in the future,,we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,,"Can we build it?",But we should also be asking ourselves,,"What idea of the humanndo we want to have reflected back to us?",This is an essentially philosophical idea,,and it's one that can't be answerednwith software alone,,but I think requires a momentnof species-wide, existential reflection. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to start by asking you allnto go to your happy place, please.,Yes, your happy place,,I know you've got one even if it's fake. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so, comfortable?,Good. 
 Now I'd like to you to mentally answernthe following questions.,Is there any strip lightingnin your happy place?,Any plastic tables?,Polyester flooring?,Mobile phones?,No?,I think we all know that our happy place,is meant to bensomewhere natural, outdoors --,on a beach, fireside.,We'll be reading or eating or knitting.,And we're surroundednby natural light and organic elements.,Natural things make us happy.,And happiness is a great motivator;nwe strive for happiness.,Perhaps that's whynwe're always redesigning everything,,in the hopes that our solutionsnmight feel more natural.,So let's start there --,with the idea that good designnshould feel natural. 
 Your phone is not very natural.,And you probably thinknyou're addicted to your phone,,but you're really not.,We're not addicted to devices,,we're addicted to the informationnthat flows through them.,I wonder how long you would benhappy in your happy place,without any informationnfrom the outside world.,I'm interested in how we accessnthat information,,how we experience it.,We're moving from a timenof static information,,held in books and libraries and bus stops,,through a period of digital information,,towards a period of fluid information,,where your children will expect to be ablento access anything, anywhere at any time,,from quantum physicsnto medieval viticulture,,from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,,just like switching on a lightbulb --,Imagine that. 
 Humans also like simple tools.,Your phone is not a very simple tool.,A fork is a simple tool. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we don't like them made of plastic,,in the same way I don't really likenmy phone very much --,it's not how I wantnto experience information. 
 I think there are better solutionsnthan a world mediated by screens.,I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --,and I don't think any of us feel that good,about how much timenwe spend slouched over them.,Fortunately,,the big tech companies seem to agree.,They're actually heavily investednin touch and speech and gesture,,and also in senses --,things that can turnndumb objects, like cups,,and imbue them with the magicnof the Internet,,potentially turning this digital cloud,into something we might touch and move. 
 The parents in crisis over screen time,need physical digital toysnteaching their kids to read,,as well as family-safe app stores.,And I think, actually,nthat's already really happening. 
 Reality is richer than screens.,For example, I love books.,For me they are time machines --natoms and molecules bound in space,,from the moment of their creationnto the moment of my experience.,But frankly,,the content's identical on my phone.,So what makes thisna richer experience than a screen?,I mean, scientifically.,We need screens, of course.,I'm going to show film,nI need the enormous screen.,But there's more than you can donwith these magic boxes.,Your phone is notnthe Internet's door bitch. 
 (Laughter) 
 We can build things --nphysical things,,using physics and pixels,,that can integrate the Internetninto the world around us.,And I'm going to show youna few examples of those. 
 A while ago, I got to worknwith a design agency, Berg,,on an exploration of what the Internetnwithout screens might actually look like.,And they showed us a range ways,that light can work with simple sensesnand physical objects,to really bring the Internet to life,nto make it tangible.,Like this wonderfully mechanicalnYouTube player.,And this was an inspiration to me. 
 Next I worked withnthe Japanese agency, AQ,,on a research project into mental health.,We wanted to create an object,that could capture the subjective datanaround mood swings,that's so essential to diagnosis.,This object captures your touch,,so you might press itnvery hard if you're angry,,or stroke it if you're calm.,It's like a digital emoji stick.,And then you might revisitnthose moments later,,and add context to them online.,Most of all,,we wanted to createnan intimate, beautiful thing,that could live in your pocket,and be loved. 
 The binoculars are actuallyna birthday present,for the Sydney Opera House'sn40th anniversary.,Our friends at Tellart in Bostonnbrought over a pair of street binoculars,,the kind you might findnon the Empire State Building,,and they fitted them with 360-degree views,of other iconic world heritage sights -- 
 (Laughter) 
 using Street View.,And then we stuck them under the steps.,So, they became this very physical,nsimple reappropriation,,or like a portal to these other icons.,So you might see Versaillesnor Shackleton's Hut.,Basically, it's virtualnreality circa 1955. 
 (Laughter) 
 In our office we usenhacky sacks to exchange URLs.,This is incredibly simple,nit's like your Opal card.,You basically put a websitenon the little chip in here,,and then you do this and ... bosh! --,the website appears on your phone.,It's about 10 cents. 
 Treehugger is a projectnthat we're working on,with Grumpy Sailor and Finch,nhere in Sydney.,And I'm very excitednabout what might happen,when you pull the phones apartnand you put the bits into trees,,and that my childrennmight have an opportunity,to visit an enchanted forestnguided by a magic wand,,where they could talk to digital fairiesnand ask them questions,,and be asked questions in return.,As you can see,,we're at the cardboard stagenwith this one. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'm very excited,by the possibility of getting kidsnback outside without screens,,but with all the powerful magicnof the Internet at their fingertips.,And we hope to have something like thisnworking by the end of the year. 
 So let's recap.,Humans like natural solutions.,Humans love information.,Humans need simple tools.,These principles should underpinnhow we design for the future,,not just for the Internet.,You may feel uncomfortable about the agenof information that we're moving into.,You may feel challenged,nrather than simply excited.,Guess what? Me too.,It's a really extraordinary periodnof human history. 
 We are the peoplenthat actually build our world,,there are no artificial intelligences...,yet. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's us -- designers, architects,nartists, engineers.,And if we challenge ourselves,,I think that actuallynwe can have a happy place,filled with the information we love,that feels as natural and as simplenas switching on lightbulb.,And although it may seem inevitable,,that what the public wantsnis watches and websites and widgets,,maybe we could give a bit of thoughtnto cork and light and hacky sacks. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Every day, I listen to harrowing storiesnof people fleeing for their lives,,across dangerous bordersnand unfriendly seas.,But there's one storynthat keeps me awake at night,,and it's about Doaa. 
 A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,,she was living a grinding existencenin Egypt working day wages.,Her dad was constantly thinkingnof his thriving business back in Syria,that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.,And the war that drove them therenwas still raging in its fourth year.,And the communitynthat once welcomed them there,had become weary of them.,And one day, men on motorcyclesntried to kidnap her.,Once an aspiring studentnthinking only of her future,,now she was scared all the time. 
 But she was also full of hope,,because she was in lovenwith a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.,Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,nand he said to Doaa,,"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.,I will work, you can study --nthe promise of a new life.",And he asked her fathernfor her hand in marriage. 
 But they knew to get to Europenthey had to risk their lives,,traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,,putting their hands in smugglers',nnotorious for their cruelty.,And Doaa was terrified of the water.,She always had been.nShe never learned to swim. 
 It was August that year,nand already 2,000 people had died,trying to cross the Mediterranean,,but Doaa knew of a friend who had made itnall the way to Northern Europe,,and she thought, "Maybe we can, too.",So she asked her parents if they could go,,and after a painful discussion,nthey consented,,and Bassem paid his entire life savings --n2,500 dollars each --,to the smugglers. 
 It was a Saturday morningnwhen the call came,,and they were taken by bus to a beach,nhundreds of people on the beach.,They were taken then by small boatsnonto an old fishing boat,,500 of them crammed onto that boat,,300 below, [200] above.,There were Syrians, Palestinians,nAfricans, Muslims and Christians,,100 children, including Sandra --nlittle Sandra, six years old --,and Masa, 18 months.,There were families on that boat,ncrammed together shoulder to shoulder,,feet to feet.,Doaa was sitting with her legsncrammed up to her chest,,Bassem holding her hand. 
 Day two on the water,nthey were sick with worry,and sick to their stomachsnfrom the rough sea. 
 Day three, Doaa had a premonition.,And she said to Bassem,n"I fear we're not going to make it.,I fear the boat is going to sink.",And Bassem said to her,n"Please be patient.,We will make it to Sweden,nwe will get married,and we will have a future." 
 Day four, the passengersnwere getting agitated.,They asked the captain,n"When will we get there?",He told them to shut up,nand he insulted them.,He said, "In 16 hours we will reachnthe shores of Italy.",They were weak and weary.,Soon they saw a boat approach --na smaller boat, 10 men on board,,who started shouting at them,nhurling insults,,throwing sticks, asking themnto all disembark,and get on this smaller,nmore unseaworthy boat.,The parents were terrifiednfor their children,,and they collectivelynrefused to disembark.,So the boat sped away in anger,,and a half an hour later, came back,and started deliberately ramming a holenin the side of Doaa's boat,,just below where shenand Bassem were sitting.,And she heard how they yelled,,"Let the fish eat your flesh!",And they started laughingnas the boat capsized and sank. 
 The 300 people below deck were doomed.,Doaa was holding on to the sidenof the boat as it sank,,and watched in horror as a small childnwas cut to pieces by the propeller.,Bassem said to her, "Please let go,,or you'll be swept in and the propellernwill kill you, too.",And remember -- she can't swim.,But she let go and she started movingnher arms and her legs,,thinking, "This is swimming.",And miraculously,nBassem found a life ring.,It was one of those child's rings,that they use to playnin swimming pools and on calm seas.,And Doaa climbed onto the ring,,her arms and her legsndangling by the side.,Bassem was a good swimmer,,so he held her hand and tread water.,Around them there were corpses.,Around 100 people survived initially,,and they started coming togethernin groups, praying for rescue.,But when a day went by and no one came,,some people gave up hope,,and Doaa and Bassem watched,as men in the distance took theirnlife vests off and sank into the water. 
 One man approached themnwith a small baby perched on his shoulder,,nine months old -- Malek.,He was holding onto a gas canisternto stay afloat, and he said to them,,"I fear I am not going to survive.,I'm too weak. I don't haventhe courage anymore.",And he handed little Maleknover to Bassem and to Doaa,,and they perched her onto the life ring.,So now they were three,nDoaa, Bassem and little Malek. 
 And let me take a pausenin this story right here,and ask the question:,why do refugees like Doaantake these kinds of risks?,Millions of refugees are livingnin exile, in limbo.,They're living in countries [fleeing]nfrom a war that has been raging,for four years.,Even if they wanted to return, they can't.,Their homes, their businesses,,their towns and their citiesnhave been completely destroyed.,This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,,Homs, in Syria.,So people continue to fleeninto neighboring countries,,and we build refugee campsnfor them in the desert.,Hundreds of thousands of peoplenlive in camps like these,,and thousands and thousands more,nmillions, live in towns and cities.,And the communities,,the neighboring countriesnthat once welcomed them,with open arms and hearts,are overwhelmed.,There are simply not enough schools,nwater systems, sanitation.,Even rich European countriesncould never handle such an influx,without massive investment.,The Syria war has driven almostnfour million people over the borders,,but over seven million peoplenare on the run inside the country.,That means that over halfnthe Syrian population,has been forced to flee.,Back to those neighboringncountries hosting so many.,They feel that the richer worldnhas done too little to support them.,And days have turned into months,nmonths into years.,A refugee's stay is supposednto be temporary. 
 Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.,It was their second day,nand Bassem was getting very weak.,And now it was Doaa's turnnto say to Bassem,,"My love, please hold on to hope,nto our future. We will make it.",And he said to her,,"I'm sorry, my love,nthat I put you in this situation.,I have never loved anyonenas much as I love you.",And he released himself into the water,,and Doaa watched as the love of her lifendrowned before her eyes. 
 Later that day,,a mother came up to Doaa with hernsmall 18-month-old daughter, Masa.,This was the little girl I showed younin the picture earlier,,with the life vests.,Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,,and her mother knew she had to doneverything in her power,to save her daughter.,And she said to Doaa,n"Please take this child.,Let her be part of you.nI will not survive.",And then she went away and drowned. 
 So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugeenwho was terrified of the water,,who couldn't swim,,found herself in chargenof two little baby kids.,And they were thirsty and they were hungrynand they were agitated,,and she tried her best to amuse them,,to sing to them, to say wordsnto them from the Quran.,Around them, the bodies were bloatingnand turning black.,The sun was blazing during the day.,At night, there was a cold moon and fog.,It was very frightening.,On the fourth day in the water,nthis is how Doaa probably looked,on the ring with her two children. 
 A woman came on the fourth daynand approached her,and asked her to take another child --,a little boy, just four years old.,When Doaa took the little boynand the mother drowned,,she said to the sobbing child,,"She just went awaynto find you water and food.",But his heart soon stopped,,and Doaa had to releasenthe little boy into the water. 
 Later that day,,she looked up into the sky with hope,,because she saw two planesncrossing in the sky.,And she waved her arms,nhoping they would see her,,but the planes were soon gone. 
 But that afternoon,nas the sun was going down,,she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.,And she said, "Please, God,nlet them rescue me.",She waved her arms and she feltnlike she shouted for about two hours.,And it had become dark,nbut finally the searchlights found her,and they extended a rope,,astonished to see a womannclutching onto two babies. 
 They pulled them onto the boat,nthey got oxygen and blankets,,and a Greek helicopter camento pick them up,and take them to the island of Crete. 
 But Doaa looked down and asked,n"What of Malek?",And they told her the little babyndid not survive --,she drew her last breathnin the boat's clinic.,But Doaa was sure that as they hadnbeen pulled up onto the rescue boat,,that little baby girl had been smiling. 
 Only 11 people survivednthat wreck, of the 500.,There was never an internationalninvestigation into what happened.,There were some media reportsnabout mass murder at sea,,a terrible tragedy,,but that was only for one day.,And then the news cycle moved on. 
 Meanwhile, in a pediatricnhospital on Crete,,little Masa was on the edge of death.,She was really dehydrated.nHer kidneys were failing.,Her glucose levels were dangerously low.,The doctors did everythingnin their medical power to save them,,and the Greek nurses never left her side,,holding her, hugging her,nsinging her words.,My colleagues also visitednand said pretty words to her in Arabic.,Amazingly, little Masa survived. 
 And soon the Greek press started reportingnabout the miracle baby,,who had survived four days in the waternwithout food or anything to drink,,and offers to adopt her camenfrom all over the country. 
 And meanwhile, Doaanwas in another hospital on Crete,,thin, dehydrated.,An Egyptian family took her into theirnhome as soon as she was released.,And soon word went aroundnabout Doaa's survival,,and a phone numbernwas published on Facebook.,Messages started coming in. 
 "Doaa, do you knownwhat happened to my brother?,My sister? My parents? My friends?nDo you know if they survived?" 
 One of those messages said,,"I believe you savednmy little niece, Masa.",And it had this photo.,This was from Masa's uncle,,a Syrian refugee who had made itnto Sweden with his family,and also Masa's older sister.,Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunitednwith him in Sweden,,and until then, she's being cared fornin a beautiful orphanage in Athens. 
 And Doaa? Well, word went aroundnabout her survival, too.,And the media wrotenabout this slight woman,,and couldn't imagine hownshe could survive all this time,under such conditions in that sea,,and still save another life.,The Academy of Athens, one of Greece'snmost prestigious institutions,,gave her an award of bravery,,and she deserves all that praise,,and she deserves a second chance.,But she wants to still go to Sweden.,She wants to reunitenwith her family there.,She wants to bring her mothernand her father and her younger siblings,away from Egypt there as well,,and I believe she will succeed.,She wants to become a lawyernor a politician,or something that can helpnfight injustice.,She is an extraordinary survivor. 
 But I have to ask:,what if she didn't have to take that risk?,Why did she have to go through all that?,Why wasn't there a legal waynfor her to study in Europe?,Why couldn't Masa have takennan airplane to Sweden?,Why couldn't Bassem have found work?,Why is there no massive resettlementnprogram for Syrian refugees,,the victims of the worst war of our times?,The world did this for the Vietnamesenin the 1970s. Why not now?,Why is there so little investmentnin the neighboring countries,hosting so many refugees?,And why, the root question,,is so little being done to stopnthe wars, the persecution,and the poverty that is drivingnso many people,to the shores of Europe?,Until these issues are resolved,,people will continue to take to the seas,and to seek safety and asylum. 
 And what happens next?,Well, that is largely Europe's choice.,And I understand the public fears.,People are worried about their security,ntheir economies, the changes of culture.,But is that more importantnthan saving human lives?,Because there is somethingnfundamental here,that I think overrides the rest,,and it is about our common humanity.,No person fleeing war or persecution,should have to diencrossing a sea to reach safety. 
 (Applause) 
 One thing is for sure,,that no refugee would benon those dangerous boats,if they could thrive where they are.,And no migrant would takenthat dangerous journey,if they had enough foodnfor themselves and their children.,And no one would put their life savings,in the hands of those notorious smugglers,if there was a legal way to migrate. 
 So on behalf of little Masa,and on behalf of Doaa,and of Bassem,and of those 500 peoplenwho drowned with them,,can we make sure that theyndid not die in vain?,Could we be inspired by what happened,,and take a stand for a worldnin which every life matters? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Welcome to Bayeku,,a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --,a vivid representation of severalnriverine communities across Nigeria,,communities whose waterwaysnhave been infested,by an invasive aquatic weed;,communities where economic livelihoodsnhave been hampered:,fishing, marine transportation,and trading;,communities where fish yieldsnhave diminished;,communities where schoolchildrennare unable to go to school,for days, sometimes weeks, on end.,Who would have thought that this plant,with round leaves, inflated stems,nand showy, lavender flowers,would cause such havocnin these communities. 
 The plant is known as water hyacinth,and its botanical name,nEichhornia crassipes.,Interestingly, in Nigeria,nthe plant is also known by other names,,names associated with historical events,,as well as myths.,In some places,nthe plant is called Babangida.,When you hear Babangida, you remembernthe military and military coups.,And you think: fear, restraint.,In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta,nthe plant is also known as Abiola.,When you hear Abiola,nyou remember annulled elections,and you think: dashed hopes.,In the southwestern part of Nigeria,,the plant is known as Gbe'borun.,Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase,which translates to "gossip,"nor "talebearer.",When you think of gossip, you think:nrapid reproduction, destruction.,And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,,the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,,And when you hear that,nyou think of death.,It literally translatesnto "death to mother and child." 
 I personally had my encounternwith this plant in the year 2009.,It was shortly after I had relocatednfrom the US to Nigeria.,I'd quit my job in corporate America,and decided to takenthis big leap of faith,,a leap of faith that camenout of a deep sense of conviction,that there was a lot of worknto do in Nigeria,in the area of sustainable development.,And so here I was in the year 2009,,actually, at the end of 2009,,in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge. 
 And I looked to my leftnand saw this very arresting image.,It was an image of fishing boats,that had been hemmed innby dense mats of water hyacinth.,And I was really pained by what I saw,because I thought to myself,,"These poor fisherfolk,,how are they goingnto go about their daily activities,with these restrictions.",And then I thought,n"There's got to be a better way.",A win-win solution wherebynthe environment is taken care of,by the weeds being cleared out of the way,and then this being turnedninto an economic benefit,for the communitiesnwhose lives are impacted the most,by the infestation of the weed.,That, I would say, was my spark moment. 
 And so I did further researchnto find out more,about the beneficial uses of this weed.,Out of the several,none struck me the most.,It was the use of the plantnfor handicrafts.,And I thought, "What a great idea.",Personally, I love handicrafts,,especially handicraftsnthat are woven around a story.,And so I thought, "This could beneasily deployed within the communities,without the requirementnof technical skills.",And I thought to myself,n"Three simple steps to a mega solution." 
 First step: Get out into the waterwaysnand harvest the water hyacinth.,That way, you create access. 
 Secondly, you drynthe water hyacinth stems. 
 And thirdly, you weaventhe water hyacinth into products. 
 The third step was a challenge.,See, I'm a computer scientistnby background,and not someone in the creative arts.,And so I began my quest,to find out how I can learn how to weave. 
 And this quest took mento a community in Ibadan, where I lived,,called Sabo.,Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters.",And the community isnpredominantly made up of people,from the northern part of the country.,So I literally tooknmy dried weeds in hand,,there were several more of them,,and went knocking from door to doornto find out who could teach me,how to weave thesenwater hyacinth stems into ropes.,And I was directednto the shed of Malam Yahaya.,The problem, though,nis that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English,and neither did I speak Hausa.,But some little kids came to the rescue,and helped translate.,And that began my journeynof learning how to weave,and transform thesendried water hyacinth stems,into long ropes. 
 With my long ropes in hand,,I was now equipped to make products.,And that was the beginningnof partnerships.,Working with rattan basket makersnto come up with products.,So with this in hand, I felt confident,that I would be ablento take this knowledge,back into the riverine communities,and help them to transformntheir adversity into prosperity.,So taking these weedsnand actually weaving them,into products that can be sold.,So we have pens, we have tableware,,we have purses, we have tissue boxes.,Thereby, helping the communities,to see water hyacinthnin a different light.,Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,,being aesthetic,nbeing durable, tough, resilient.,Changing names, changing livelihoods. 
 From Gbe'borun, gossip,,to Olusotan, storyteller.,And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma,nwhich is "killer of mother and child,",to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,,"provider of food for mother and child." 
 And I'd like to endnwith a quote by Michael Margolis.,He said, "If you want to learnnabout a culture, listen to the stories.,And if you want to change a culture,nchange the stories." 
 And so, from Makoko community,nto Abobiri, to Ewoi,,to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,,we have changed the story. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)It was the middle of summernand well past closing time,in the downtown Berkeley barnwhere my friend Polly and I,worked together as bartenders.,Usually at the end of our shiftnwe had a drink -- but not that night.,"I'm pregnant.,Not sure what I'm goingnto do yet," I told Polly.,Without hesitation, she replied,n"I've had an abortion.",Before Polly, no one had ever told menthat she'd had an abortion.,I'd graduated from collegenjust a few months earlier,and I was in a new relationshipnwhen I found out that I was pregnant.,When I thought about my choices,nI honestly did not know how to decide,,what criteria I should use.,How would I know whatnthe right decision was?,I worried that I would regret nan abortion later.,Coming of age on the beachesnof Southern California,,I grew up in the middle of nour nation's abortion wars.,I was born in a trailer on the thirdnanniversary of Roe vs. Wade.,Our community was surfing Christians.,We cared about God, the less fortunate,nand the ocean.,Everyone was pro-life.,As a kid, the idea of abortion made me sonsad that I knew if I ever got pregnant,I could never have one.,And then I did.,It was a step towards the unknown.,But Polly had given mena very special gift:,the knowledge that I wasn't alone,and the realization that abortionnwas something that we can talk about.,Abortion is common.,According to the Guttmacher Institute,none in three women in America,will have an abortion in their lifetime.,But for the last few decades, the dialoguenaround abortion in the United States,has left little room for anything beyond npro-life and pro-choice.,It's political and polarizing. 
 But as much as abortion is hotly debated,nit's still rare for us,,whether as fellow womennor even just as fellow people,,to talk with one anothernabout the abortions that we have.,There is a gap.,Between what happens in politicsnand what happens in real life,,and in that gap, a battlefield mentality.,An "are you with us nor against us?" stance takes root.,This isn't just about abortion.,There are so many important issues nthat we can't talk about.,And so finding ways to shift the conflictnto a place of conversation,is the work of my life.,There are two main ways to get started.,One way is to listen closely.,And the other way is to share stories.,So, 15 years ago, I cofoundednan organization called Exhale,to start listening to people nwho have had abortions.,The first thing we did was create na talk-line, where women and men,could call to get emotional support.,Free of judgment and politics,nbelieve it or not, nothing like our sevice,had ever existed.,We needed a new framework that could nhold all the experiences that we were,hearing on our talk-line.,The feminist who regrets her abortion.,The Catholic who is grateful for hers.,The personal experiences that weren't nfitting neatly into one box or the other.,We didn't think it was right nto ask women to pick a side.,We wanted to show them thatnthe whole world was on their side,,as they were going through this deeplynpersonal experience.,So we invented "pro-voice." 
 Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hardnissues that we've struggled with globally,for years,,issues like immigration, religiousntolerance, violence against women.,It also works on deeply personal topics nthat might only matter to you,and your immediate family and friends.,They have a terminal illness, ntheir mother just died,,they have a child with special needsnand they can't talk about it.,Listening and storytelling arenthe hallmarks of pro-voice practice.,Listening and storytelling.,That sounds pretty nice.,Sounds maybe, easy?nWe could all do that.,It's not easy.nIt's very hard.,Pro-voice is hard because we are talkingnabout things everyone's fighting about,or the things that no one nwants to talk about.,I wish I could tell you that when you ndecide to be pro-voice, that you'll find,beautiful moments of breakthrough nand gardens full of flowers,,where listening and storytellingncreates wonderful "a-ha" moments.,I wish I could tell you that there wouldnbe a feminist welcoming party for you,,or that there's a long-lost sisterhoodnof people who are just ready,to have your back when you get slammed.,But it can be vulnerable and exhausting nto tell our own stories,when it feels like nobody cares.,And if we truly listen to one another,,we will hear things that demandnthat we shift our own perceptions.,There is no perfect timenand there is no perfect place,to start a difficult conversation.,There's never a time when everyone will benon the same page, share the same lens,,or know the same history.,So, let's talk about listeningnand how to be a good listener.,There's lots of ways to be a good listenernand I'm going to give you just a couple.,One is to ask open-ended questions.,You can ask yourself or someone nthat you know,,"How are you feeling?","What was that like?","What do you hope for, now?",Another way to be a good listener nis to use reflective language.,If someone is talking aboutntheir own personal experience,,use the words that they use.,If someone is talking about an abortionnand they say the word "baby,",you can say "baby.",If they say "fetus,"nyou can say "fetus.",If someone describes themselvesnas gender queer to you,,you can say "gender queer.",If someone kind of looks like a he,nbut they say they're a she -- it's cool.,Call that person a she.,When we reflect the language of the personnwho is sharing their own story,,we are conveying that we are interestednin understanding who they are,and what they're going through.,The same way that we hope people are ninterested in knowing us.,So, I'll never forget being in one nof the Exhale counselor meetings,,listening to a volunteer talk about hownshe was getting a lot of calls,from Christian women who nwere talking about God.,Now, some of our volunteers are religious,nbut this particular one was not.,At first, it felt a little weird for her nto talk to callers about God.,So, she decided to get comfortable.,And she stood in front of her mirror nat home, and she said the word "God.","God.","God.","God.","God.","God.","God.",Over and over and over againnuntil the word no longer felt strange,coming out her mouth.,Saying the word God did not turn this nvolunteer into a Christian,,but it did make her a much nbetter listener of Christian women.,So, another way to be pro-voicenis to share stories,,and one risk that you take on, when younshare your story with someone else,,is that given the samenset of circumstances as you,they might actuallynmake a different decision.,For example, if you're telling a story nabout your abortion,,realize that she might have had the baby.,She might have placed for adoption.,She might have told her parents nand her partner -- or not.,She might have felt relief and confidence,neven though you felt sad and lost.,This is okay.,Empathy gets created the moment wenimagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.,It doesn't mean we all have nto end up in the same place.,It's not agreement, it's not samenessnthat pro-voice is after.,It creates a culture and a society that nvalues what make us special and unique.,It values what makes us human,nour flaws and our imperfections.,And this way of thinking allows us to seenour differences with respect,,instead of fear.,And it generates the empathy that we need,to overcome all the waysnthat we try to hurt one another.,Stigma, shame, prejudice, ndiscrimination, oppression.,Pro-voice is contagious,nand the more it's practiced,the more it spreads.,So, last year I was pregnant again.,This time I was looking forward nto the birth of my son.,And while pregnant, I had never been askednhow I was feeling so much in all my life.,(Laughter),And however I replied, whether I wasnfeeling wonderful and excited,or scared and totally freaked out,,there was always someone therengiving me a "been there" response.,It was awesome.,It was a welcome, yet dramaticndeparture from what I experience,when I talk aboutnmy mixed feelings of my abortion.,Pro-voice is about the real storiesnof real people,making an impact on the way abortion,and so many other politicizednand stigmatized issues,are understood and discussed.,From sexuality and mental healthnto poverty and incarceration.,Far beyond definitionnas single right or wrong decisions,,our experiences can exist on a spectrum.,Pro-voice focuses that conversationnon human experience,and it makes support and respectnpossible for all.,Thank you.,(Applause)Pat Mitchell: So I was thinkingnabout female friendship a lot,,and by the way, these two women,,I'm very honored to say,,have been my friendsnfor a very long time, too.,Jane Fonda: Yes we have. 
 PM: And one of the thingsnthat I read about female friendship,is something that Cervantes said.,He said, "You can tellna lot about someone,",in this case a woman,,"by the company that she keeps.",So let's start with -- 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: We're in big trouble. 
 Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,,I'm extremely dry. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: You're taking up our time.,We have a very limited -- 
 LT: Just being with hernsucks the life out of me. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.,Anyway -- sorry. 
 PM: So tell me, what do younlook for in a friend? 
 LT: I look for someonenwho has a sense of fun,,who's audacious,,who's forthcoming, who has politics,,who has even a small scrapnof passion for the planet,,someone who's decent,nhas a sense of justice,and who thinks I'm worthwhile. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,,I don't even know what I would donwithout my women friends.,I mean it's, "I have my friends,ntherefore I am." 
 LT: (Laughter) 
 JF: No, it's true.,I exist because I havenmy women friends. They --,You're one of them.,I don't know about you. But anyway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, they make me stronger,nthey make me smarter,,they make me braver.,They tap me on the shoulder when I mightnbe in need of course-correcting.,And most of them arena good deal younger than me, too.,You know? I mean, it's nice --nLT: Thank you. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: No, I do, I include you in that,nbecause listen, you know --,it's nice to have somebody still aroundnto play with and learn from,when you're getting toward the end.,I'm approaching --nI'll be there sooner than you. 
 LT: No, I'm glad to have younparallel aging alongside me. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: I'm showing you the way. 
 (Laughter) 
 LT: Well, you are and you have. 
 PM: Well, as we grow older,,and as we go throughndifferent kinds of life's journeys,,what do you do to keepnyour friendships vital and alive? 
 LT: Well you have to use a lot of -- 
 JF: She doesn't invite me over much,nI'll tell you that. 
 LT: I have to use a lot of social media --,You be quiet now. And so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 LT: And I look through my emails,nI look through my texts,to find my friends,,so I can answer themnas quickly as possible,,because I know they need my counsel. 
 (Laughter) 
 They need my support,,because most of my friendsnare writers, or activists, or actors,,and you're all three ...,and a long stringnof other descriptive phrases,,and I want to get to younas soon as possible,,I want you to know that I'm there for you. 
 JF: Do you do emojis? 
 LT: Oh ...nJF: No? 
 LT: That's embarrassing.nJF: I'm really into emojis. 
 LT: No, I spell out my --,I spell out my words of happinessnand congratulations,,and sadness. 
 JF: You spell it right out -- 
 LT: I spell it, every letter. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: Such a purist.,You know, as I've gotten older,,I've understood morenthe importance of friendships,,and so, I really make an effort,to reach out and make play dates --nnot let too much time go by.,I read a lot,so, as Lily knows all too well,,my books that I like,nI send to my friends. 
 LT: When we knew we would be here today,you sent me a lot of booksnabout women, female friendships,,and I was so surprisednto see how many books,,how much researchnhas been done recently -- 
 JF: And were you grateful?nLT: I was grateful. 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: And -- 
 LT: Wait, no, it's really importantnbecause this is another example,of how women are overlooked,nput aside, marginalized.,There's been very littlenresearch done on us,,even though we volunteered lots of times. 
 JF: That's for sure. 
 (Laughter) 
 LT: This is really exciting,nand you all will be interested in this.,The Harvard Medical School study has shown,that women who havenclose female friendships,are less likely to develop impairments --,physical impairments as they age,,and they are likely to be seennto be living much more vital, exciting -- 
 JF: And longer -- 
 LT: Joyful lives. 
 JF: We live five years longer than men. 
 LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy. 
 (Laughter) 
 LT: But the most importantnpart is they found --,the results were so excitingnand so conclusive --,the researchers found,that not having close female friendsnis detrimental to your health,,as much as smoking or being overweight. 
 JF: And there's something else, too -- 
 LT: I've said my part, so ... 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: OK, well, listen to my part,nbecause there's an additional thing.,Because they only --nfor years, decades --,they only researched men when theynwere trying to understand stress,,only very recently have they researchednwhat happens to women when we're stressed,,and it turns outnthat when we're stressed -- women,,our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.,Which is a feel-good, calming,nstress-reducing hormone.,Which is also increasednwhen we're with our women friends.,And I do think that's one reasonnwhy we live longer.,And I feel so bad for mennbecause they don't have that.,Testosterone in menndiminishes the effects of oxytocin. 
 LT: Well, when you and Inand Dolly made "9 to 5" ... 
 JF: Oh -- 
 LT: We laughed, we did,nwe laughed so much,,we found we had so much in commonnand we're so different.,Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,,I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,,[Dolly's] a Southern kidnfrom a poor town in Tennessee,,and we found we were so in sync as women,,and we must have --,we laughed -- we must have addednat least a decade onto our lifespans. 
 JF: I think -- we surencrossed our legs a lot. 
 (Laughter),If you know what I mean. 
 LT: I think we all know what you mean. 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: You're adding decadesnto our lives right now.,So among the books that Janensent us both to read on female friendship,was one by a woman we admire greatly,nSister Joan Chittister,,who said about female friendship,that women friendsnare not just a social act,,they're a spiritual act.,Do you think of your friends as spiritual?,Do they add somethingnspiritual to your lives? 
 LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.,Because -- especially peoplenyou've known a long time,,people you've spent time with --,I can see the spiritualnessence inside them,,the tenderness, the vulnerability.,There's actually kind of a love,nan element of love in the relationship.,I just see deeply into your soul. 
 PM: Do you think that, Jane -- 
 LT: But I have special powers. 
 JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.,There's business friends,nand party friends,,I've got a lot of those. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the oxytocin-producingnfriendships have ...,They feel spiritualnbecause it's a heart opening, right?,You know, we go deep. And --,I find that I shed tears a lotnwith my intimate friends.,Not because I'm sad but becausenI'm so touched and inspired by them. 
 LT: And you know one of younis going to go soon. 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: Well, two of us are sitting here,nLily, which one are you talking about? 
 (Laughter),And I always think, when womenntalk about their friendships,,that men always look a little mystified.,What are the differences, in your opinion,,between men friendshipsnand women friendships? 
 JF: There's a lot of difference,,and I think we have to havena lot of empathy for men -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that they don't have what we have.,Which I think may be why they die sooner. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have a lot of compassion for men,,because women, no kidding, we --,women's relationships, our friendshipsnare full disclosure, we go deep.,They're revelatory.,We risk vulnerability --nthis is something men don't do.,I mean how many timesnhave I asked you, "Am I doing OK?","Did I really screw up there?" 
 PM: You're doing great. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that,of our women friends,,and men don't.,You know, people describe women'snrelationships as face-to-face,,whereas men's friendshipsnare more side-by-side. 
 LT: I mean most of the timenmen don't want to reveal their emotions,,they want to bury deeper feelings.,I mean, that's the general,nconventional thought.,They would rather go off in their man cavenand watch a game or hit golf balls,,or talk about sports,nor hunting, or cars or have sex.,I mean, it's just the kind of --nit's a more manly behavior. 
 JF: You meant --nLT: They talk about sex.,I meant they might have sex,if they could get somebodynin their man cave to -- 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: You know something, though,nthat I find very interesting --,and again, psychologists didn't know thisnuntil relatively recently --,is that men are born every bitnas relational as women are.,If you look at filmsnof newborn baby boys and girls,,you'll see the baby boysnjust like the girls,,gazing into their mother's eyes,,you know, needing that relationalnexchange of energy.,When the mother looks away,nthey could see the dismay on the child,,even the boy would cry.,They need relationship.,So the question is why,nas they grow older, does that change?,And the answer is patriarchal culture,,which says to boys and young men,that to be needing of relationship,nto be emotional with someone is girly.,That a real man doesn't askndirections or express a need,,they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.,They don't ask for help.,There's a quote that I really like,,"Men fear that becoming 'we'nwill erase his 'I'.",You know, his sense of self.,Whereas women's sense of selfnhas always been kind of porous.,But our "we" is our saving grace,,it's what makes us strong.,It's not that we're better than men,,we just don't havenour masculinity to prove. 
 LT: And, well -- 
 JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.,So we can express our humanity --nLT: I know who Gloria Steinem is. 
 JF: I know you know who she is,nbut I think it's a -- 
 (Laughter) 
 No, but it's a great quote, I think.,We're not better than men, we justndon't have our masculinity to prove.,And that's really important. 
 LT: But men arenso inculcated in the culture,to be comfortable in the patriarchy.,And we've got to makensomething different happen. 
 JF: Women's friendshipsnare like a renewable source of power. 
 LT: Well, that's what's excitingnabout this subject.,It's because our friendships --,female friendshipsnare just a hop to our sisterhood,,and sisterhood can bena very powerful force,,to give the world --,to make it what it should be --,the things that humans desperately need. 
 PM: It is why we're talking about it,,because women's friendships are,,as you said, Jane,,a renewable source of power.,So how do we use that power? 
 JF: Well, women are the fastest growingndemographic in the world,,especially older women.,And if we harness our power,nwe can change the world.,And guess what? We need to. 
 (Applause) 
 And we need to do it soon.,And one of the thingsnthat we need to do --,and we can do it as women --,for one thing, we kind of setnthe consumer standards.,We need to consume less.,We in the Western worldnneed to consume less,and when we buy things, we need tonbuy things that are made locally,,when we buy food, we need to buy foodnthat's grown locally.,We are the onesnthat need to get off the grid.,We need to make ourselvesnindependent from fossil fuels.,And the fossil fuel companies --,the Exxons and the Shell Oilsnand those bad guys --,cause they are --,are going to tell us that we can't do itnwithout going back to the Stone Age.,You know, that the alternativesnjust aren't quite there yet,,and that's not true.,There are countries in the world right now,that are living mostly on renewablenenergy and doing just fine.,And they tell us that if we donwean ourselves from fossil fuel,that we're going to benback in the Stone Age,,and in fact, if we beginnto use renewable energy,,and not drill in the Arctic,nand not drill -- 
 LT: Oh, boy. 
 JF: And not drillnin the Alberta tar sands --,Right.,That we will be --,there will be more democracynand more jobs and more well-being,,and it's women that arengoing to lead the way. 
 LT: Maybe we have the momentumnto start a third-wave feminist movement,with our sisterhood around the world,,with women we don't see,nwomen we may never meet,,but we join together that way,,because --,Aristotle said --,most people --,people would die without male friendships.,And the operative word here was "male.",Because they thought that friendshipsnshould be between equals,and women were not considered equal -- 
 JF: They didn't thinknwe had souls even, the Greeks. 
 LT: No, exactly. That shows younjust how limited Aristotle was. 
 (Laughter) 
 And wait, no, here's the best part.,It's like, you know,nmen do need women now.,The planet needs women.,The US Constitution needs women.,We are not even in the Constitution. 
 JF: You're talking aboutnthe Equal Rights Amendment. 
 LT: Right.,Justice Ginsberg said something like --,every constitution that's been writtennsince the end of World War II,included a provision that made womenncitizens of equal stature,,but ours does not.,So that would be a good place to start.,Very, very mild -- 
 JF: Right. 
 (Applause) 
 And gender equality, it's like a tide,,it would lift all boats, not just women. 
 PM: Needing new role modelsnon how to do that.,How to be friends,,how to think about our powernin different ways,,as consumers,,as citizens of the world,,and this is what makes Jane and Lily,a role model of hownwomen can be friends --,for a very long time,,and even if they occasionally disagree. 
 Thank you.,Thank you both. 
 (Applause) 
 JF: Thanks. 
 LT: Thank you. 
 JF: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Jenni Chang: When I toldnmy parents I was gay,,the first thing they said to me was,,"We're bringing you back to Taiwan." 
 (Laughter) 
 In their minds, my sexual orientationnwas America's fault.,The West had corrupted menwith divergent ideas,,and if only my parentsnhad never left Taiwan,,this would not have happenednto their only daughter.,In truth, I wondered if they were right. 
 Of course, there are gay people in Asia,,just as there are gay peoplenin every part of the world.,But is the idea of living an "out" life,,in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse,nand we're proud of our lives together",kind of way just a Western idea? 
 If I had grown up in Taiwan,nor any place outside of the West,,would I have found modelsnof happy, thriving LGBT people? 
 Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.,As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,,I had met many gay immigrants.,They told me their storiesnof persecution in their home countries,,just for being gay,,and the reasonsnwhy they escaped to the US.,I saw how this had beaten them down.,After 10 years of doing this kind of work,,I needed better stories for myself.,I knew the world was far from perfect,,but surely not every gay story was tragic. 
 JC: So as a couple, we both had a neednto find stories of hope.,So we set off on a missionnto travel the world,and look for the peoplenwe finally termed as the "Supergays." 
 (Laughter) 
 These would be the LGBT individuals,who were doing somethingnextraordinary in the world.,They would be courageous, resilient,,and most of all, proud of who they were.,They would be the kind of personnthat I aspire to be.,Our plan was to share their storiesnto the world through film. 
 LD: There was just one problem.,We had zero reportingnand zero filmmaking experience. 
 (Laughter) 
 We didn't even knownwhere to find the Supergays,,so we just had to trust that we'dnfigure it all out along the way.,So we picked 15 countriesnin Asia, Africa and South America,,countries outside the Westnthat varied in terms of LGBT rights.,We bought a camcorder,,ordered a booknon how to make a documentary -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you can learn a lot these days --,and set off on an around-the-world trip. 
 JC: One of the first countriesnthat we traveled to was Nepal.,Despite widespread poverty,na decade-long civil war,,and now recently,na devastating earthquake,,Nepal has made significant stridesnin the fight for equality.,One of the key figuresnin the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.,A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,,Bhumika has had to overcomenbeing expelled from school,and getting incarceratednbecause of her gender presentation.,But, in 2007, Bhumikanand Nepal's LGBT rights organization,successfully petitionednthe Nepali Supreme Court,to protect against LGBT discrimination. 
 Here's Bhumika: 
 (Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?,I'm a transgendered person.,I'm so proud of my life.,On December 21, 2007,,the supreme court gave the decisionnfor the Nepal government,to give transgender identity cards,and same-sex marriage. 
 LD: I can appreciatenBhumika's confidence on a daily basis.,Something as simplenas using a public restroom,can be a huge challengenwhen you don't fit in,to people's strict gender expectations.,Traveling throughout Asia,,I tended to freak out womennin public restrooms.,They weren't used to seeingnsomeone like me.,I had to come up with a strategy,nso that I could just pee in peace. 
 (Laughter) 
 So anytime I would enter a restroom,,I would thrust out my chestnto show my womanly parts,,and try to be asnnon-threatening as possible.,Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello",,just so that peoplencould hear my feminine voice.,This all gets pretty exhausting,nbut it's just who I am.,I can't be anything else. 
 JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.,On one hand, India is a Hindu society,,without a tradition of homophobia.,On the other hand, it is also a societynwith a deeply patriarchal system,,which rejects anythingnthat threatens the male-female order.,When we spoke to activists,,they told us that empowerment beginsnwith ensuring proper gender equality,,where the women's statusnis established in society.,And in that way, the status of LGBT peoplencan be affirmed as well. 
 LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.,He's the world's first openly gay prince.,Prince Manvendra came outnon the "Oprah Winfrey Show,",very internationally.,His parents disowned him,and accused him of bringingngreat shame to the royal family.,We sat down with Prince Manvendra,and talked to him about why he decidednto come out so very publicly. 
 Here he is: 
 (Video) Prince Manvendra: nI felt there was a lot of need,to break this stigma and discriminationnwhich is existing in our society.,And that instigated me to come out openlynand talk about myself.,Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,nwe are transgender, bisexual,or whatever sexual minority we come from,,we have to all unitenand fight for our rights.,Gay rights cannot be wonnin the court rooms,,but in the hearts and the mindsnof the people. 
 JC: While getting my hair cut,,the woman cutting my hair asked me,,"Do you have a husband?",Now, this was a dreaded question,that I got asked a lotnby locals while traveling.,When I explained to hernthat I was with a woman instead of a man,,she was incredulous,,and she asked me a lot of questionsnabout my parents' reactions,and whether I was sadnthat I'd never be able to have children.,I told her that there arenno limitations to my life,and that Lisa and I do plannto have a family some day.,Now, this woman was ready to write me off,as yet another crazy Westerner.,She couldn't imaginenthat such a phenomenon,could happen in her own country.,That is, until I showed hernthe photos of the Supergays,that we interviewed in India.,She recognized Prince Manvendranfrom television,and soon I had an audiencenof other hairdressers,interested in meeting me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in that ordinary afternoon,,I had the chance to introducenan entire beauty salon,to the social changesnthat were happening in their own country. 
 LD: From India,nwe traveled to East Africa,,a region known for intolerancentowards LGBT people.,In Kenya, 89 percent of peoplenwho come out to their families,are disowned.,Homosexual acts are a crimenand can lead to incarceration.,In Kenya, we metnthe soft-spoken David Kuria.,David had a huge missionnof wanting to work for the poor,and improve his own government.,So he decided to run for senate.,He became Kenya's firstnopenly gay political candidate.,David wanted to run his campaignnwithout denying the reality of who he was.,But we were worried for his safety,because he startednto receive death threats. 
 (Video) David Kuria: nAt that point, I was really scared,because they werenactually asking for me to be killed.,And, yeah,,there are some people out there who do it,and they feel that they are doingna religious obligation. 
 JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.,Even in the face of threats,,he stayed authentic. 
 LD: At the opposite endnof the spectrum is Argentina.,Argentina's a country where 92 percentnof the population identifies as Catholic.,Yet, Argentina has LGBT lawsnthat are even more progressive,than here in the US.,In 2010, Argentina becamenthe first country in Latin America,and the 10th in the worldnto adopt marriage equality. 
 There, we met María Rachid.,María was a driving forcenbehind that movement. 
 María Rachid (Spanish):nI always say that, in reality,,the effects of marriage equality,are not only for those couplesnthat get married.,They are for a lot of people that,neven though they may never get married,,will be perceived differentlynby their coworkers,,their families and neighbors,,from the national state'snmessage of equality.,I feel very proud of Argentina,because Argentina todaynis a model of equality.,And hopefully soon,,the whole world will have the same rights. 
 JC: When we made the visitnto my ancestral lands,,I wish I could have shownnmy parents what we found there.,Because here is who we met: 
 (Video) One, two, three.nWelcome gays to Shanghai! 
 (Laughter) 
 A whole community of young,nbeautiful Chinese LGBT people.,Sure, they had their struggles.,But they were fighting it out.,In Shanghai, I had the chancento speak to a local lesbian group,and tell them our storynin my broken Mandarin Chinese.,In Taipei, each timenwe got onto the metro,,we saw yet anothernlesbian couple holding hands.,And we learned that Asia'snlargest LGBT pride event,happens just blocks awaynfrom where my grandparents live.,If only my parents knew. 
 LD: By the time we finished ournnot-so-straight journey around the world, 
 (Laughter) 
 we had traveled 50,000 miles,and logged 120 hours of video footage.,We traveled to 15 countries,and interviewed 50 Supergays.,Turns out, it wasn't hardnto find them at all. 
 JC: Yes, there are stillntragedies that happen,on the bumpy road to equality.,And let's not forget that 75 countriesnstill criminalize homosexuality today.,But there are also storiesnof hope and courage,in every corner of the world.,What we ultimately took awaynfrom our journey is,,equality is not a Western invention. 
 LD: One of the key factorsnin this equality movement is momentum,,momentum as more and more peoplenembrace their full selves,and use whatever opportunities they have,to change their part of the world,,and momentum as more and more countries,find models of equality in one another.,When Nepal protectednagainst LGBT discrimination,,India pushed harder.,When Argentina embraced marriage equality,,Uruguay and Brazil followed.,When Ireland said yes to equality, 
 (Applause) 
 the world stopped to notice.,When the US Supreme Courtnmakes a statement to the world,that we can all be proud of. 
 (Applause) 
 JC: As we reviewed our footage,,what we realized is thatnwe were watching a love story.,It wasn't a love storynthat was expected of me,,but it is one fillednwith more freedom, adventure and love,than I could have ever possibly imagined.,One year after returning homenfrom our trip,,marriage equality came to California.,And in the end, we believe,nlove will win out. 
 (Video) By the power vested in me,,by the state of California,and by God Almighty,,I now pronounce you spouses for life.,You may kiss. 
 (Applause)(Guitar music starts)

 (Ambient/guitar music starts) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause)A girl I've never met before,changed my life and the lifenof thousands of other people.,I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.,It's one of the largest organizationsnin the world for young people.,In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scoutsnin the United States.,And we're not homophobic. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's true -- the way we communicatenwith young people is by text,,because that's hownyoung people communicate.,So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,,things like collecting peanut butternfor food pantries,,or making Valentine's Day cardsnfor senior citizens who are homebound.,And we'll text them.,And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.,It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.,We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter,and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.,This is big scale. OK -- 
 (Applause) 
 But there's one weird side effect.,Every time we send out a text message,,we get back a few dozen text messagesnhaving nothing to do with peanut butter,or hunger or senior citizens --,but text messages about being bullied,,text messages about being addicted to pot.,And the worst messagenwe ever got said exactly this:,"He won't stop raping me.,It's my dad.,He told me not to tell anyone.nAre you there?" 
 We couldn't believe this was happening.,We couldn't believe that somethingnso horrific could happen to a human being,,and that she would share it with us --nsomething so intimate, so personal.,And we realizednwe had to stop triaging this,and we had to build a crisis text linenfor these people in pain.,So we launched Crisis Text Line,,very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso --njust a few thousand people in each market.,And in four months,nwe were in all 295 area codes in America.,Just to put that into perspective,,that's zero marketing and faster growthnthan when Facebook first launched. 
 (Applause) 
 Text is unbelievably private.,No one hears you talking.,So we spike everyday at lunch time --,kids are sitting at the lunch table,and you think that she's textingnthe cute boy across the hall,,but she's actually texting usnabout her bulimia.,And we don't get the word "like"nor "um" or hyperventilating or crying.,We just get facts. 
 We get things like, "I want to die.,I have a bottle of pillsnon the desk in front of me.",And so the crisis counselor says,,"How about you put those pillsnin the drawer while we text?",And they go back and forth for a while.,And the crisis counselorngets the girl to give her her address,,because if you're textingna text line, you want help.,So she gets the address,and the counselor triggersnan active rescue,while they're texting back and forth.,And then it goes quiet --,23 minutes with no responsenfrom this girl.,And the next message that comes in says --,it's the mom --,"I had no idea, and I was in the house,,we're in an ambulancenon our way to the hospital.",As a mom that one just --,The next message comes a month later.,"I just got out of the hospital.,I was diagnosed as bipolar,nand I think I'm going to be OK." 
 (Applause) 
 I would love to tell younthat that's an unusual exchange,,but we're doing on averagen2.41 active rescues a day.,Thirty percent of our text messagesnare about suicide and depression -- huge.,The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line,is that these are strangersncounseling other strangers,on the most intimate issues,,and getting them from hot momentsnto cold moments.,It's exciting, and I will tell you,that we have done a totalnof more than 6.5 million text messages,in less than two years. 
 (Applause) 
 But the thing that really gets menhot and sweaty about this,,the thing that really gets menpsyched is the data:,6.5 million messages --,that's the volume, velocity and varietynto provide a really juicy corpus.,We can do things like predictive work.,We can do all kinds of conclusionsnand learnings from that data set.,So we can be better,nand the world can be better.,So how do we use the datanto make us better?,Alright, chances are someone here,nsomeone watching this,has seen a therapist or a shrinknat some point in time in your life --,you do not have to raise your hand. 
 (Laughter) 
 How do you know that person's any good?,Oh, they have a degreenfrom Harvard on the wall?,Are you sure he didn't graduatenin the bottom 10 percent? 
 (Laughter) 
 When my husband and Insaw a marriage counselor,,I thought she was a genius when she said,,"I'll see you guys in two weeks --nbut I need to see you next week, sir." 
 (Laughter) 
 We have the data to knownwhat makes a great counselor.,We know that if you textnthe words "numbs" and "sleeve,",there's a 99 percent match for cutting.,We know that if you textnin the words "mg" and "rubber band,",there's a 99 percent matchnfor substance abuse.,And we know that if you text inn"sex," "oral" and "Mormon,",you're questioning if you're gay.,Now that's interesting informationnthat a counselor could figure out,but that algorithm in our handsnmeans that an automatic pop-up says,,"99 percent match for cutting --ntry asking one of these questions",to prompt the counselor.,Or "99 percent match for substance abuse,,here are three drug clinicsnnear the texter.",It makes us more accurate. 
 On the day that Robin Williamsncommitted suicide,,people flooded hotlinesnall over this country.,It was sad to see an icon,na funnyman, commit suicide,,and there were three hour wait timesnon every phone hotline in the country.,We had a spike in volume also.,The difference was,if you text us, "I want to die,"nor "I want to kill myself,",the algorithm reads that,nyou're code orange,,and you become number one in the queue.,So we can handle severity,nnot chronological. 
 (Applause) 
 This data is also making the world better,because I'm sitting on the world'snfirst map of real-time crises.,Think about it:,those 6.5 million messages, auto-taggingnthrough natural language processes,,all of these data points --,I can tell you that the worst daynof the week for eating disorders: Monday.,The worst time of daynfor substance abuse: 5am.,And that Montana isna beautiful place to visit,but you do not want to live there,,because it is the number one statenfor suicidal ideation. 
 And we've made this data publicnand free and open.,We've pulled all the personallynidentifiable information.,And it's in a placencalled CrisisTrends.org.,Because I want schools to be able to see,that Monday is the worst daynfor eating disorders,,so that they can plan meals,and guidance counselorsnto be there on Mondays.,And I want families to see thatnsubstance abuse questions spike at 5am.,I want somebody to take care of thosenNative American reservations in Montana. 
 (Applause) 
 Data, evidence,makes policy, research,,journalism, policing, school boards --neverything better.,I don't think of myselfnas a mental health activist.,I think of myselfnas a national health activist.,I get really excited about this data,nI'm a little nerdy.,Yeah, that sounded too girly.,I'm nerdy. 
 (Laughter) 
 I love data.,And the only difference really between menand those people in hoodies down the road,with their fat-funded companies,,is that I'm not inspired by helping younfind Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,,or helping you touch your wristnand get a car immediately,,or swipe right and get laid.,I'm inspired -- 
 (Laughter, applause) 
 I want to use tech and datanto make the world a better place.,I want to use it to help that girl,,who texted in about nbeing raped by her father.,Because the truth isnwe never heard from her again.,And I hope that she isnsomewhere safe and healthy,,and I hope that she sees this talk,and she knows that her desperation,and her courage inspirednthe creation of Crisis Text Line,and inspires me every freaking day. 
 (Applause)What if I could present you a story,that you would remembernwith your entire body,and not just with your mind?,My whole life as a journalist,nI've really been compelled,to try to make storiesnthat can make a difference,and maybe inspire people to care.,I've worked in print.nI've worked in documentary.,I've worked in broadcast.,But it really wasn't untilnI got involved with virtual reality,that I started seeingnthese really intense,,authentic reactions from people,that really blew my mind. 
 So the deal is that with VR,nvirtual reality,,I can put you on scene,in the middle of the story.,By putting on these gogglesnthat track wherever you look,,you get this whole-body sensation,,like you're actually, like, there.,So five years ago was about whennI really began to push the envelope,with using virtual realitynand journalism together.,And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.,Families in America are going hungry,nfood banks are overwhelmed,,and they're often running out of food.,Now, I knew I couldn'tnmake people feel hungry,,but maybe I could figure out a waynto get them to feel something physical. 
 So -- again, this is five years ago --,so doing journalismnand virtual reality together,was consideredna worse-than-half-baked idea,,and I had no funding.,Believe me, I had a lotnof colleagues laughing at me.,And I did, though,nhave a really great intern,,a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.,And together we went out to food banks,and started recordingnaudio and photographs.,Until one day she came back to my office,and she was bawling, she was just crying.,She had been on scene at a long line,,where the woman running the linenwas feeling extremely overwhelmed,,and she was screaming,n"There's too many people!,There's too many people!",And this man with diabetesndoesn't get food in time,,his blood sugar drops too low,nand he collapses into a coma.,As soon as I heard that audio,,I knew that this would benthe kind of evocative piece,that could really describenwhat was going on at food banks. 
 So here's the real line.nYou can see how long it was, right?,And again, as I said, we didn'tnhave very much funding,,so I had to reproduce itnwith virtual humans that were donated,,and people begged and borrowed favorsnto help me create the models,and make things as accurate as we could.,And then we tried to conveynwhat happened that day,with as much as accuracy as is possible. 
 (Video) Voice: There's too many people!nThere's too many people! 
 Voice: OK, he's having a seizure. 
 Voice: We need an ambulance. 
 Nonny de la Peña: So the man on the right,,for him, he's walking around the body.,For him, he's in the room with that body.,Like, that guy is at his feet.,And even though,nthrough his peripheral vision,,he can see that he's in this lab space,,he should be able to seenthat he's not actually on the street,,but he feels like he's therenwith those people.,He's very cautious not to step on this guy,who isn't really there, right? 
 So that piece ended upngoing to Sundance in 2012,,a kind of amazing thing,nand it was the first virtual reality film,ever, basically.,And when we went, I was really terrified.,I didn't really knownhow people were going to react,and what was going to happen.,And we showed upnwith this duct-taped pair of goggles. 
 (Video) Oh, you're crying.nYou're crying. Gina, you're crying. 
 So you can hearnthe surprise in my voice, right?,And this kind of reaction ended up beingnthe kind of reaction we saw,over and over and over:,people down on the groundntrying to comfort the seizure victim,,trying to whisper something into his ear,or in some way help,neven though they couldn't.,And I had a lot of peoplencome out of that piece saying,,"Oh my God, I was so frustrated.nI couldn't help the guy,",and take that back into their lives. 
 So after this piece was made,,the dean of the cinema school at USC,nthe University of Southern California,,brought in the head of the WorldnEconomic Forum to try "Hunger,",and he took off the goggles,,and he commissionedna piece about Syria on the spot.,And I really wanted to do somethingnabout Syrian refugee kids,,because children have been the worstnaffected by the Syrian civil war.,I sent a team to the border of Iraqnto record material at refugee camps,,basically an area I wouldn'tnsend a team now,,as that's where ISIS is really operating.,And then we also recreated a street scene,in which a young girl is singingnand a bomb goes off.,Now, when you'renin the middle of that scene,and you hear those sounds,,and you see the injured around you,,it's an incredibly scary and real feeling.,I've had individuals who have beenninvolved in real bombings tell me,that it evokes the same kind of fear. 
 [The civil war in Syria may seem far away],[until you experience it yourself.] 
 (Girl singing) 
 (Explosion) 
 [Project Syria],[A virtual reality experience] 
 NP: We were then invited to take the piece,to the Victoria and AlbertnMuseum in London.,And it wasn't advertised.,And we were put in this tapestry room.,There was no press about it,,so anybody who happened to walkninto the museum to visit it that day,would see us with these crazy lights.,You know, maybe they would want to seenthe old storytelling of the tapestries.,They were confrontednby our virtual reality cameras.,But a lot of people tried it,nand over a five-day run,we ended up with 54 pagesnof guest book comments,,and we were told by the curators there,that they'd never seen such an outpouring.,Things like, "It's so real,"n"Absolutely believable,",or, of course, the onenthat I was excited about,,"A real feeling as if you werenin the middle of something,that you normally see on the TV news." 
 So, it works, right? This stuff works.,And it doesn't really matternwhere you're from or what age you are --,it's really evocative. 
 Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not sayingnthat when you're in a piece,you forget that you're here.,But it turns out we can feelnlike we're in two places at once.,We can have what I callnthis duality of presence,,and I think that's what allows mento tap into these feelings of empathy.,Right? 
 So that means, of course,,that I have to be very cautiousnabout creating these pieces.,I have to really follownbest journalistic practices,and make sure that these powerful stories,are built with integrity.,If we don't capturenthe material ourselves,,we have to be extremely exacting,about figuring out the provenancenand where did this stuff come from,and is it authentic? 
 Let me give you an example.,With this Trayvon Martin case,nthis is a guy, a kid,,who was 17 years old and he boughtnsoda and a candy at a store,,and on his way home he was trackednby a neighborhood watchman,named George Zimmermannwho ended up shooting and killing him.,To make that piece,,we got the architectural drawingsnof the entire complex,,and we rebuilt the entire sceneninside and out, based on those drawings.,All of the action,is informed by the real 911nrecorded calls to the police.,And interestingly, we brokensome news with this story.,The forensic house that did the audionreconstruction, Primeau Productions,,they say that they would testify,that George Zimmerman,nwhen he got out of the car,,he cocked his gun before he wentnto give chase to Martin. 
 So you can see thatnthe basic tenets of journalism,,they don't really change here, right?,We're still following the same principlesnthat we would always.,What is different is the sensenof being on scene,,whether you're watchingna guy collapse from hunger,or feeling like you'renin the middle of a bomb scene.,And this is kind of what has driven menforward with these pieces,,and thinking about how to make them.,We're trying to make this, obviously,nbeyond the headset, more available.,We're creating mobile piecesnlike the Trayvon Martin piece.,And these things have had impact.,I've had Americans tell menthat they've donated,,direct deductions from their bank account,nmoney to go to Syrian children refugees.,And "Hunger in LA," well,nit's helped start,a new form of doing journalism,that I think is going to joinnall the other normal platforms,in the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may never have heardnof Kenema, Sierra Leone,or Arua, Nigeria.,But I know them as two of the mostnextraordinary places on earth. 
 In hospitals there, there's a communitynof nurses, physicians and scientists,that have been quietly battling,one of the deadliest threatsnto humanity for years:,Lassa virus.,Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.,It can cause a severe fevernand can often be fatal.,But these individuals,nthey risk their lives every day,to protect the individualsnin their communities,,and by doing so, protect us all. 
 But one of the most extraordinary thingsnI learned about them,on one of my first visitsnout there many years ago,was that they start each morning --,these challenging, extraordinary daysnon the front lines -- by singing.,They gather together,nand they show their joy.,They show their spirit.,And over the years,,from year after year as I've visited themnand they've visited me,,I get to gather with them and I sing,and we write and we love it,,because it reminds us that we're notnjust there to pursue science together;,we're bonded through a shared humanity. 
 And that of course, as you can imagine,nbecomes extremely important,,even essential, as things begin to change.,And that changed a great dealnin March of 2014,,when the Ebola outbreaknwas declared in Guinea.,This is the first outbreak in West Africa,,near the bordernof Sierra Leone and Liberia.,And it was frightening,nfrightening for us all.,We had actually suspected for some time,that Lassa and Ebola were morenwidespread than thought,,and we thought it couldnone day come to Kenema. 
 And so members of my teamnimmediately went out,and joined Dr. Humarr Khannand his team there,,and we set up diagnostics to be ablento have sensitive molecular tests,to pick up Ebola if it camenacross the border,and into Sierra Leone.,We'd already set up this kindnof capacity for Lassa virus,,we knew how to do it,,the team is outstanding.,We just had to give themnthe tools and place to survey for Ebola. 
 And unfortunately, that day came.,On May 23, 2014, a woman checkedninto the maternity ward at the hospital,,and the team rannthose important molecular tests,and they identified the firstnconfirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.,This was an exceptionalnwork that was done.,They were able to diagnosenthe case immediately,,to safely treat the patient,and to begin to do contact tracingnto follow what was going on.,It could've stopped something.,But by the time that day came,,the outbreak had alreadynbeen breeding for months.,With hundreds of cases, it had alreadyneclipsed all previous outbreaks.,And it came into Sierra Leonennot as that singular case,,but as a tidal wave. 
 We had to worknwith the international community,,with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,nto begin to deal with the cases,,as the next week brought 31,,then 92, then 147 cases --nall coming to Kenema,,one of the only places in Sierra Leonenthat could deal with this. 
 And we worked around the clockntrying to do everything we could,,trying to help the individuals,ntrying to get attention,,but we also did one other simple thing.,From that specimen that we takenfrom a patient's blood to detect Ebola,,we can discard it, obviously.,The other thing we can do is, actually,nput in a chemical and deactivate it,,so just place it into a boxnand ship it across the ocean,,and that's what we did.,We sent it to Boston, where my team works.,And we also worked around the clockndoing shift work, day after day,,and we quickly generated 99 genomesnof the Ebola virus.,This is the blueprint -- the genomenof a virus is the blueprint.,We all have one.,It says everything that makes up us,,and it tells us so much information. 
 The results of this kind of worknare simple and they're powerful.,We could actually takenthese 99 different viruses,,look at them and compare them,,and we could see, actually,ncompared to three genomes,that had been previouslynpublished from Guinea,,we could show that the outbreaknemerged in Guinea months before,,once into the human population,,and from there had been transmittingnfrom human to human.,Now, that's incredibly important,when you're trying to figure outnhow to intervene,,but the important thingnis contact tracing.,We also could see that as the virusnwas moving between humans,,it was mutating.,And each of those mutationsnare so important,,because the diagnostics, the vaccines,,the therapies that we're using,,are all based on that genomensequence, fundamentally --,that's what drives it.,And so global health expertsnwould need to respond,,would have to develop,,to recalibrate everythingnthat they were doing. 
 But the way that science works,nthe position I was in at that point,is, I had the data,,and I could have workednin a silo for many, many months,,analyzed the data carefully, slowly,,submitted the paper for publication,ngone through a few back-and-forths,,and then finally when the paper came out,nmight release that data.,That's the way the status quo works. 
 Well, that was not going to worknat this point, right?,We had friends on the front lines,and to us it was just obviousnthat what we needed is help,,lots of help.,So the first thing we did is,,as soon as the sequencesncame off the machines,,we published it to the web.,We just released it to the whole worldnand said, "Help us.",And help came. 
 Before we knew it,,we were being contactednfrom people all over,,surprised to see the datanout there and released.,Some of the greatestnviral trackers in the world,were suddenly part of our community.,We were working togethernin this virtual way,,sharing, regular calls, communications,,trying to follow the virusnminute by minute,,to see ways that we could stop it. 
 And there are so many waysnthat we can form communities like that.,Everybody, particularly when the outbreaknstarted to expand globally,,was reaching out to learn,nto participate, to engage.,Everybody wants to play a part.,The amount of human capacitynout there is just amazing,,and the Internet connects us all.,And could you imagine that insteadnof being frightened of each other,,that we all just said, "Let's do this.,Let's work together,nand let's make this happen." 
 But the problem is that the datanthat all of us are using,,Googling on the web, is just too limitednto do what we need to do.,And so many opportunitiesnget missed when that happens.,So in the early partnof the epidemic from Kenema,,we'd had 106 clinical recordsnfrom patients,,and we once again made thatnpublicly available to the world.,And in our own lab, we could shownthat you could take those 106 records,,we could train computers to predictnthe prognosis for Ebola patients,to near 100 percent accuracy.,And we made an appnthat could release that,,to make that availablento health-care workers in the field. 
 But 106 is just not enoughnto make it powerful,,to validate it.,So we were waiting for more datanto release that.,and the data has still not come.,We are still waiting, tweaking away,,in silos rather than working together.,And this just -- we can't accept that.,Right? You, all of you,ncannot accept that.,It's our lives on the line.,And in fact, actually,,many lives were lost,nmany health-care workers,,including beloved colleagues of mine,,five colleagues:nMbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,,Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovomanand Mohamed Fullah.,These are just fivenof many health-care workers,at Kenema and beyond,that died while the world waitednand while we all worked,,quietly and separately. 
 See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,,it's fueled by mistrustnand distraction and division.,When we build barriers amongst ourselvesnand we fight amongst ourselves,,the virus thrives.,But unlike all threats to humanity,,Ebola is one wherenwe're actually all the same.,We're all in this fight together.,Ebola on one person's doorstepncould soon be on ours.,And so in this placenwith the same vulnerabilities,,the same strengths,nthe same fears, the same hopes,,I hope that we work together with joy. 
 A graduate student of minenwas reading a book about Sierra Leone,,and she discovered that the word "Kenema,",the hospital that we work at and the citynwhere we work in Sierra Leone,,is named after the Mende wordnfor "clear like a river, translucent,and open to the public gaze.",That was really profound for us,,because without knowing it,nwe'd always felt,that in order to honor the individualsnin Kenema where we worked,,we had to work openly, we had to sharenand we had to work together.,And we have to do that.,We all have to demand thatnof ourselves and others --,to be open to each othernwhen an outbreak happens,,to fight in this fight together.,Because this is not the firstnoutbreak of Ebola,,it will not be the last,,and there are many other microbesnout there that are lying in wait,,like Lassa virus and others.,And the next time this happens,,it could happen in a city of millions,nit could start there.,It could be somethingnthat's transmitted through the air.,It could even bendisseminated intentionally.,And I know that that is frightening,nI understand that,,but I know also,nand this experience shows us,,that we have the technologynand we have the capacity,to win this thing,,to win this and haventhe upper hand over viruses.,But we can only do it if we do it together,and we do it with joy. 
 So for Dr. Khan,and for all of those who sacrificedntheir lives on the front lines,in this fight with us always,,let us be in this fight with them always.,And let us not let the world be defined,by the destruction wrought by one virus,,but illuminated by billionsnof hearts and minds,working in unity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone! 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks, Pat.,Thank you!,Getting me all wound up, now! 
 (Laughter) 
 Pat Mitchell: Good!,You know, when I was watchingnthe video again of the match,,you must have feltnlike the fate of the world's women,was on every stroke you took.,Were you feeling that? 
 BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --nhe was the former number one player,,he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.,He was one of my heroes and I admired him.,And that's the reason I beat him,nactually, because I respected him. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's true -- my momnand especially my dad always said:,"Respect your opponent,nand never underestimate them, ever.",And he was correct.nHe was absolutely correct.,But I knew it was about social change.,And I was really nervousnwhenever we announced it,,and I felt like the whole worldnwas on my shoulders.,And I thought, "If I lose, it's goingnto put women back 50 years, at least.",Title IX had just been passednthe year before -- June 23, 1972.,And women's professional tennis --,there were nine of us who signedna one-dollar contract in 1970 --,now remember, the match is in '73.,So we were only in ournthird year of having a tour,where we could actually play,nhave a place to compete and make a living.,So there were nine of us that signednthat one-dollar contract.,And our dream was for any girl,nborn any place in the world --,if she was good enough --,there would be a place for her to competenand for us to make a living.,Because before 1968,nwe made 14 dollars a day,,and we were under the controlnof organizations.,So we really wantednto break away from that.,But we knew it wasn't reallynabout our generation so much;,we knew it was aboutnthe future generations. 
 We do stand on the shoulders of the peoplenthat came before us, there is no question.,But every generationnhas the chance to make it better.,That was really on my mind.,I really wanted to start matchingnthe hearts and minds to Title IX.,Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,nwhich a lot of people probably don't,,said that any federal funds givennto a high school, college or university,,either public or private,,had to -- finally --ngive equal monies to boys and girls.,And that changed everything. 
 (Applause) 
 So you can have a law,,but it's changing the hearts and mindsnto match up with it.,That's when it really rocks, totally.,So that was on my mind.,I wanted to start that changenin the hearts and minds. 
 But two things came out of that match.,For women: self-confidence, empowerment.,They actually had enough nervento ask for a raise.,Some women have waitedn10, 15 years to ask.,I said, "More importantly,ndid you get it?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And they did!,And for the men?,A lot of the men today don't realize it,,but if you're in your 50s, 60snor whatever, late 40s,,you're the first generation of mennof the Women's Movement --,whether you like it or not! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And for the men,,what happened for the men,nthey'd come up to me --,and most times, the men are the onesnwho have tears in their eyes,,it's very interesting.,They go, "Billie, I was very youngnwhen I saw that match,,and now I have a daughter.,And I am so happy I saw thatnas a young man.",And one of those young men,nat 12 years old, was President Obama.,And he actually told me thatnwhen I met him, he said:,"You don't realize it,nbut I saw that match at 12.,And now I have two daughters,,and it has made a differencenin how I raise them.",So both men and women got a lotnout of it, but different things. 
 PM: And now there are generations --nat least one or two --,who have experienced the equality,that Title IX and other fightsnalong the way made possible.,And for women, there are generationsnwho have also experienced teamwork.,They got to play team sportsnin a way they hadn't before.,So you had a legacy already builtnin terms of being an athlete,,a legacy of the work you didnto lobby for equal pay for women athletes,and the Women's Sports Foundation.,What now are you looking to accomplish,with The Billie Jean KingnLeadership Initiative? 
 BJK: I think it goes backnto an epiphany I had at 12.,At 11, I wanted to be the number onentennis player in the world,,and a friend had asked me to playnand I said, "What's that?",Tennis was not in my family --nbasketball was, other sports.,Fast forward to 12 years old, 
 (Laughter) 
 and I'm finally startingnto play in tournaments,where you get a rankingnat the end of the year.,So I was daydreamingnat the Los Angeles Tennis Club,,and I started thinking about my sportnand how tiny it was,,but also that everybody who playednwore white shoes, white clothes,,played with white balls --neverybody who played was white.,And I said to myself, at 12 years old,n"Where is everyone else?",And that just kept sticking in my brain.,And that moment,,I promised myself I'd fightnfor equal rights and opportunities,for boys and girls, men and women,nthe rest of my life.,And that tennis, if I was fortunatenenough to become number one --,and I knew, being a girl,nit would be harder to have influence,,already at that age --,that I had this platform.,And tennis is global.,And I thought, "You know what?,I've been given an opportunitynthat very few people have had.",I didn't know if I was goingnto make it -- this was only 12.,I sure wanted it, but making itnis a whole other discussion.,I just remember I promised myself,nand I really try to keep my word.,That's who I truly am,njust fighting for people. 
 And, unfortunately, women have had less.,And we are considered less.,And so my attentions,nwhere did they have to go?,It was just ... you have to.,And learn to stick up for yourself,nhear your own voice.,You hear the same wordsnkeep coming out all the time,,and I got really luckynbecause I had an education.,And I think if you can see itnyou can be it, you know?,If you can see it, you can be it.,You look at Pat,nyou look at other leaders,,you look at these speakers,nlook at yourself,,because everyone --,everyone --,can do something extraordinary.,Every single person. 
 PM: And your story, Billie,nhas inspired so many women everywhere.,Now with the Billie Jean KingnLeadership Initiative,,you're taking on an even bigger cause.,Because one thing we hear a lotnabout is women taking their voice,,working to find their wayninto leadership positions.,But what you're talkingnabout is even bigger than that.,It's inclusive leadership.,And this is a generation that has grown upnthinking more inclusively -- 
 BJK: Isn't it great?nLook at the technology!,It's amazing how it connects us all!nIt's about connection.,It's simply amazingnwhat's possible because of it.,But the Billie Jean KingnLeadership Initiative,is really about the workforce mostly,nand trying to change it,,so people can actually go to worknand be their authentic selves. 
 Because most of us have two jobs:,One, to fit in -- I'll give youna perfect example.,An African American womanngets up an hour earlier to go to work,,straightens her hair in the bathroom,,goes to the bathroomnprobably four, five, six times a day,to keep straightening her hair,nto keep making sure she fits in.,So she's working two jobs.,She's got this other job,nwhatever that may be,,but she's also trying to fit in.,Or this poor man who kept his diploma --,he went to University of Michigan,,but he never would talk aboutnhis poverty as a youngster, ever --,just would not mention it.,So he made sure they sawnhe was well-educated.,And then you see a gay guynwho has an NFL --,which means American footballnfor all of you out there,,it's a big deal, it's very macho --,and he talked about football all the time,,because he was gaynand he didn't want anybody to know.,It just goes on and on.,So my wish for everyone is to be ablento be their authentic self 24/7,,that would be the ultimate.,And we catch ourselves -- I mean,nI catch myself to this day.,Even being gay I catch myself,nyou know, like, 
 (Gasp) 
 a little uncomfortable,na little surge in my gut,,feeling not totallyncomfortable in my own skin.,So, I think you have to ask yourself --,I want people to be themselves,nwhatever that is, just let it be. 
 PM: And the first researchnthe Leadership Initiative did showed that,,that these examples you just used --,that many of us have the problemnof being authentic.,But what you've just looked atnis this millennial generation,,who have benefited from all thesenequal opportunities --,which may not be equalnbut exist everywhere -- 
 BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.,Partnership with Teneo,na strategic company that's amazing.,That's really the reasonnI'm able to do this.,I've had two times in my life,where I've actually had mennreally behind me with power.,And that was in the old daysnwith Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,,and this is the second timenin my entire life.,And then Deloitte.,The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.,So Deloitte sent out a survey,,and over 4,000 people now have answered,,and we're continuing in the workplace. 
 And what do the millennials feel?,Well, they feel a lot, but whatnthey're so fantastic about is --,you know, our generation was like,n"Oh, we're going to get representation.",So if you walk into a room,nyou see everybody represented.,That's not good enough anymore,nwhich is so good!,So the millennials are fantastic;nthey want connection, engagement.,They just want you to tell usnwhat you're feeling, what you're thinking,,and get into the solution.,They're problem-solvers,,and of course, you've gotnthe information at your fingertips,,compared to when I was growing up. 
 PM: What did the research show younabout millennials?,Are they going to make a difference?,Are they going to create a world wherenthere is really an inclusive work force? 
 BJK: Well, in 2025,n75 percent of the global workforce,is going to be millennials.,I think they are goingnto help solve problems.,I think they haventhe wherewithal to do it.,I know they care a lot.,They have big ideasnand they can make big things happen.,I want to stay in the nownwith the young people,,I don't want to get behind. 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: I don't think there's any chance!,But what you found outnin the research about millennials,is not really the experience that a lotnof people have with millennials. 
 BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --nOK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.,I've been talking to the Boomers,nwho are their bosses, and I go,,"What do you think about the millennials?",And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,,and they get this face -- 
 (Laughter) 
 "Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I say, "Do you really think so?,Because I do think they carenabout the environment,and all these things.",And they go, "Oh, Billie,nthey cannot focus." 
 (Laughter) 
 They actually have proven 
 that the average focusnfor an 18-year-old is 37 seconds. 
 (Laughter) 
 They can't focus.,And they don't really care.,I just heard a story the other night:,a woman owns a gallerynand she has these workers.,She gets a text from one of the workers,,like an intern, she'snjust starting -- she goes,,"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be latenbecause I'm at the hairdresser's." 
 (Laughter) 
 So she arrives, and this boss says,,"What's going on?",And she says, "Oh, I was late,nsorry, how's it going?",She says, "Well, guess what?nI'd like you leave, you're finished.",She goes, "OK." 
 (Laughter) 
 No problem!,PM: Now Billie, that story --,I know, but that's whatnscares the boomers --,I'm just telling you --nso I think it's good for us to share. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, it is good for us to share,,because we're our authentic selvesnand what we're really feeling,,so we've got to take itnboth ways, you know?,But I have great faith because --,if you've been in sports like I have --,every generation gets better.,It's a fact.,With the Women's Sports Foundationnbeing the advocates for Title IX still,,because we're tryingnto keep protecting the law,,because it's in a tenuous position always,,so we really are concerned,,and we do a lot of research.,That's very important to us.,And I want to hear from people.,But we really have to protectnwhat Title IX stands for worldwide.,And you heard President Carterntalk about how Title IX is protected.,And do you know that every single lawsuit,that girls, at least in sports,nhave gone up against --,whatever institutions --,has won?,Title IX is there to protect us.,And it is amazing.,But we still have to getnthe hearts and minds --,the hearts and mindsnto match the legislation is huge. 
 PM: So what gets you up every morning?,What keeps you sustaining your work,,sustaining the fightnfor equality, extending it,,always exploring new areas,ntrying to find new ways ... ? 
 BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazynbecause I was always the curious one.,I'm highly motivated.,My younger brother wasna Major League Baseball player.,My poor parents did not carenif we were any good. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we drove them crazy because we pushed,,we pushed becausenwe wanted to be the best.,And I think it's because of whatnI'm hearing today in TED talks.,I think to listen to thesendifferent women,,to listen to different people,,to listen to President Carter --n90 years old, by the way,,and he we was throwing these figuresnout that I would never --,I'd have to go,,"Excuse me, wait a minute, I neednto get a list out of these figures.",He was rattling off --nI mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry. 
 PM: He's an amazing man. 
 (Applause) 
 BJK: And then you're going to havenPresident Mary Robinson,,who's a former president --,Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes! 
 (Applause) 
 Congress is voting in Junenon same-sex marriage,,so these are things that for some peoplenare very hard to hear.,But always remember,nevery one of us is an individual,,a human being with a beating heart,,who cares and wants to liventheir authentic life.,OK? You don't have to agree with somebody,,but everyone has the opportunity. 
 I think we all have an obligation,to continue to keep movingnthe needle forward, always.,And these people have been so inspiring.,Everyone matters.,And every one of you is an influencer.,You out there listening, out therenin the world, plus the people here --,every single person's an influencer.,Never, ever forget that. OK?,So don't ever give up on yourself. 
 PM: Billie, you have beennan inspiration for us. 
 BJK: Thanks, Pat! 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks, TED! 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks a lot!No one will ever pay younwhat you're worth.,No one will ever pay you,what you're worth.,They'll only ever pay you,what they think you're worth.,And you control their thinking,,not like this,,although that would be cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 That would be really cool.,Instead, like this:,clearly defining and communicatingnyour value are essential,to being paid well for your excellence. 
 Anyone here want to be paid well?,OK, good,,then this talk is for everyone.,It's got universal applicability.,It's true if you're a business owner,nif you're an employee,,if you're a job seeker.,It's true if you're a man or a woman. 
 Now, I approach this today throughnthe lens of the woman business owner,,because in my work I've observednthat women underprice more so than men.,The gender wage gap isna well-traveled narrative in this country.,According to the Bureaunof Labor Statistics,,a woman employee earns just 83 centsnfor every dollar a man earns.,What may surprise you,is that this trend continuesneven into the entrepreneurial sphere.,A woman business owner earns justn80 cents for every dollar a man earns.,In my work, I've often heard women express,that they're uncomfortablencommunicating their value,,especially early on in business ownership.,They say things like,,"I don't like to toot my own horn.","I'd rather let the worknspeak for itself.","I don't like to sing my own praises." 
 I hear very different narrativesnin working with male business owners,,and I think this differencenis costing women 20 cents on the dollar. 
 I'd like to tell you the storynof a consulting firm,that helps their clientsndramatically improve their profitability.,That company is my company.,After my first year in business,nI saw the profit increases,that my clients were realizingnin working with me,,and I realized that I needednto reevaluate my pricing.,I was really underpricednrelative to the value I was delivering.,It's hard for me to admit to you,nbecause I'm a pricing consultant. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's what I do.,I help companies price for value.,But nonetheless, it's what I saw,,and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing,nevaluate my value,,and I did thatnby asking key value questions.,What are my clients' needsnand how do I meet them?,What is my unique skill set that makes menbetter qualified to serve my clients?,What do I do that no one else does?,What problems do I solve for clients?,What value do I add?,I answered these questions,and defined the value that my clientsnget from working with me,,calculated their return on investment,,and what I saw wasnthat I needed to double my price,,double it.,Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.,I'm supposed to be the expert in this,nbut I'm not cured.,I knew the value was there.,I was convinced the value was there,,and I was still scared out of my wits.,What if nobody would pay me that?,What if clients said, "That's ridiculous.,You're ridiculous." 
 Was I really worth that?,Not my work, mind you, but me.,Was I worth that?,I'm the mother of two beautifulnlittle girls who depend upon me.,I'm a single mom.,What if my business fails?,What if I fail? 
 But I know how to take my own medicine,,the medicine that Inprescribe to my clients.,I had done the homework.,I knew the value was there.,So when prospects came,,I prepared the proposalsnwith the new higher pricing,and sent them out,and communicated the value.,How's the story end?,Clients continued to hire me,and refer me and recommend me,nand I'm still here.,And I share this story,because doubts and fearsnare natural and normal.,But they don't define our value,,and they shouldn't limitnour earning potential. 
 I'd like to share another story,,about a woman who learnednto communicate her value,and found her own voice.,She runs a successfulnweb development company,and employs several people.,When she first started her firmnand for several years thereafter,,she would say, "I havena little web design company.",She'd actually usenthose words with clients.,"I have a little web design company.",In this and in many other small ways,,she was diminishing her companynin the eyes of prospects and clients,,and diminishing herself.,It was really impacting her abilitynto earn what she was worth.,I believe her language and her style,communicated that she didn't believe,she had much value to offer.,In her own words, she was practicallyngiving her services away.,And so she began her journey,to take responsibilitynfor communicating value to clients,and changing her message. 
 One thing I shared with her,is that it's so important,to find your own voice,,a voice that's authentic and true to you.,Don't try to channel your sister-in-lawnjust because she's a great salesperson,or your neighbor who tells a great jokenif that's not who you are.,Give up this notionnthat it's tooting your own horn.,Make it about the other party.,Focus on serving and adding value,nand it won't feel like bragging.,What do you love about what you do?,What excites younabout the work that you do?,If you connect with that, communicatingnyour value will come naturally. 
 So she embraced her natural style,,found her voice and changed her message.,For one thing, she stopped calling herselfna little web design company.,She really found a lot of strengthnand power in communicating her message.,She's now charging three timesnas much for web design,,and her business is growing.,She told me about a recent meeting,with a gruff and sometimesndifficult client,who had called a meeting questioningnprogress on search engine optimization.,She said in the old days,,that would have beenna really intimidating meeting for her,,but her mindset was different.,She said, she prepared the information,nsat down with the client,,said this isn't about me,nit's not personal,,it's about the client.,She took them through the data,nthrough the numbers,,laid out the trends and the progressnin her own voice and in her own way,,but very directly said,n"Here's what we've done for you.",The client sat up and took notice,nand said, "OK, I got it.",And she said in describing that meeting,,"I didn't feel scared or panicky,or small,,which is how I used to feel.,Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.,I know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'" 
 Being properly valued is so important.,You can hear in this story,that the implicationsnrange far beyond just finances,into the realm of self-respectnand self-confidence.,Today I've told two stories,none about defining our value,and the other aboutncommunicating our value,,and these are the two elementsnto realizing our full earning potential.,That's the equation.,And if you're sittingnin the audience today,and you're not being paidnwhat you're worth,,I'd like to welcome youninto this equation.,Just imagine what life could be like,,how much more we could do,,how much more we could give back,,how much more we couldnplan for the future,,how validated and respected we would feel,if we could earn our full potential,,realize our full value. 
 No one will ever pay younwhat you're worth.,They'll only ever pay younwhat they think you're worth,,and you control their thinking. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I will always remember,the first time I met the girlnin the blue uniform.,I was eight at the time,,living in the village with my grandmother,,who was raising me and other children.,Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,,and we just didn't have enough to eat.,We were hungry.,And that's when the girlnin the blue uniform,came to my village with the United Nations,to feed the children. 
 As she handed me my porridge,,I asked her why she was there,,and without hesitation, she said,,"As Africans, we must upliftnall the people of Africa.",I had absolutely no idea what she meant. 
 (Laughter) 
 But her words stuck with me. 
 Two years later,,famine hit my country for the second time.,My grandmother had no choicenbut to send me to the city,to live with an auntnI had never met before.,So at the age of 10,,I found myself in schoolnfor the very first time.,And there, at the city school,,I would experiencenwhat it was to be unequal.,You see, in the village,,we were all equal.,But in the eyes and the mindsnof the other kids,,I was not their equal.,I couldn't speak English,,and I was way behindnin terms of reading and writing.,But this feeling of inequalitynwould get even more complex.,Every school holiday,spent back in the villagenwith my grandmother,made me consciously aware,of the inequalitiesnthis incredible opportunity,had created within my own family.,Suddenly, I had much morenthan the rest of my village.,And in their eyes,nI was no longer their equal. 
 I felt guilty.,But I thought about the girlnin the blue uniform,,and I remember thinking,,"That's who I want to be --,someone like her,,someone who uplifts other people.",This childhood experiencenled me to the United Nations,,and to my current role with UN Women,,where we are addressingnone of the greatest inequalities,that affects more than halfnof the world's population --,women and girls. 
 Today, I want to share with you,a simple idea that seeks to upliftnall of us together.,Eight months ago,,under the visionary leadershipnof Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,,head of UN Women,,we launched a groundbreaking initiative,called HeForShe,,inviting men and boysnfrom around the world,to stand in solidaritynwith each other and with women,,to create a shared visionnfor gender equality.,This is an invitationnfor those who believe in equality,for women and men,,and those who don't yet knownthat they believe. 
 The initiative is based on a simple idea:,that what we share is much more powerful,than what divides us.,We all feel the same things.,We all want the same things,,even when those thingsnsometimes remain unspoken.,HeForShe is about uplifting all of us,,women and men together.,It's moving us towardsnan inflection point for gender equality. 
 Imagine a blank page,with one horizontal linensplitting it in half.,Now imagine that womennare represented here,,and men are represented here.,In our current population,,HeForShe is about movingnthe 3.2 billion men,,one man at a time,,across that line,,so that ultimately,nmen can stand alongside women,and be on the right side of history,,making gender equality a realitynin the 21st century. 
 However, engaging men in the movementnwould prove quite controversial.,Why invite men? They are the problem. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, men don't care, we were told. 
 But something incredible happenednwhen we launched HeForShe.,In just three days, more than 100,000 men,had signed up and committednto be agents of change for equality.,Within that first week, at least one mannin every single country in the world,stood up to be counted,,and within that same week,,HeForShe created more thann1.2 billion conversations on social media.,And that's when the emailsnstarted pouring in,,sometimes as many as a thousand a day.,We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,,who, after hearing about HeForShe,,created a "husband school." 
 (Laughter) 
 He literally went around his village,,hand-picking all of the mennthat were abusive to their partners,,and committed to turn themninto better husbands and fathers.,In Pune, India, a youth advocatenorganized an innovative bicycle rally,,mobilizing 700 cyclists,to share the HeForShe messagesnwithin their own community. 
 In another impact story,,a man sent a very personal note,of something that had happenednin his own community.,He wrote,,"Dear Madam,,I have lived all of my life,next door to a mannwho continuously beats up his wife.,Two weeks ago,,I was listening to my radio,,and your voice came on,,and you spoke about somethingncalled the HeForShe,,and the need for men to play their role.,Within a few hours, I heardnthe woman cry again next door,,but for the first time,,I didn't just sit there.,I felt compelled to do something,,so I went overnand I confronted the husband.,Madam, it has been two weeks,,and the woman has not cried since.,Thank you for giving me a voice." 
 (Applause) 
 Personal impact stories such as these,show that we are tappingninto something within men,,but getting to a worldnwhere women and men are equal,is not just a matternof bringing men to the cause.,We want concrete, systematic,nstructural change that can equalize,the political, economicnand social realities for women and men.,We are asking mennto make concrete actions,,calling them to intervenenat a personal level,,to change their behavior.,We are calling upon governments,nbusinesses, universities,,to change their policies.,We want male leaders to become role models,and change agentsnwithin their own institutions. 
 Already, a number of prominent mennand leaders have stepped up,and made some concretenHeForShe commitments.,In a few early success stories,,a leading Frenchnhospitality company, Accor,,has committed to eliminate the pay gap,for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020. 
 (Applause) 
 The government of Sweden,,under its current feminist government,,has committed to closenboth the employment and the pay gap,for all of its citizensnwithin the current electoral term.,In Japan, the University of Nagoya,is building, as part ofntheir HeForShe commitments,,what will become one of Japan'snleading gender-research centers. 
 Now, eight months later,,a movement is building.,We are seeing men sign upnfrom every single walk of life,,and from every single corner in the world,,from the United Nations' ownnSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon,to the Secretary-Generals of NATOnand the EU Council,,from the prime minister of Bhutan,to the president of Sierra Leone. 
 In Europe alone,nall the male EU Commissioners,and the members of Parliamentnof the Swedish and Iceland governments,have signed up to be HeForShe.,In fact, one in 20 men in Icelandnhas joined the movement.,The rallying call of our passionatengoodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,,has garnered more thannfive billion media impressions,,mobilizing hundreds and thousandsnof students around the world,to create more than a hundrednHeForShe student associations. 
 Now this is the beginningnof the vision that HeForShe has,for the world that we want to see.,Einstein once said,,"A human being is part of the whole ...,but he experiences himself,,his thoughts and feelings,,as something separate from the rest ...,This delusionnis a kind of prison for us ...,Our task must bento free ourselves from this prison,by widening our circle of compassion." 
 If women and mennare part of a greater whole,,as Einstein suggests,,it is my hope that HeForShencan help free us to realize,that it is not our gender that defines us,,but ultimately, our shared humanity.,HeForShe is tappingninto women's and men's dreams,,the dreams that we have for ourselves,,and the dreams that we havenfor our families, our children,,friends, communities. 
 So that's what it is about.,HeForShe is about upliftingnall of us together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The first time I uttered a prayernwas in a glass-stained cathedral. 
 I was kneeling long afternthe congregation was on its feet, 
 dip both hands into holy water, 
 trace the trinity across my chest, 
 my tiny body drooping nlike a question mark 
 all over the wooden pew. 
 I asked Jesus to fix me, 
 and when he did not answer 
 I befriended silence in the hopesnthat my sin would burn 
 and salve my mouth,would dissolve like sugar on tongue, 
 but shame lingered as an aftertaste. 
 And in an attemptnto reintroduce me to sanctity, 
 my mother told me of the miracle I was, 
 said I could grow up nto be anything I want. 
 I decided to,be a boy. 
 It was cute. 
 I had snapback, toothless grin, 
 used skinned knees as street cred, 
 played hide and seek with nwhat was left of my goal. 
 I was it. 
 The winner to a game nthe other kids couldn't play, 
 I was the mystery of an anatomy, 
 a question asked but not answered, 
 tightroping between awkward boynand apologetic girl, 
 and when I turned 12, the boy phasenwasn't deemed cute anymore. 
 It was met with nostalgic aunts who missednseeing my knees in the shadow of skirts, 
 who reminded me that my kind of attitudenwould never bring a husband home, 
 that I exist for heterosexual marriagenand child-bearing. 
 And I swallowed their insultsnalong with their slurs. 
 Naturally, I did notncome out of the closet. 
 The kids at my school opened itnwithout my permission. 
 Called me by a name I did not recognize, 
 said "lesbian," 
 but I was more boy than girl,nmore Ken than Barbie. 
 It had nothing to do with hating my body, 
 I just love it enough to let it go, 
 I treat it like a house, 
 and when your house is falling apart, 
 you do not evacuate, 
 you make it comfortable enoughnto house all your insides, 
 you make it pretty enoughnto invite guests over, 
 you make the floorboardsnstrong enough to stand on. 
 My mother fears I have namednmyself after fading things. 
 As she counts the echoesnleft behind by Mya Hall,,Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington. 
 She fears that I'll die without a whisper, 
 that I'll turn into "what a shame"nconversations at the bus stop. 
 She claims I have turned myselfninto a mausoleum, 
 that I am a walking casket, 
 news headlines have turnednmy identity into a spectacle, 
 Bruce Jenner on everyone's lipsnwhile the brutality of living in this body 
 becomes an asterisk nat the bottom of equality pages. 
 No one ever thinks of us as human 
 because we are more ghost than flesh, 
 because people fear thatnmy gender expression is a trick, 
 that it exists to be perverse, 
 that it ensnares themnwithout their consent, 
 that my body is a feastnfor their eyes and hands 
 and once they have fed off my queer, 
 they'll regurgitate all the partsnthey did not like. 
 They'll put me back into the closet,nhang me with all the other skeletons. 
 I will be the best attraction. 
 Can you see how easy it isnto talk people into coffins, 
 to misspell their names on gravestones. 
 And people still wonder whynthere are boys rotting, 
 they go awaynin high school hallways 
 they are afraid of becoming anothernhashtag in a second 
 afraid of classroom discussionsnbecoming like judgment day 
 and now oncoming traffic is embracingnmore transgender children than parents. 
 I wonder how long it will be 
 before the trans suicide notesnstart to feel redundant, 
 before we realize that our bodiesnbecome lessons about sin 
 way before we learn how to love them. 
 Like God didn't savenall this breath and mercy, 
 like my blood is not the winenthat washed over Jesus' feet. 
 My prayers are nowngetting stuck in my throat. 
 Maybe I am finally fixed, 
 maybe I just don't care, 
 maybe God finally listened to my prayers. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)An evolutionary biologistnat Purdue University,named William Muir studied chickens.,He was interested in productivity --,I think it's somethingnthat concerns all of us --,but it's easy to measure in chickensnbecause you just count the eggs.,(Laughter),He wanted to know what could makenhis chickens more productive,,so he devised a beautiful experiment.,Chickens live in groups, so first of all,nhe selected just an average flock,,and he let it alone for six generations.,But then he created a second group,of the individuallynmost productive chickens --,you could call them superchickens --,and he put them together in a superflock,,and each generation, he selectednonly the most productive for breeding. 
 After six generations had passed,,what did he find?,Well, the first group, the average group,nwas doing just fine.,They were all plump and fully feathered,and egg productionnhad increased dramatically.,What about the second group?,Well, all but three were dead.,They'd pecked the rest to death.,(Laughter),The individually productive chickensnhad only achieved their success,by suppressing the productivitynof the rest. 
 Now, as I've gone around the worldntalking about this and telling this story,in all sorts of organizationsnand companies,,people have seennthe relevance almost instantly,,and they come up and they saynthings to me like,,"That superflock, that's my company.",(Laughter),Or, "That's my country.",Or, "That's my life." 
 All my life I've been told that the waynwe have to get ahead is to compete:,get into the right school,nget into the right job, get to the top,,and I've really never found itnvery inspiring.,I've started and run businessesnbecause invention is a joy,,and because working alongsidenbrilliant, creative people,is its own reward.,And I've never really felt very motivatednby pecking orders or by superchickens,or by superstars.,But for the past 50 years,,we've run most organizationsnand some societies,along the superchicken model.,We've thought that success is achievednby picking the superstars,,the brightest men,nor occasionally women, in the room,,and giving them all the resourcesnand all the power.,And the result has been just the samenas in William Muir's experiment:,aggression, dysfunction and waste.,If the only way the most productivencan be successful,is by suppressingnthe productivity of the rest,,then we badly need to findna better way to work,and a richer way to live.,(Applause) 
 So what is it that makes some groups,obviously more successfulnand more productive than others?,Well, that's the questionna team at MIT took to research.,They brought in hundreds of volunteers,,they put them into groups, and theyngave them very hard problems to solve.,And what happened was exactlynwhat you'd expect,,that some groups were very muchnmore successful than others,,but what was really interestingnwas that the high-achieving groups,were not those where they hadnone or two people,with spectacularly high I.Q.,Nor were the most successful groupsnthe ones that had the highest,aggregate I.Q.,Instead, they had three characteristics,nthe really successful teams.,First of all, they showed high degreesnof social sensitivity to each other.,This is measured by something callednthe Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.,It's broadly consideredna test for empathy,,and the groups that scored highly on this,did better.,Secondly, the successful groupsngave roughly equal time to each other,,so that no one voice dominated,,but neither were there any passengers.,And thirdly, the more successful groups,had more women in them.,(Applause),Now, was this because womenntypically score more highly on,the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,,so you're getting a doubling downnon the empathy quotient?,Or was it because they broughtna more diverse perspective?,We don't really know, but the strikingnthing about this experiment,is that it showed what we know, which isnsome groups do better than others,,but what's key to that,is their social connectednessnto each other. 
 So how does this play outnin the real world?,Well, it means that what happensnbetween people really counts,,because in groups that are highlynattuned and sensitive to each other,,ideas can flow and grow.,People don't get stuck.nThey don't waste energy down dead ends. 
 An example: Arup is one of the world'snmost successful engineering firms,,and it was commissioned to buildnthe equestrian center,for the Beijing Olympics.,Now, this building had to receive,two and a half thousandnreally highly strung thoroughbred horses,that were coming off long-haul flights,,highly jet-lagged,nnot feeling their finest.,And the problemnthe engineer confronted was,,what quantity of waste to cater for?,Now, you don't get taught thisnin engineering school -- (Laughter) --,and it's not really the kind of thingnyou want to get wrong,,so he could have spent monthsntalking to vets, doing the research,,tweaking the spreadsheet.,Instead, he asked for help,and he found someone who had designednthe Jockey Club in New York.,The problem was solved in less than a day.,Arup believes thatnthe culture of helpfulness,is central to their success. 
 Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,,but it's absolutely corento successful teams,,and it routinely outperformsnindividual intelligence.,Helpfulness means I don'tnhave to know everything,,I just have to work among peoplenwho are good at getting and giving help.,At SAP, they reckon that you can answernany question in 17 minutes.,But there isn't a singlenhigh-tech company I've worked with,that imagines for a momentnthat this is a technology issue,,because what drives helpfulnessnis people getting to know each other.,Now that sounds so obvious, and we thinknit'll just happen normally,,but it doesn't.,When I was runningnmy first software company,,I realized that we were getting stuck.,There was a lot of friction,nbut not much else,,and I gradually realized the brilliant,ncreative people that I'd hired,didn't know each other.,They were so focusednon their own individual work,,they didn't even knownwho they were sitting next to,,and it was only when I insistednthat we stop working,and invest time in gettingnto know each other,that we achieved real momentum. 
 Now, that was 20 years ago,nand now I visit companies,that have banned coffee cups at desks,because they want people to hang outnaround the coffee machines,and talk to each other.,The Swedes even havena special term for this.,They call it fika, which meansnmore than a coffee break.,It means collective restoration.,At Idexx, a company up in Maine,,they've created vegetable gardensnon campus so that people,from different parts of the business,can work together and get to knownthe whole business that way.,Have they all gone mad?,Quite the opposite -- they've figured outnthat when the going gets tough,,and it always will get tough,if you're doing breakthrough worknthat really matters,,what people need is social support,,and they need to know who to ask for help.,Companies don't have ideas;nonly people do.,And what motivates people,are the bonds and loyalty and trustnthey develop between each other.,What matters is the mortar,,not just the bricks. 
 Now, when you put all of this together,,what you get is somethingncalled social capital.,Social capital is the reliancenand interdependency that builds trust.,The term comes from sociologistsnwho were studying communities,that proved particularly resilientnin times of stress.,Social capital is whatngives companies momentum,,and social capitalnis what makes companies robust.,What does this mean in practical terms?,It means that time is everything,,because social capitalncompounds with time.,So teams that work together longernget better, because it takes time,to develop the trust you neednfor real candor and openness.,And time is what builds value.,When Alex Pentlandnsuggested to one company,that they synchronize coffee breaks,so that people would have timento talk to each other,,profits went up 15 million dollars,,and employee satisfactionnwent up 10 percent.,Not a bad return on social capital,,which compounds even as you spend it.,Now, this isn't about chumminess,nand it's no charter for slackers,,because people who work this wayntend to be kind of scratchy,,impatient, absolutely determinednto think for themselves,because that's what their contribution is.,Conflict is frequentnbecause candor is safe.,And that's how good ideasnturn into great ideas,,because no idea is born fully formed.,It emerges a little bitnas a child is born,,kind of messy and confused,nbut full of possibilities.,And it's only through the generousncontribution, faith and challenge,that they achieve their potential.,And that's what social capital supports. 
 Now, we aren't really usednto talking about this,,about talent, about creativity,nin this way.,We're used to talking about stars.,So I started to wonder,nwell, if we start working this way,,does that mean no more stars?,So I went and I sat in on the auditions,at the Royal Academynof Dramatic Art in London.,And what I saw there really surprised me,,because the teachers weren't lookingnfor individual pyrotechnics.,They were looking for what happenednbetween the students,,because that's where the drama is.,And when I talkednto producers of hit albums,,they said, "Oh sure, we havenlots of superstars in music.,It's just, they don't last very long.,It's the outstanding collaboratorsnwho enjoy the long careers,,because bringing out the best in othersnis how they found the best,in themselves.",And when I went to visit companiesnthat are renowned,for their ingenuity and creativity,,I couldn't even see any superstars,,because everybody there really mattered.,And when I reflected on my own career,,and the extraordinary peoplenI've had the privilege to work with,,I realized how much morenwe could give each other,if we just stopped tryingnto be superchickens.,(Laughter) (Applause),Once you appreciatentruly how social work is,,a lot of things have to change.,Management by talent contestnhas routinely pitted,employees against each other.,Now, rivalry has to be replacednby social capital.,For decades, we've triednto motivate people with money,,even though we've gotna vast amount of research that shows,that money erodes social connectedness.,Now, we need to let peoplenmotivate each other.,And for years, we've thought that leadersnwere heroic soloists who were expected,,all by themselves,nto solve complex problems.,Now, we need to redefine leadership,as an activity in whichnconditions are created,in which everyone can do their mostncourageous thinking together. 
 We know that this works.,When the Montreal Protocol callednfor the phasing out of CFCs,,the chlorofluorocarbons implicatednin the hole in the ozone layer,,the risks were immense.,CFCs were everywhere,,and nobody knew if a substitutencould be found.,But one team that rose to the challengenadopted three key principles.,The first was the head of engineering,nFrank Maslen, said,,there will be no stars in this team.,We need everybody.,Everybody has a valid perspective.,Second, we work to one standard only:,the best imaginable.,And third, he told his boss,nGeoff Tudhope,,that he had to butt out,,because he knewnhow disruptive power can be.,Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.,He gave the team air cover,,and he listened to ensurenthat they honored their principles.,And it worked: Ahead of all the otherncompanies tackling this hard problem,,this group cracked it first.,And to date, the Montreal Protocol,is the most successful internationalnenvironmental agreement,ever implemented. 
 There was a lot at stake then,,and there's a lot at stake now,,and we won't solve our problemsnif we expect it to be solved,by a few supermen or superwomen.,Now we need everybody,,because it is only when we acceptnthat everybody has value,that we will liberate the energynand imagination and momentum we need,to create the best beyond measure. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, people are more afraid of insectsnthan they are of dying.,(Laughter),At least, according to a 1973n"Book of Lists" survey,which preceded all those online best,nworst, funniest lists that you see today.,Only heights and public speaking,exceeded the six-leggednas sources of fear.,And I suspect if you had putnspiders in there,,the combinations of insects and spidersnwould have just topped the chart.,Now, I am not one of those people.,I really love insects.,I think they're interesting and beautiful,,and sometimes even cute.,(Laughter),And I'm not alone.,For centuries, somenof the greatest minds in science,,from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,,have drawn inspiration from studyingnsome of the smallest minds on Earth.,Well, why is that?,What is that keeps usncoming back to insects?,Some of it, of course, is just the sheernmagnitude of almost everything about them.,They're more numerousnthan any other kind of animal.,We don't even know how many speciesnof insects there are,,because new onesnare being discovered all the time.,There are at least a million,nmaybe as many as 10 million.,This means that you could havenan insect-of-the-month calendar,and not have to reuse a speciesnfor over 80,000 years.,(Laughter),Take that, pandas and kittens!,(Laughter) 
 More seriously, insects are essential.,We need them.,It's been estimatednthat 1 out of every 3 bites of food,is made possible by a pollinator.,Scientist use insects to make fundamentalndiscoveries,about everything from the structurenof our nervous systems,to how our genes and DNA work.,But what I love most about insects,is what they can tell usnabout our own behavior.,Insects seem like they doneverything that people do.,They meet, they mate,nthey fight, they break up.,And they do so with what looksnlike love or animosity.,But what drives their behaviors is reallyndifferent than what drives our own,,and that differencencan be really illuminating.,There's nowhere where that's more true,than when it comes to onenof our most consuming interests -- sex. 
 Now, I will maintain.nand I think I can defend,,what may seem like a surprising statement.,I think sex in insects is moreninteresting than sex in people.,(Laughter),And the wild variety that we see,makes us challengensome of our own assumptions,about what it means to be male and female.,Of course, to start with,,a lot of insects don't neednto have sex at all to reproduce.,Female aphids can make little, tiny clonesnof themselves without ever mating.,Virgin birth, right there.,On your rose bushes.,(Laughter),When they do have sex,,even their sperm is moreninteresting than human sperm.,There are some kinds of fruit flies,whose sperm is longernthan the male's own body.,And that's important because the malesnuse their sperm to compete.,Now, male insects do compete with weapons,nlike the horns on these beetles.,But they also competenafter mating with their sperm.,Dragonflies and damselflies have penisesnthat look kind of like Swiss Army knives,with all of the attachments pulled out.,(Laughter),They use these formidable devicesnlike scoops,,to remove the sperm from previous malesnthat the female has mated with.,(Laughter),So, what can we learn from this?,(Laughter),All right, it is not a lesson in the sensenof us imitating them,or of them settingnan example for us to follow.,Which, given this,nis probably just as well.,And also, did I mention sexual cannibalismnis rampant among insects?,So, no, that's not the point.,But what I think insects do,,is break a lot of the rulesnthat we humans have about the sex roles.,So, people have this idea that naturendictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version,of what males and females are like.,So that males are alwaysnsupposed to be dominant and aggressive,,and females are passive and coy. 
 But that's just not the case.,So for example, take katydids,,which are relatives of cricketsnand grasshoppers.,The males are very pickynabout who they mate with,,because they not only transfernsperm during mating,,they also give the femalensomething called a nuptial gift.,You can see two katydidsnmating in these photos.,In both panels,nthe male's the one on the right,,and that sword-like appendagenis the female's egg-laying organ.,The white blob is the sperm,,the green blob is the nuptial gift,,and the male manufacturesnthis from his own body,and it's extremely costly to produce.,It can weigh up to a thirdnof his body mass.,I will now pause for a momentnand let you think about,what it would be like if human men,nevery time they had sex,,had to produce somethingnthat weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.,(Laughter),Okay, they would not be ablento do that very often.,(Laughter),And indeed, neither can the katydids.,And so what that means,is the katydid males are very choosy,about who they offernthese nuptial gifts to.,Now, the gift is very nutritious,,and the female eats itnduring and after mating.,So, the bigger it is,nthe better off the male is,,because that means more time for his sperm,to drain into her bodynand fertilize her eggs.,But it also means that the malesnare very passive about mating,,whereas the femalesnare extremely aggressive and competitive,,in an attempt to get as many of thesennutritious nuptial gifts as they can.,So, it's not exactlyna stereotypical set of rules.,Even more generally though,,males are actually not all that importantnin the lives of a lot of insects.,In the social insects --nthe bees and wasps and ants --,the individuals that you see every day --,the ants going back and forthnto your sugar bowl,,the honey bees that are flittingnfrom flower to flower --,all of those are always female.,People have had a hard time gettingntheir head around that idea for millennia.,The ancient Greeks knew that there wasna class of bees, the drones,,that are larger than the workers,,although they disapprovednof the drones' laziness,because they could see thatnthe drones just hang around the hive,until the mating flight --,they're the males.,They hang around until the mating flight,,but they don't participatenin gathering nectar or pollen.,The Greeks couldn't figure outnthe drones' sex,,and part of the confusion was that theynwere aware of the stinging ability of bees,but they found it difficult to believe,that any animals that bore such a weaponncould possibly be a female.,Aristotle tried to get involved as well.,He suggested, "OK, if the stingingnindividuals are going to be the males ...",Then he got confused,nbecause that would have meant,the males were also taking carenof the young in a colony,,and he seemed to thinknthat would be completely impossible.,He then concluded that maybenbees had the organs of both sexes,in the same individual,,which is not that far-fetched,nsome animals do that,,but he never reallyndid get it figured out.,And you know, even today,nmy students, for instance,,call every animal they see,nincluding insects, a male.,And when I tell themnthat the ferocious army-ant soldiers,with their giant jaws,nused to defend the colony,,are all always female,,they seem to not quite believe me.,(Laughter),And certainly all of the movies --nAntz, Bee Movie --,portray the main characternin the social insects as being male.,Well, what difference does this make?,These are movies. They're fiction.,They have talking animals in them.,What difference does it makenif they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?,I think it does matter,,and it's a problem that actuallynis part of a much deeper one,that has implicationsnfor medicine and health,and a lot of other aspects of our lives.,You all know that scientistsnuse what we call model systems,,which are creatures --nwhite rats or fruit flies --,that are kind of stand-insnfor all other animals, including people.,And the idea isnthat what's true for a person,will also be true for the white rat.,And by and large,nthat turns out to be the case.,But you can take the ideanof a model system too far.,And what I think we've done,,is use males, in any species,nas though they are the model system.,The norm.,The way things are supposed to be.,And females as a kind of variant --,something special that you only studynafter you get the basics down.,And so, back to the insects.,I think what that means,is that people just couldn't seenwhat was in front of them.,Because they assumed that the world'snstage was largely occupied by male players,and females would only havenminor, walk-on roles.,But when we do that, we really miss outnon a lot of what nature is like.,And we can also miss out on the waynnatural, living things, including people,,can vary.,And I think that's why we've used malesnas models in a lot of medical research,,something that we know now to be a problem,if we want the results to applynto both men and women.,Well, the last thingnI really love about insects,is something that a lot of peoplenfind unnerving about them.,They have little, tiny brains,with very little cognitive ability,nthe way we normally think of it.,They have complicated behavior,nbut they lack complicated brains.,And so, we can't just think of themnas though they're little people,because they don't do thingsnthe way that we do.,I really love that it's difficultnto anthropomorphize insects,,to look at them and just think of themnlike they're little people,in exoskeletons, with six legs.,(Laughter),Instead, you really have to accept themnon their own terms,,because insects make us questionnwhat's normal and what's natural.,Now, you know, people write fictionnand talk about parallel universes.,They speculate about the supernatural,,maybe the spirits of the departednwalking among us.,The allure of another world,is something that people say is part ofnwhy they want to dabble in the paranormal.,But as far as I'm concerned,,who needs to be able to see dead people,,when you can see live insects?,Thank you.,(Applause)A question I'm often asked is,,where did I get my passionnfor human rights and justice?,It started early.,I grew up in the west of Ireland,,wedged between four brothers,,two older than me and two younger than me.,So of course I had to beninterested in human rights,,and equality and justice,,and using my elbows! 
 (Laughter) 
 And those issues stayednwith me and guided me,,and in particular,,when I was elected the firstnwoman President of Ireland,,from 1990 to 1997.,I dedicated my presidency,to having a space for those who feltnmarginalized on the island of Ireland,,and bringing together communitiesnfrom Northern Ireland,with those from the Republic,,trying to build peace.,And I went as the first Irish presidentnto the United Kingdom,and met with Queen Elizabeth II,,and also welcomed to mynofficial residence --,which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin,"nthe house of the president --,members of the royal family,,including, notably, the Prince of Wales.,And I was aware that at the timenof my presidency,,Ireland was a country beginningna rapid economic progress.,We were a country that was benefitingnfrom the solidarity of the European Union.,Indeed, when Ireland first joinednthe European Union in 1973,,there were parts of the countrynthat were considered developing,,including my own belovednnative county, County Mayo.,I led trade delegationsnhere to the United States,,to Japan, to India,,to encourage investment,nto help to create jobs,,to build up our economy,,to build up our health system,nour education --,our development. 
 What I didn't have to do as president,was buy land on mainland Europe,,so that Irish citizens could go therenbecause our island was going underwater.,What I didn't have to think about,,either as presidentnor as a constitutional lawyer,,was the implicationsnfor the sovereignty of the territory,because of the impact of climate change.,But that is what President Tong,nof the Republic of Kiribati,,has to wake up every morningnthinking about.,He has bought land in Fijinas an insurance policy,,what he calls, "migration with dignity,",because he knows that his peoplenmay have to leave their islands.,As I listened to President Tongndescribing the situation,,I really felt that this was a problemnthat no leader should have to face.,And as I heard him speaknabout the pain of his problems,,I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.,I thought about hernand those who worked with her,on the Commission on Human Rights,nwhich she chaired in 1948,,and drew up the UniversalnDeclaration of Human Rights.,For them, it would have been unimaginable,that a whole countryncould go out of existence,because of human-induced climate change. 
 I came to climate change not asna scientist or an environmental lawyer,,and I wasn't really impressednby the images of polar bears,or melting glaciers.,It was because of the impact on people,,and the impact on their rights --,their rights to food and safe water,nhealth, education and shelter.,And I say this with humility,,because I came latento the issue of climate change.,When I served,as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,from 1997 to 2002,,climate change wasn'tnat the front of my mind.,I don't remember makingna single speech on climate change.,I knew that there was anothernpart of the United Nations --,the UN Convention on Climate Change --,that was dealing withnthe issue of climate change.,It was later when I startednto work in African countries,on issues of development and human rights.,And I kept hearingnthis pervasive sentence:,"Oh, but things are so much worse now,nthings are so much worse.",And then I explored what was behind that;,it was about changes in the climate --,climate shocks, changes in the weather. 
 I met Constance Okollet,,who had formed a women's groupnin Eastern Uganda,,and she told me thatnwhen she was growing up,,she had a very normal life in her villagenand they didn't go hungry,,they knew that the seasons would comenas they were predicted to come,,they knew when to sownand they knew when to harvest,,and so they had enough food.,But, in recent years,,at the time of this conversation,,they had nothingnbut long periods of drought,,and then flash flooding,,and then more drought.,The school had been destroyed,,livelihoods had been destroyed,,their harvest had been destroyed.,She forms this women's groupnto try to keep her community together.,And this was a realitynthat really struck me,,because of course,nConstance Okollet wasn't responsible,for the greenhouse gas emissionsnthat were causing this problem. 
 Indeed, I was very strucknabout the situation in Malawi,in January of this year.,There was an unprecedentednflooding in the country,,it covered about a third of the country,,over 300 people were killed,,and hundreds of thousandsnlost their livelihoods.,And the average person in Malawi,emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.,The average US citizen emitsnabout 17.5 metric tons.,So those who are sufferingndisproportionately,don't drive cars, don't have electricity,ndon't consume very significantly,,and yet they are feeling more and more,the impacts of the changes in the climate,,the changes that are preventing themnfrom knowing how to grow food properly,,and knowing hownto look after their future.,I think it was reallynthe importance of the injustice,that really struck me very forcibly. 
 And I know that we're not ablento address some of that injustice,because we're not on coursenfor a safe world.,Governments around the world agreednat the conference in Copenhagen,,and have repeated itnat every conference on climate,,that we have to staynbelow two degrees Celsius,of warming above pre-Industrial standards.,But we're on coursenfor about four degrees.,So we face an existential threatnto the future of our planet.,And that made me realize,that climate change is the greatest threatnto human rights in the 21st century. 
 And that brought me thennto climate justice.,Climate justice respondsnto the moral argument --,both sides of the moral argument --,to address climate change.,First of all,,to be on the side of those who arensuffering most and are most effected.,And secondly,,to make sure that they're not left behindnagain, when we start to move,and start to address climate changenwith climate action,,as we are doing. 
 In our very unequal world today,,it's very striking how manynpeople are left behind.,In our world of 7.2 billion people,nabout 3 billion are left behind.,1.3 billion don't have accessnto electricity,,and they light their homesnwith kerosene and candles,,both of which are dangerous.,And in fact they spend a lot of theirntiny income on that form of lighting.,2.6 billion people cook on open fires --,on coal, wood and animal dung.,And this causesnabout 4 million deaths a year,from indoor smoke inhalation,,and of course, most of thosenwho die are women.,So we have a very unequal world,,and we need to changenfrom "business as usual.",And we shouldn't underestimatenthe scale and the transformative nature,of the change which will be needed,,because we have to go to zeroncarbon emissions by about 2050,,if we're going to stay belowntwo degrees Celsius of warming.,And that means we have to leavenabout two-thirds of the known resources,of fossil fuels in the ground. 
 It's a very big change,,and it means that obviously,,industrialized countriesnmust cut their emissions,,must become much more energy-efficient,,and must move as quickly as possiblento renewable energy.,For developing countriesnand emerging economies,,the problem and the challengenis to grow without emissions,,because they must develop;nthey have very poor populations.,So they must develop without emissions,nand that is a different kind of problem.,Indeed, no country in the worldnhas actually grown without emissions.,All the countries have developednwith fossil fuels,,and then may be movingnto renewable energy.,So it is a very big challenge,,and it requires the total supportnof the international community,,with the necessary finance and technology,nand systems and support,,because no country can make itself safenfrom the dangers of climate change.,This is an issue that requiresncomplete human solidarity.,Human solidarity, if you like,nbased on self-interest --,because we are all in this together,,and we have to work together,to ensure that we reachnzero carbon by 2050. 
 The good news is that change is happening,,and it's happening very fast.,Here in California,,there's a very ambitiousnemissions target to cut emissions.,In Hawaii, they're passing legislation,to have 100 percentnrenewable energy by 2045.,And governments are very ambitiousnaround the world.,In Costa Rica, they have committednto being carbon-neutral by 2021.,In Ethiopia, the commitmentnis to be carbon-neutral by 2027.,Apple have pledged that their factoriesnin China will use renewable energy.,And there is a race on at the moment,to convert electricitynfrom tidal and wave power,,in order that we can leaventhe coal in the ground.,And that change is both welcomenand is happening very rapidly.,But it's still not enough,,and the political willnis still not enough. 
 Let me come back to President Tongnand his people in Kiribati.,They actually could be able to livenon their island and have a solution,,but it would take a lot of political will.,President Tong told menabout his ambitious idea,to either build up or even floatnthe little islands where his people live.,This, of course, is beyondnthe resources of Kiribati itself.,It would require great solidaritynand support from other countries,,and it would requirenthe kind of imaginative idea,that we bring together when we wantnto have a space station in the air.,But wouldn't it be wonderfulnto have this engineering wonder,and to allow a people to remainnin their sovereign territory,,and be part of the community of nations?,That is the kind of ideanthat we should be thinking about.,Yes, the challengesnof the transformation we need are big,,but they can be solved.,We are actually, as a people,,very capable of coming togethernto solve problems. 
 I was very conscious of thisnas I took part this year,in commemoration of the 70th anniversary,of the end of the SecondnWorld War in 1945.,1945 was an extraordinary year.,It was a year when the world faced,what must have seemed almostninsoluble problems --,the devastation of the world wars,nparticularly the Second World War;,the fragile peace that hadnbeen brought about;,the need for a wholeneconomic regeneration.,But the leaders of that timendidn't flinch from this.,They had the capacity, they hadna sense of being driven by,never again must the worldnhave this kind of problem.,And they had to build structuresnfor peace and security.,And what did we get?nWhat did they achieve?,The Charter of the United Nations,,the Bretton Woods institutions,nas they're called, The World Bank,,and the International Monetary Fund.,A Marshall Plan for Europe,na devastated Europe,,to reconstruct it.,And indeed a few years later,,the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
 2015 is a year that is similarnin its importance,to 1945, with similar challengesnand similar potential.,There will be two big summits this year:,the first one, in September in New York,,is the summit for the sustainablendevelopment goals.,And then the summit in Paris in December,nto give us a climate agreement.,The sustainable development goalsnare intended to help countries,to live sustainably,nin tune with Mother Earth,,not to take out of Mother Earthnand destroy ecosystems,,but rather, to live in harmonynwith Mother Earth,,by living under sustainable development.,And the sustainable development goals,will come into operation for all countries,on January 1, 2016.,The climate agreement --,a binding climate agreement --,is needed becausenof the scientific evidence,that we're on a trajectorynfor about a four-degree world,and we have to change coursento stay below two degrees.,So we need to take stepsnthat will be monitored and reviewed,,so that we can keep increasingnthe ambition of how we cut emissions,,and how we move more rapidlynto renewable energy,,so that we have a safe world. 
 The reality is that this issuenis much too important,to be left to politiciansnand to the United Nations. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's an issue for all of us,,and it's an issue where we neednmore and more momentum.,Indeed, the face ofnthe environmentalist has changed,,because of the justice dimension.,It's now an issuenfor faith-based organizations,,under very good leadershipnfrom Pope Francis,,and indeed, the Church of England,,which is divesting from fossil fuels.,It's an issue for the business community,,and the good news is,that the business communitynis changing very rapidly --,except for the fossil fuel industries -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Even they are beginningnto slightly change their language --,but only slightly.,But business is not only moving rapidlynto the benefits of renewable energy,,but is urging politiciansnto give them more signals,,so that they can move even more rapidly.,It's an issue for the tradenunion movement.,It's an issue for the women's movement.,It's an issue for young people. 
 I was very struck when I learnednthat Jibreel Khazan,,one of the Greensboro Four who hadntaken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,,said quite recently that,climate change is the lunch counternmoment for young people.,So, lunch counter momentnfor young people of the 21st century --,the sort of real human rights issuenof the 21st century,,because he said it isnthe greatest challenge,to humanity and justice in our world. 
 I recall very muchnthe Climate March last September,,and that was a huge momentum,,not just in New York,nbut all around the world.,and we have to build on that.,I was marching with somenof The Elders family,,and I saw a placardna little bit away from me,,but we were wedged so closely together --,because after all, there were 400,000npeople out in the streets of New York --,so I couldn't quite get to that placard,,I would have just liked to have beennable to step behind it,,because it said, "Angry Grannies!" 
 (Laughter) 
 That's what I felt.,And I have five grandchildren now,,I feel very happy as an Irish grandmothernto have five grandchildren,,and I think about their world,,and what it will benlike when they will share that world,with about 9 billion other people in 2050.,We know that inevitably it willnbe a climate-constrained world,,because of the emissionsnwe've already put up there,,but it could be a world that is muchnmore equal and much fairer,,and much better for health,nand better for jobs,and better for energy security,,than the world we have now,,if we have switched sufficientlynand early enough to renewable energy,,and no one is left behind.,No one is left behind. 
 And just as we've beennlooking back this year --,in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --,I would like to thinknthat they will look back,,that world will look backn35 years from 2050,,35 years to 2015,,and that they will say,,"Weren't they goodnto do what they did in 2015?,We really appreciate that they tooknthe decisions that made a difference,,and that put the worldnon the right pathway,,and we benefit now from that pathway,",that they will feel that somehownwe took our responsibilities,,we did what was donenin 1945 in similar terms,,we didn't miss the opportunity,,we lived up to our responsibilities.,That's what this year is about. 
 And somehow for me,,it's captured in words of somebodynthat I admired very much.,She was a mentor of mine,nshe was a friend,,she died much too young,,she was an extraordinary personality,,a great champion of the environment:,Wangari Maathai.,Wangari said once,,"In the course of history,,there comes a timenwhen humanity is called upon,to shift to a new level of consciousness,,to reach a higher moral ground.",And that's what we have to do.,We have to reachna new level of consciousness,,a higher moral ground.,And we have to do it this yearnin those two big summits.,And that won't happen unlessnwe have the momentum,from people around the world who say:,"We want action now,,we want to change course,,we want a safe world,,a safe world for future generations,,a safe world for our childrennand our grandchildren,,and we're all in this together." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Our emotions influencenevery aspect of our lives,,from our health and how we learn,nto how we do business and make decisions,,big ones and small.,Our emotions also influencenhow we connect with one another.,We've evolved to livenin a world like this,,but instead, we're livingnmore and more of our lives like this --,this is the text messagenfrom my daughter last night --,in a world that's devoid of emotion.,So I'm on a mission to change that.,I want to bring emotionsnback into our digital experiences. 
 I started on this path 15 years ago.,I was a computer scientist in Egypt,,and I had just gotten accepted tona Ph.D. program at Cambridge University.,So I did something quite unusual,for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife:,With the support of my husband,nwho had to stay in Egypt,,I packed my bags and I moved to England.,At Cambridge, thousands of milesnaway from home,,I realized I was spendingnmore hours with my laptop,than I did with any other human.,Yet despite this intimacy, my laptopnhad absolutely no idea how I was feeling.,It had no idea if I was happy,,having a bad day, or stressed, confused,,and so that got frustrating.,Even worse, as I communicatednonline with my family back home,,I felt that all my emotionsndisappeared in cyberspace.,I was homesick, I was lonely,nand on some days I was actually crying,,but all I had to communicatenthese emotions was this.,(Laughter),Today's technologynhas lots of I.Q., but no E.Q.;,lots of cognitive intelligence,nbut no emotional intelligence.,So that got me thinking,,what if our technologyncould sense our emotions?,What if our devices could sensenhow we felt and reacted accordingly,,just the way an emotionallynintelligent friend would?,Those questions led me and my team,to create technologies that can readnand respond to our emotions,,and our starting point was the human face. 
 So our human face happens to benone of the most powerful channels,that we all use to communicatensocial and emotional states,,everything from enjoyment, surprise,,empathy and curiosity.,In emotion science, we call eachnfacial muscle movement an action unit.,So for example, action unit 12,,it's not a Hollywood blockbuster,,it is actually a lip corner pull,nwhich is the main component of a smile.,Try it everybody. Let's getnsome smiles going on.,Another example is action unit 4.nIt's the brow furrow.,It's when you draw your eyebrows together,and you create allnthese textures and wrinkles.,We don't like them, but it'sna strong indicator of a negative emotion.,So we have about 45 of these action units,,and they combine to expressnhundreds of emotions. 
 Teaching a computer to readnthese facial emotions is hard,,because these action units,nthey can be fast, they're subtle,,and they combine in many different ways.,So take, for example,nthe smile and the smirk.,They look somewhat similar,nbut they mean very different things.,(Laughter),So the smile is positive,,a smirk is often negative.,Sometimes a smirkncan make you become famous.,But seriously, it's importantnfor a computer to be able,to tell the differencenbetween the two expressions. 
 So how do we do that?,We give our algorithms,tens of thousands of examplesnof people we know to be smiling,,from different ethnicities, ages, genders,,and we do the same for smirks.,And then, using deep learning,,the algorithm looks for all thesentextures and wrinkles,and shape changes on our face,,and basically learns that all smilesnhave common characteristics,,all smirks have subtlyndifferent characteristics.,And the next time it sees a new face,,it essentially learns that,this face has the samencharacteristics of a smile,,and it says, "Aha, I recognize this.nThis is a smile expression." 
 So the best way to demonstratenhow this technology works,is to try a live demo,,so I need a volunteer,npreferably somebody with a face.,(Laughter),Cloe's going to be our volunteer today. 
 So over the past five years, we've movednfrom being a research project at MIT,to a company,,where my team has worked really hardnto make this technology work,,as we like to say, in the wild.,And we've also shrunk it so thatnthe core emotion engine,works on any mobile devicenwith a camera, like this iPad.,So let's give this a try. 
 As you can see, the algorithmnhas essentially found Cloe's face,,so it's this white bounding box,,and it's tracking the mainnfeature points on her face,,so her eyebrows, her eyes,nher mouth and her nose.,The question is,ncan it recognize her expression?,So we're going to test the machine.,So first of all, give me your poker face.nYep, awesome. (Laughter),And then as she smiles,nthis is a genuine smile, it's great.,So you can see the green barngo up as she smiles.,Now that was a big smile.,Can you try a subtle smilento see if the computer can recognize?,It does recognize subtle smiles as well.,We've worked really hardnto make that happen.,And then eyebrow raised,nindicator of surprise.,Brow furrow, which isnan indicator of confusion.,Frown. Yes, perfect.,So these are all the differentnaction units. There's many more of them.,This is just a slimmed-down demo.,But we call each readingnan emotion data point,,and then they can fire togethernto portray different emotions.,So on the right side of the demo --nlook like you're happy.,So that's joy. Joy fires up.,And then give me a disgust face.,Try to remember what it was likenwhen Zayn left One Direction.,(Laughter),Yeah, wrinkle your nose. Awesome.,And the valence is actually quitennegative, so you must have been a big fan.,So valence is how positivenor negative an experience is,,and engagement is hownexpressive she is as well.,So imagine if Cloe had accessnto this real-time emotion stream,,and she could share itnwith anybody she wanted to.,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 So, so far, we have amassedn12 billion of these emotion data points.,It's the largest emotionndatabase in the world.,We've collected itnfrom 2.9 million face videos,,people who have agreednto share their emotions with us,,and from 75 countries around the world.,It's growing every day.,It blows my mind away,that we can now quantify somethingnas personal as our emotions,,and we can do it at this scale. 
 So what have we learned to date?,Gender.,Our data confirms somethingnthat you might suspect.,Women are more expressive than men.,Not only do they smile more,ntheir smiles last longer,,and we can now really quantifynwhat it is that men and women,respond to differently.,Let's do culture: So in the United States,,women are 40 percentnmore expressive than men,,but curiously, we don't see any differencenin the U.K. between men and women.,(Laughter),Age: People who are 50 years and older,are 25 percent more emotiventhan younger people.,Women in their 20s smile a lot morenthan men the same age,,perhaps a necessity for dating.,But perhaps what surprised usnthe most about this data,is that we happennto be expressive all the time,,even when we are sittingnin front of our devices alone,,and it's not just when we're watchingncat videos on Facebook.,We are expressive when we're emailing,ntexting, shopping online,,or even doing our taxes. 
 Where is this data used today?,In understanding how we engage with media,,so understanding viralitynand voting behavior;,and also empoweringnor emotion-enabling technology,,and I want to share some examplesnthat are especially close to my heart.,Emotion-enabled wearable glassesncan help individuals,who are visually impairednread the faces of others,,and it can help individualsnon the autism spectrum interpret emotion,,something that they really struggle with.,In education, imaginenif your learning apps,sense that you're confused and slow down,,or that you're bored, so it's sped up,,just like a great teachernwould in a classroom.,What if your wristwatch tracked your mood,,or your car sensed that you're tired,,or perhaps your fridgenknows that you're stressed,,so it auto-locks to prevent younfrom binge eating. (Laughter),I would like that, yeah.,What if, when I was in Cambridge,,I had access to my real-timenemotion stream,,and I could share that with my familynback home in a very natural way,,just like I would've if we were allnin the same room together? 
 I think five years down the line,,all our devices are goingnto have an emotion chip,,and we won't remember what it was likenwhen we couldn't just frown at our device,and our device would say, "Hmm,nyou didn't like that, did you?",Our biggest challenge is that there arenso many applications of this technology,,my team and I realize that we can'tnbuild them all ourselves,,so we've made this technology availablenso that other developers,can get building and get creative.,We recognize thatnthere are potential risks,and potential for abuse,,but personally, having spentnmany years doing this,,I believe that the benefits to humanity,from having emotionallynintelligent technology,far outweigh the potential for misuse.,And I invite you all to benpart of the conversation.,The more people who knownabout this technology,,the more we can all have a voicenin how it's being used.,So as more and morenof our lives become digital,,we are fighting a losing battlentrying to curb our usage of devices,in order to reclaim our emotions.,So what I'm trying to do insteadnis to bring emotions into our technology,and make our technologies more responsive.,So I want those devicesnthat have separated us,to bring us back together.,And by humanizing technology,nwe have this golden opportunity,to reimagine how wenconnect with machines,,and therefore, how we, as human beings,,connect with one another. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine a place where your neighborsngreet your children by name;,a place with splendid vistas;,a place where you can drivenjust 20 minutes,and put your sailboat on the water.,It's a seductive place, isn't it? 
 I don't live there.,(Laughter),But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip,for two years, to the fastest-growingnand whitest counties in America. 
 What is a Whitopia?,I define Whitopia in three ways:,First, a Whitopia has posted at leastnsix percent population growth since 2000.,Secondly, the majority of that growthncomes from white migrants.,And third, the Whitopianhas an ineffable charm,,a pleasant look and feel,,a je Ne sais quoi.,(Laughter) 
 To learn how and whynWhitopias are ticking,,I immersed myself for several monthsnapiece in three of them:,first, St. George, Utah;,second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;,and third, Forsyth County, Georgia. 
 First stop, St. George --na beautiful town of red rock landscapes.,In the 1850s, Brigham Youngndispatched families to St. George,to grow cotton becausenof the hot, arid climate.,And so they called it Utah's Dixie,nand the name sticks to this day.,I approached my time in each Whitopianlike an anthropologist.,I made detailed spreadsheets of allnthe power brokers in the communities,,who I needed to meet,nwhere I needed to be,,and I threw myself with gustonin these communities.,I went to zoning board meetings,,I went to Democratic clubsnand Republican clubs.,I went to poker nights.,In St. George, I rentedna home at the Entrada,,one of the town'snpremier gated communities.,There were no Motel 6'snor Howard Johnsons for me.,I lived in Whitopia as a resident,nand not like a visitor. 
 I rented myself this home by phone.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Golf is the perfect seductivensymbol of Whitopia.,When I went on my journey,,I had barely ever held a golf club.,By the time I left, I was golfingnat least three times a week.,(Laughter) 
 Golf helps people bond.,Some of the best interviews I ever scorednduring my trip were on the golf courses.,One venture capitalist, for example,ninvited me to golf in his private club,that had no minority members. 
 I also went fishing.,(Laughter),Because I had never fished,nthis fellow had to teach me,how to cast my line and what bait to use. 
 I also played poker every weekend.,It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.,My poker mates may have been bluffingnabout the hands that they drew,,but they weren't bluffingnabout their social beliefs.,Some of the most raw,nsalty conversations I ever had,during my journey were at the poker table. 
 I'm a gung ho entertainer.,I love to cook, I hostednmany dinner parties, and in return,,people invited me to their dinner parties,,and to their barbecues,nand to their pool parties,,and to their birthday parties. 
 But it wasn't all fun.,Immigration turned out to bena big issue in this Whitopia.,The St. George's Citizens Councilnon Illegal Immigration,held regular and active protestsnagainst immigration,,and so what I gleaned from this Whitopianis what a hot debate this would become.,It was a real-time preview,nand so it has become. 
 Next stop: Almost Heaven,na cabin I rented for myself,in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautifulnNorth Idaho panhandle.,I rented this placenfor myself, also by phone.,(Laughter) 
 The book "A Thousand Places To SeenBefore You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene --,it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen,nboatmen and fishermen. 
 My growing golf skillsncame in handy in Coeur d'Alene.,I golfed with retired LAPD cops.,In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops,fled Los Angelesnafter the L.A. racial unrest,,for North Idaho, and they've builtnan expatriated community.,Given the conservatism of these cops,,there's no surprise that North Idahonhas a strong gun culture.,In fact, it is said, North Idahonhas more gun dealers than gas stations.,So what's a resident to do to fit in?,I hit the gun club.,When I rented a gun,nthe gentleman behind the counter,was perfectly pleasant and kind,,until I showed himnmy New York City driver's license.,That's when he got nervous.,I'm not as bad a shotnas I thought I might have been. 
 What I learned from North Idahonis the peculiar brand of paranoia,that can permeate a communitynwhen so many cops and guns are around. 
 In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,,I kept a notepad.,And in that notepad I countednmore Confederate flags than black people.,In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags,on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,,and on cars. 
 About a seven-minute drivenfrom my hidden lake cabin,was the compound of Aryan Nations,,the white supremacist group.,America's Promise Ministries,nthe religious arm of Aryan Nations,,happened to have a three-daynretreat during my visit.,So I decided to crash it.,(Laughter),I'm the only non-Aryan journalistnI'm aware of ever to have done so.,(Laughter),Among the many memorablenepisodes of that retreat...,(Laughter),...is when Abe, an Aryan,nsidled up next to me.,He slapped my knee, and he said, "HeynRich, I just want you to know one thing.,We are not white supremacists.nWe are white separatists.,We don't think we're better than you,,we just want to be away from you.",(Laughter) 
 Indeed, most white people in Whitopianare neither white supremacists,or white separatists;,in fact, they're not therenfor explicitly racial reasons at all.,Rather, they emigrate there,for friendliness, comfort,nsecurity, safety --,reasons that they implicitly associatento whiteness in itself. 
 Next stop was Georgia.,In Georgia, I stayed in an exurbnnorth of Atlanta.,In Utah, I found poker;,in Idaho, I found guns;,in Georgia, I found God.,(Laughter),The way that I immersed myselfnin this Whitopia,was to become activenat First Redeemer Church,,a megachurch that's so hugenthat it has golf carts,to escort the congregants aroundnits many parking lots on campus.,I was active in the youth ministry.,And for me, personally,nI was more comfortable in this Whitopia,than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,nor even a suburban Boston.,That is because [there], in Georgia,,white people and black people are morenhistorically familiar to one another.,I was less exotic in this Whitopia.,(Laughter) 
 But what does it all mean?,Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,nis a push-pull phenomenon,,full of alarming pushesnand alluring pulls,,and Whitopia operates at the levelnof conscious and unconscious bias.,It's possible for people to be in Whitopiannot for racist reasons,,though it has racist outcomes.,Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,,social welfare abuse, minorities,ndensity, crowded schools.,Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,,freedom, the allure of privatism --nprivatized places, privatized people,,privatized things.,And I learned in Whitopianhow a country can have racism,without racists. 
 Many of my smug urban liberal friends,couldn't believe I would gonon such a venture.,The reality is that many white Americansnare affable and kind.,Interpersonal race relations --nhow we treat each other as human beings --,are vastly better than innmy parents' generation.,Can you imagine me goingnto Whitopia 40 years ago?,What a journey that would have been.,(Laughter),And yet, some things haven't changed.,America is as residentiallynand educationally segregated today,as it was in 1970. 
 As Americans, we often find waysnto cook for each other,,to dance with each other,,to host with each other,,but why can't that translate into how wentreat each other as communities?,It's a devastating irony,,how we have gone forward as individuals,,and backwards as communities. 
 One of the Whitopian outlooksnthat really hit me,was a proverbial saying:,"One black man isna delightful dinner guest;,50 black men is a ghetto." 
 One of the big contexts animatingnmy Whitopian journey was the year 2042.,By 2042, white people will no longer benthe American majority.,As such, will there be more Whitopias?,In looking at this,,the danger of Whitopia isnthat the more segregation we have,,the less we can look at and confrontnconscious and unconscious bias. 
 I ventured on my two-year,n27,000 mile journey,to learn where, why, and hownwhite people are fleeing,,but I didn't expect to havenso much fun on my journey.,(Laughter),I didn't expect to learnnso much about myself.,I don't expect I'll be livingnin a Whitopia --,or a Blacktopia, for that matter.,I do plan to continue golfingnevery chance I get.,(Laughter),And I'll just have to leave the gunsnand megachurches back in Whitopia. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Over a million people are killedneach year in disasters.,Two and a half million peoplenwill be permanently disabled or displaced,,and the communities will taken20 to 30 years to recover,and billions of economic losses. 
 If you can reducenthe initial response by one day,,you can reduce the overall recovery,by a thousand days, or three years.,See how that works?,If the initial respondersncan get in, save lives,,mitigate whatever floodingndanger there is,,that means the other groups can get in,to restore the water,nthe roads, the electricity,,which means then the construction people,nthe insurance agents,,all of them can get innto rebuild the houses,,which then meansnyou can restore the economy,,and maybe even make it betternand more resilient to the next disaster.,A major insurance company told me,that if they can get a homeowner's claimnprocessed one day earlier,,it'll make a difference of six months,in that person gettingntheir home repaired. 
 And that's why I do disaster robotics --,because robots cannmake a disaster go away faster. 
 Now, you've already seenna couple of these.,These are the UAVs.,These are two types of UAVs:,a rotorcraft, or hummingbird;,a fixed-wing, a hawk.,And they're used extensively since 2005 --,Hurricane Katrina.,Let me show you how this hummingbird,nthis rotorcraft, works.,Fantastic for structural engineers.,Being able to see damage from angles youncan't get from binoculars on the ground,or from a satellite image,,or anything flying at a higher angle.,But it's not just structural engineersnand insurance people who need this.,You've got thingsnlike this fixed-wing, this hawk.,Now, this hawk can be usednfor geospatial surveys.,That's where you'renpulling imagery together,and getting 3D reconstruction. 
 We used both of these at the Oso mudslidesnup in Washington State,,because the big problem,was geospatial and hydrologicalnunderstanding of the disaster --,not the search and rescue.,The search and rescue teamsnhad it under control,and knew what they were doing.,The bigger problem was that rivernand mudslide might wipe them out,and flood the responders.,And not only was it challengingnto the responders and property damage,,it's also putting at risknthe future of salmon fishing,along that part of Washington State.,So they needed to understandnwhat was going on.,In seven hours, going from Arlington,,driving from the Incident Command Postnto the site, flying the UAVs,,processing the data, driving backnto Arlington command post --,seven hours.,We gave them in seven hoursndata that they could take,only two to three daysnto get any other way --,and at higher resolution.,It's a game changer. 
 And don't just think about the UAVs.,I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,,80 percent of the world'snpopulation lives by water,,and that means our criticalninfrastructure is underwater --,the parts that we can't get to,nlike the bridges and things like that.,And that's why we havenunmanned marine vehicles,,one type of which you've already met,nwhich is SARbot, a square dolphin.,It goes underwater and uses sonar.,Well, why are marine vehicles so important,and why are they very, very important?,They get overlooked.,Think about the Japanese tsunami --,400 miles of coastland totally devastated,,twice the amount of coastland devastatednby Hurricane Katrina in the United States.,You're talking about your bridges,nyour pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.,And if you don't have a port,,you don't have a waynto get in enough relief supplies,to support a population.,That was a huge problemnat the Haiti earthquake.,So we need marine vehicles. 
 Now, let's look at a viewpointnfrom the SARbot,of what they were seeing.,We were working on a fishing port.,We were able to reopen that fishing port,nusing her sonar, in four hours.,That fishing port was toldnit was going to be six months,before they could getna manual team of divers in,,and it was going to takenthe divers two weeks.,They were going to missnthe fall fishing season,,which was the major economy for that part,nwhich is kind of like their Cape Cod.,UMVs, very important. 
 But you know, all the robotsnI've shown you have been small,,and that's because robotsndon't do things that people do.,They go places people can't go.,And a great example of that is Bujold.,Unmanned ground vehiclesnare particularly small,,so Bujold -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Say hello to Bujold. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bujold was used extensivelynat the World Trade Center,to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.,You're climbing into the rubble,nrappelling down, going deep in spaces.,And just to see the World Trade Centernfrom Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.,You're talking about a disasternwhere you can't fit a person or a dog --,and it's on fire.,The only hope of gettingnto a survivor way in the basement,,you have to go through thingsnthat are on fire.,It was so hot, on one of the robots,nthe tracks began to melt and come off.,Robots don't replace people or dogs,,or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.,They do things new.,They assist the responders,nthe experts, in new and innovative ways. 
 The biggest problem is notnmaking the robots smaller, though.,It's not making them more heat-resistant.,It's not making more sensors.,The biggest problem is the data,nthe informatics,,because these people need to getnthe right data at the right time. 
 So wouldn't it be great if we could havenexperts immediately access the robots,without having to waste any timenof driving to the site,,so whoever's there,nuse their robots over the Internet.,Well, let's think about that.,Let's think about a chemicalntrain derailment in a rural county.,What are the odds that the experts,nyour chemical engineer,,your railroad transportation engineers,,have been trained on whatever UAVnthat particular county happens to have?,Probably, like, none.,So we're using these kinds of interfaces,to allow people to use the robotsnwithout knowing what robot they're using,,or even if they're using a robot or not.,What the robots give you,nwhat they give the experts, is data. 
 The problem becomes:nwho gets what data when?,One thing to do is to shipnall the information to everybody,and let them sort it out.,Well, the problem with thatnis it overwhelms the networks,,and worse yet, it overwhelmsnthe cognitive abilities,of each of the people trying to getnthat one nugget of information,they need to make the decisionnthat's going to make the difference.,So we need to thinknabout those kinds of challenges.,So it's the data. 
 Going back to the World Trade Center,,we tried to solve that problemnby just recording the data from Bujold,only when she was deep in the rubble,,because that's what the USAR teamnsaid they wanted.,What we didn't know at the time,was that the civil engineersnwould have loved,,needed the data as we recordednthe box beams, the serial numbers,,the locations, as we went into the rubble.,We lost valuable data.,So the challenge is getting all the data,and getting it to the right people. 
 Now, here's another reason.,We've learned that some buildings --,things like schools,nhospitals, city halls --,get inspected four timesnby different agencies,throughout the response phases.,Now, we're looking, if we can getnthe data from the robots to share,,not only can we do things likencompress that sequence of phases,to shorten the response time,,but now we can beginnto do the response in parallel.,Everybody can see the data.,We can shorten it that way. 
 So really, "disaster robotics"nis a misnomer.,It's not about the robots.,It's about the data. 
 (Applause) 
 So my challenge to you:,the next time you hear about a disaster,,look for the robots.,They may be underground,nthey may be underwater,,they may be in the sky,,but they should be there.,Look for the robots,,because robots are coming to the rescue. 
 (Applause)I am failing as a woman,,I am failing as a feminist. 
 I have passionate opinionsnabout gender equality,,but I worry that to freely acceptnthe label of "feminist,",would not be fair to good feminists. 
 I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.,Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.,Or at least, I wrote an essay,,and then I wrote a bookncalled "Bad Feminist,",and then in interviews, people startedncalling me The Bad Feminist.,(Laughter) 
 So, what started as a bitnof an inside joke with myself,and a willful provocation,,has become a thing. 
 Let me take a step back.,When I was younger,,mostly in my teens and 20s,,I had strange ideas about feminists,as hairy, angry, man-hating,nsex-hating women --,as if those are bad things.,(Laughter),These days, I look at hownwomen are treated the world over,,and anger, in particular, seemsnlike a perfectly reasonable response. 
 But back then,,I worried about the tone people used,when suggesting I might be a feminist.,The feminist label was an accusation,,it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.,I was labeled a womannwho doesn't play by the rules,,who expects too much,,who thinks far too highly of myself,,by daring to believe I'm equal --n(Coughs) -- superior to a man.,You don't want to be that rebel woman,,until you realize that younvery much are that woman,,and cannot imagine being anyone else. 
 As I got older, I began to accept,that I am, indeed, a feminist,nand a proud one.,I hold certain truths to be self-evident:,Women are equal to men.,We deserve equal pay for equal work.,We have the right to moventhrough the world as we choose,,free from harassment or violence.,We have the right to easy,naffordable access to birth control,,and reproductive services.,We have the right to make choicesnabout our bodies,,free from legislative oversightnor evangelical doctrine.,We have the right to respect. 
 There's more.,When we talk about the needs of women,,we have to considernthe other identities we inhabit.,We are not just women.,We are people with different bodies,,gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,,class backgrounds, abilities,nand so much more.,We need to take into account,these differences and how they affect us,,as much as we account fornwhat we have in common.,Without this kind of inclusion,nour feminism is nothing. 
 I hold these truths to be self-evident,nbut let me be clear:,I'm a mess.,I am full of contradictions.,There are many ways in whichnI'm doing feminism wrong. 
 I have another confession.,When I drive to work, I listennto thuggish rap at a very loud volume.,(Laughter),Even though the lyricsnare degrading to women --,these lyrics offend me to my core --,the classic Yin Yang Twinsnsong "Salt Shaker" --,it is amazing.,(Laughter),"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.,Bitch, you gotta shake itn'til your camel starts to hurt!",(Laughter),Think about it.,(Laughter),Poetry, right?,I am utterly mortifiednby my music choices.,(Laughter) 
 I firmly believe in man work,,which is anything I don'tnwant to do, including --,(Laughter) --,all domestic tasks,,but also: bug killing, trash removal,nlawn care and vehicle maintenance.,I want no part of any of that.,(Laughter),Pink is my favorite color.,I enjoy fashion magazinesnand pretty things.,I watch "The Bachelor"nand romantic comedies,,and I have absurd fantasiesnabout fairy tales coming true. 
 Some of my transgressionsnare more flagrant.,If a woman wants to takenher husband's name,,that is her choice, and it is notnmy place to judge.,If a woman chooses to stay homento raise her children,,I embrace that choice, too.,The problem is not that she makes herselfneconomically vulnerable in that choice;,the problem is that our society is set up,to make women economically vulnerablenwhen they choose.,Let's deal with that.,(Applause) 
 I reject the mainstream feminism,that has historically ignorednor deflected the needs,of women of color, working-class women,nqueer women and transgender women,,in favor of supporting white, middle-nand upper-class straight women.,Listen, if that's good feminism --nI am a very bad feminist.,(Laughter) 
 There is also this:,As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.,We have this tendency to putnvisible feminists on a pedestal.,We expect them to pose perfectly.,When they disappoint us,,we gleefully knock themnfrom the very pedestal we put them on.,Like I said, I am a mess --,consider me knocked off that pedestal,before you ever try to put me up there.,(Laughter) 
 Too many women,,particularly groundbreaking womennand industry leaders,,are afraid to be labeled as feminists.,They're afraid to stand up and say,n"Yes, I am a feminist,",for fear of what that label means,,for fear of being unable to live up tonunrealistic expectations. 
 Take, for example, Beyoncé,nor as I call her, The Goddess.,(Laughter),She has emerged, in recent years,nas a visible feminist.,At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,,she performed in front of the wordn"feminist" 10 feet high.,It was a glorious spectacle to see,this pop star openly embracing feminism,and letting young women and men know,that being a feministnis something to celebrate.,As the moment faded, cultural criticsnbegan endlessly debating,whether or not Beyoncé was,nindeed, a feminist.,They graded her feminism,,instead of simply taking a grown,naccomplished woman at her word.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 We demand perfection from feminists,,because we are still fighting for so much,,we want so much,,we need so damn much. 
 We go far beyond reasonable,nconstructive criticism,,to dissecting any given woman's feminism,,tearing it apartnuntil there's nothing left.,We do not need to do that.,Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusivenfeminism -- is a starting point. 
 But what happens next?,We go from acknowledgingnour imperfections to accountability,,or walking the walk,nand being a little bit brave.,If I listen to degrading music,,I am creating a demand for whichnartists are more than happy,to contribute a limitless supply.,These artists are not going to change,how they talk about women in their songs,until we demand that changenby affecting their bottom line.,Certainly, it is difficult.,Why must it be so catchy?,(Laughter),It's hard to make the better choice,,and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.,But --,when I justify bad choices,,I make it harder for womennto achieve equality,,the equality that we all deserve,,and I need to own that. 
 I think of my nieces, ages three and four.,They are gorgeousnand headstrong, brilliant girls,,who are a whole lot of brave.,I want them to thrive in a worldnwhere they are valued,for the powerful creatures they are.,I think of them,,and suddenly, the better choicenbecomes far easier to make. 
 We can all make better choices.,We can change the channelnwhen a television show,treats sexual violencenagainst women like sport,,Game of Thrones.,We can change the radio station,when we hear songsnthat treat women as nothing.,We can spend ournbox office dollars elsewhere,when movies don't treat women,as anything more than decorative objects.,We can stop supporting professional sports,where the athletes treat ntheir partners like punching bags.,(Applause) 
 In other ways, men --nand especially straight white men --,can say, "No, I will not publishnwith your magazine,,or participate in your project,nor otherwise work with you,,until you include a fair number of women,,both as participants and decision makers.,I won't work with younuntil your publication,,or your organization, is more inclusivenof all kinds of difference." 
 Those of us who are underrepresented,and invited to participatenin such projects,,can also decline to be included,until more of us are invitednthrough the glass ceiling,,and we are tokens no more. 
 Without these efforts,,without taking these stands,,our accomplishmentsnare going to mean very little.,We can commit these small acts of bravery,and hope that our choices tricklenupward to the people in power --,editors, movie and music producers,,CEOs, lawmakers --,the people who can makenbigger, braver choices,to create lasting, meaningful change. 
 We can also boldly claim our feminism --,good, bad, or anywhere in between.,The last line of my bookn"Bad Feminist" says,,"I would rather be a bad feministnthan no feminist at all.",This is true for so many reasons,,but first and foremost, I say thisnbecause once upon a time,,my voice was stolen from me,,and feminism helped mento get my voice back. 
 There was an incident.,I call it an incident so I can carrynthe burden of what happened.,Some boys broke me,,when I was so young, I did not know,what boys can do to break a girl.,They treated me like I was nothing.,I began to believe I was nothing.,They stole my voice, and in the after,,I did not dare to believe,that anything I might say could matter. 
 But --,I had writing.,And there, I wrote myself back together.,I wrote myself toward a strongernversion of myself.,I read the words of women,who might understand a story like mine,,and women who looked like me,,and understood what it was like to moventhrough the world with brown skin.,I read the words of womennwho showed me I was not nothing.,I learned to write like them,,and then I learned to write as myself.,I found my voice again,,and I started to believe that my voicenis powerful beyond measure. 
 Through writing and feminism,,I also found that if I wasna little bit brave,,another woman might hear menand see me and recognize,that none of us are the nothingnthe world tries to tell us we are. 
 In one hand,,I hold the power to accomplish anything.,And in my other,,I hold the humbling realitynthat I am just one woman. 
 I am a bad feminist,,I am a good woman,,I am trying to become betternin how I think,,and what I say, and what I do,,without abandoning everythingnthat makes me human.,I hope that we can all do the same.,I hope that we can all bena little bit brave,,when we most need such bravery.,(Applause)(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan.nIn the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful. 
 (English) I was bornnin a middle class family.,My father was five years oldnwhen he lost his father,,but by the time I was born,,he was already a businessman.,But it didn't make a difference to him,if his children were going to bena boy or a girl:,they were going to go to school.,So I guess I was the lucky one. 
 My mother had 16 pregnancies.,From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.,You can imagine as a childnwhat I went through.,Day to day, I watched women,being carried to a graveyard,,or watched children going to a graveyard.,At that time, when Infinished my high school,,I really wanted to be a doctor.,I wanted to be a doctornto help women and children.,So I completed my education,,but I wanted to go to university.,Unfortunately, in my country,nthere wasn't a dormitory for girls,,so I was accepted in medical school,nbut I could not go there.,So as a result, my fathernsent me to America. 
 I came to America.,I completed my education.,While I was completing my education,,my country was invaded by Russia.,And do you know that at the timenI was completing my education,,I didn't know what was going onnwith my family or with my country.,There were months, years,nI didn't know about it.,My family was in a refugee camp.,So as soon as I completed my education,,I brought my family to America.,I wanted them to be safe. 
 But where was my heart?,My heart was in Afghanistan.,Day after day,nwhen I listened to the news,,when I followed what wasngoing on with my country,,my heart was breaking up.,I really wanted to go back to my country,,but at the same time I knewnI could not go there,,because there was no place for me.,I had a good job.,I was a professor at a university.,I earned good money.,I had a good life.,My family was here.,I could live with them.,But I wasn't happy.,I wanted to go back home.,So I went to the refugee camp.,And when I wentnto the refugee camp in Pakistan,,there were 7.5 million refugees.,7.5 million refugees.,About 90 percent of themnwere women and children.,Most of the men have been killednor they were in war.,And you know, in the refugee camp,,when I went day-to-day to do a survey,,I found things you never could imagine.,I saw a widow with five to eight children,sitting there and weeping,and not knowing what to do.,I saw a young womannhave no way to go anywhere,,no education, no entertainment,nno place to even live.,I saw young men that had lostntheir father and their home,,and they are supporting the familynas a 10-to-12-year old boy --,being the head of the household,,trying to protect their sisternand their mother and their children. 
 So it was a very devastating situation.,My heart was beating for my people,,and I didn't know what to do.,At that moment, we talk about momentum.,At that moment, I felt,nwhat can I do for these people?,How could I help these people?,I am one individual.nWhat can I do for them? 
 But at that moment, I knew,that education changed my life.,It transformed me. It gave me status.,It gave me confidence.nIt gave me a career.,It helped me to support my family,,to bring my family to another country,,to be safe.,And I knew that at that moment,that what I should give to my peoplenis education and health,,and that's what I went after. 
 But do you think it was easy?,No, because at that time, educationnwas banned for girls, completely.,And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,,people were not trusting anyone.,It was very hard to come and say,n"I want to do this.",Who am I?,Somebody who comes from the United States.,Somebody who got educated here.,Did they trust me? Of course not. 
 So I really needed to buildnthe trust in this community.,How am I going to do that?,I went and surveyed and looked and looked.,I asked.,Finally, I found one man.,He was 80 years old.,He was a mullah.,I went to his tent in the camp,,and I asked him,,"I want to make you a teacher.",And he looked at me,,and he said, "Crazy woman,,crazy woman, how do you thinknI can be a teacher?",And I told him,n"I will make you a teacher.",Finally, he accepted my offer,,and once I started a classnin his compound,,the word spread all over.,In a matter of one year,,we had 25 schools set up,,15,000 children going to school,,and it was amazing. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you. 
 But of course, we're doing all our work,nwe were giving teacher training.,We were training women's rights,nhuman rights, democracy, rule of law.,We were giving all kinds of training.,And one day, I tell you,,one day I was in the officenin Peshawar, Pakistan.,All of a sudden, I saw my staffnrunning to rooms and locking the doors,and telling me, "Run away, hide!",And you know, as a leader, what do you do?,You're scared. You know it's dangerous.,You know your life is on the line.,But as a leader,nyou have to hold it together.,You have to hold it togethernand show strength.,So I said, "What's going on?",And these people were pouringninto my office.,So I invited them to the office.,They came, and there werennine of them -- nine Taliban.,They were the ugliest looking mennyou can ever see. 
 (Laughter) 
 Very mean-looking people,,black clothes, black turban,,and they pour into my office.,And I invited themnto have a seat and have tea.,They said no. They are notngoing to drink tea.,And of course, with the tonenof voice they were using,,it was very scary,,but I was really shaking up.,But also I was strong, holding myself up.,And, of course, by that time,nyou know how I dress --,I dress from head to toe in a black hijab.,The only thing you could see, my eyes.,They asked me, "What are you doing?,Don't you know that schoolnis banned for girls?,What are you doing here?",And you know, I just looked at them,,and I said, "What school?nWhere is the school?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And they look at my face, and they said,n"You are teaching girls here.",I said, "This is a house of somebody.,We have some students coming,,and they are all learningnKoran, Holy Book.,And you know, Koran says thatnif you learn the Holy Book, the woman,,they can be a good wife,,and they can obey their husband." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I tell you one thing:,that's the way you work with those people,nand you know -- 
 (Laughter) 
 So by that time,nthey started speaking Pashto.,They talked to each other,,and they said, "Let's go,nleave her alone, she's OK.",And you know, this time,nI offered them tea again,,and they took a sip and they left.,By that time, my staffnpoured into my office.,They were scared to death.,They didn't know why they didn't kill me.,They didn't know whynthey didn't take me away.,But everybody was happy to see me.,Very happy, and I was happynto be alive, of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, I was happy to be alive.,But also, as we continuously gaventraining during the fall of the Taliban --,of course during the Talibannthere is another story.,We went underground and we providedneducation for 80 schoolgirls,,3,000 students underground,nand continuously we trained. 
 With the fall of the Taliban,nwe went into the country,,and we opened school after school.,We opened women's learning center.,We continuously opened clinics.,We worked with mothers and children.,We had reproductive health training.,We had all kinds of trainingnthat you can imagine.,I was very happy. I was delightednwith the outcome of my work.,And one day, with four trainersnand one bodyguard,,I was going up north of Kabul,,and all of a sudden, again,,I was stopped in the middle of the road,by 19 young men.,Rifles on their shoulders,nthey blocked the road.,And I told my driver, "What's going on?",And the driver said, "I don't know.",He asked them. They said,n"We have nothing to do with you.",They called my name.nThey said, "We want her.",My bodyguard got out, said,n"I can answer you.,What do you want?",They said, "Nothing." They called my name.,And by that time, the womennare yelling and screaming inside the car.,I am very shaken up,nand I told myself, this is it.,This time, we all are going to be killed.,There is no doubt in my mind.,But still, the moment comes,nand you take strength,from whatever you believenand whatever you do.,It's in your heart.,You believe in your worth,nand you can walk on it. 
 So I just hold myselfnon the side of the car.,My leg was shaking, and I got outside.,And I asked them, "What can I do for you?",You know what they said to me?,They said, "We know who you are.,We know where you are going.,Every day you go up north here and there.,You train women, you teach them,and also you give them annopportunity to have a job.,You build their skills. How about us?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "And you know, how about us?,What are we going to do?",I looked at them, and I said,n"I don't know." 
 (Laughter) 
 They said, "It's OK.,The only thing we can do, what we know,,from the time we're born,nwe just hold the gun and kill.,That's all we know.",And you know what that means.,It's a trap to me, of course.,So I walk out of there.nThey said, "We'll let you go, go.",And so I walked into the car,nI sit in the car,,and I told the driver,n"Turn around and go back to the office.",At that time, we onlynwere supporting girls.,We only had money for women to train them,,to send them to school, and nothing else. 
 By the time I came to the office,,of course my trainers were gone.,They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.,My bodyguard was the only one there,,and my voice was completely gone.,I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,,and I said, "What am I going to do?",How am I going to solve this problem?,Because we had trainingngoing on up north already.,Hundreds of women were therencoming to get training. 
 So I was sitting there,nall of a sudden, at this moment,,talking about momentum, we are,,at that moment,,one of my wonderful donorsncalled me about a report.,And she asked me, "Sakena?"nAnd I answered her.,She said, "It's not you.nWhat's wrong with you?",I said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.,No matter what I tried to do,nshe didn't believe me,,and she asked me again.,"OK, tell me what's going on?",I told her the whole story.,At that time, she said, "OK,nyou go next time, and you will help them.,You will help them.",And when, two days later,nI went the same route,,and do you know, they were not in here,,they were a little back further,,the same young men, standing up therenand holding the rifle,and pointing to us to stop the car.,So we stopped the car.,I got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me.",And they said, "Yes.",I said, "On one condition,nthat whatever I say, you accept it.",And they said, yes, they do.,So I took them to the mosque,,and to make a long story short,,I told them I'd give them teachers.,Today, they are the best trainers.,They learn English,,they learn how to be teachers,,they learn computers,,and they are my guides.,Every area that is unknown to usnin the mountain areas,,they go with me.nThey are ahead, and we go.,And they protect us.,And -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 That tells you that educationntransforms people.,When you educate people,,they are going to be different,,and today all over,,we need to work for gender equality.,We cannot only train womennbut forget about the men,,because the men are the real peoplenwho are giving women the hardest time. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we started training mennbecause the men should know,the potential of women,,know how much these potential men has,,and how much these womenncan do the same job they are doing.,So we are continuously givingntraining to men,,and I really believe strongly.,I live in a countrynthat was a beautiful country.,I just want to share this with you.,It was a beautiful country,,beautiful, peaceful country.,We were going everywhere.,Women were getting education:,lawyer, engineer, teacher,,and we were going from house to house.,We never locked our doors.,But you know what happened to my country.,Today, people cannot walknout of their door without security issues.,But we want the samenAfghanistan we had before.,And I want to tell you the other side.,Today, the women of Afghanistannare working very, very hard.,They are earning degrees.nThey are training to be lawyers.,They are training to bendoctors, back again.,They are training to be teachers,,and they are running businesses.,So it is so wonderful,to see people like thatnreach their complete potential,,and all of this is going to happen. 
 I want to share this with you,,because of love,,because of compassion,,and because of trust and honesty.,If you have these few things with you,,you will accomplish.,We have one poet, Mawlānā Rūmī.,He said that by having compassion,and having love,nyou can conquer the world.,And I tell you, we could.,And if we could do it in Afghanistan,,I am sure 100 percent that everyonencan do it in any part of the world. 
 Thank you very, very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Periods.,Blood.,Menstruation.,Gross.,Secret.,Hidden.,Why? 
 A natural biological process,that every girl and womanngoes through every month,for about half of her life.,A phenomenon that is so significant,that the survival and propagationnof our species depends on it.,Yet we consider it a taboo.,We feel awkwardnand shameful talking about it. 
 When I got my first periods,,I was told to keep itna secret from others --,even from my father and brother.,Later when this chapternappeared in our textbooks,,our biology teacher skipped the subject. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know what I learned from it?,I learned that it is reallynshameful to talk about it.,I learned to be ashamed of my body.,I learned to stay unaware of periods,in order to stay decent. 
 Research in various parts of India,shows that three out of every 10 girlsnare not aware of menstruation,at the time of their first periods.,And in some parts of Rajasthan,this number is as high as ninenout of 10 girls being unaware of it.,You'd be surprised to know,that most of the girlsnthat I have spoken to,,who did not know about periodsnat the time of their first menstruation,thought that they have got blood cancer,and they're going to die soon. 
 Menstrual hygienenis a very important risk factor,for reproductive tract infections.,But in India, only 12 percentnof girls and women,have access to hygienic waysnof managing their periods.,If you do the math,,88 percent of girls and women usenunhygienic ways to manage their periods. 
 I was one of them.,I grew up in a small townncalled Garhwa, in Jharkhand,,where even buying a sanitary napkinnis considered shameful.,So when I started getting my periods,,I began with using rags.,After every usenI would wash and reuse them.,But to store them,,I would hide and keep itnin a dark, damp place,so that nobody finds outnthat I'm menstruating.,Due to repeated washingnthe rags would become coarse,,and I would often get rashesnand infections using them. 
 I wore these already for five yearsnuntil I moved out of that town.,Another issuenthat periods brought in my life,those of the social restrictions,that are imposed upon our girlsnand women when they're on their periods.,I think you all must be aware of it,,but I'll still list itnfor the few who don't. 
 I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.,I was not allowed to sit on the sofanor some other family member's bed.,I had to wash my bed sheetnafter every period,,even if it was not stained.,I was considered impure,and forbidden from worshipping or touchingnany object of religious importance.,You'll find signposts outside temples,denying the entrynof menstruating girls and women. 
 Ironically,,most of the time it is the older woman,who imposes such restrictionsnon younger girls in a family.,After all, they have grown upnaccepting such restrictions as norms.,And in the absence of any intervention,,it is the myth and misconception,that propagatenfrom generation to generation. 
 During my years of work in this field,,I have even come across stories,where girls have to eatnand wash their dishes separately.,They're not allowednto take baths during periods,,and in some households they are evennsecluded from other family members.,About 85 percent of girlsnand women in India,would follow one or more restrictivencustoms on their periods every month.,Can you imagine what this does,to the self-esteemnand self-confidence of a young girl?,The psychological traumanthat this inflicts,,affecting her personality,,her academic performance,and every single aspect of growing upnduring her early formative years? 
 I religiously followed all thesenrestrictive customs for 13 years,,until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,,changed my perceptionnabout menstruation forever.,In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuingnour postgraduation in design.,We fell in love with each other,and I was at easendiscussing periods with him.,Tuhin knew little about periods. 
 (Laughter) 
 He was astonished to knownthat girls get painful cramps,and we bleed every month. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,He was completely shocked to know,about the restrictions that are imposednupon menstruating girls and women,by their own families and their society.,In order to help me with my cramps,,he would go on the Internetnand learn more about menstruation.,When he shared his findings with me,,I realized how little I knewnabout menstruation myself.,And many of my beliefsnactually turned out to be myths. 
 That's when we wondered:,if we, being so well educated,,were so ill-informed about menstruation,,there would be millions of girls out therenwho would be ill-informed, too.,To study --,to understand the problem better,,I undertook a year-long research to studynthe lack of awareness about menstruation,and the root cause behind it. 
 While it is generally believed,that menstrual unawarenessnand misconception is a rural phenomenon,,during my research,,I found that it is as muchnan urban phenomenon as well.,And it exists with the educatednurban class, also.,While talking to manynparents and teachers,,I found that many of them actuallynwanted to educate girls about periods,before they have startedngetting their menstrual cycle.,And --,but they lackednthe proper means themselves.,And since it is a taboo,,they feel inhibitionnand shameful in talking about it. 
 Girls nowadays get their periodsnin classes six and seven,,but our educational curriculum,teaches girls about periodsnonly in standard eight and nine.,And since it is a taboo,,teachers stillnskip the subject altogether. 
 So school does notnteach girls about periods,,parents don't talk about it.,Where do the girls go?,Two decades ago and now --,nothing has changed.,I shared these finding with Tuhinnand we wondered:,What if we could create something,that would help girls understandnabout menstruation on their own --,something that would helpnparents and teachers,talk about periodsncomfortably to young girls? 
 During my research,,I was collecting a lot of stories.,These were stories of experiencesnof girls during their periods.,These stories would make girlsncurious and interested,in talking about menstruationnin their close circle.,That's what we wanted.,We wanted somethingnthat would make the girls curious,and drive them to learn about it.,We wanted to use these storiesnto teach girls about periods. 
 So we decided to create a comic book,,where the cartoon charactersnwould enact these stories,and educate girls about menstruationnin a fun and engaging way.,To represent girlsnin their different phases of puberty,,we have three characters.,Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet,,Jiya who gets her periodnduring the narrative of the book,and Mira who has alreadynbeen getting her period.,There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.,Through her, girls come to knownabout the various aspects of growing up,and menstrual hygiene management. 
 While making the book, we took great care,that none of the illustrationsnwere objectionable in any way,and that it is culturally sensitive.,During our prototype testing,nwe found that the girls loved the book.,They were keen on reading it,and knowing more and morenabout periods on their own.,Parents and teachers werencomfortable in talking about periods,to young girls using the book,,and sometimes even boysnwere interested in reading it. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The comic book helpednin creating an environment,where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.,Many of the volunteers took this prototypenthemselves to educate girls,and take menstrual awareness workshopsnin five different states in India.,And one of the volunteersntook this prototype to educate young monks,and took it to this monastery in Ladakh. 
 We made the final version of the book,ncalled "Menstrupedia Comic",and launched in September last year.,And so far,,more than 4,000 girls have beenneducated by using the book in India and -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 And 10 different countries.,We are constantly translating the bookninto different languages,and collaborating with local organizations,to make this book availablenin different countries. 
 15 schools in different parts of India,have made this bookna part of their school curriculum,to teach girls about menstruation. 
 (Applause) 
 I am amazed to see how volunteers,,individuals, parents,nteachers, school principals,,have come together,and taken this menstrual awarenessndrive to their own communities,,have made sure that the girlsnlearn about periods at the right age,and helped in breaking this taboo. 
 I dream of a futurenwhere menstruation is not a curse,,not a disease,,but a welcoming change in a girl's life.,And I would -- 
 (Applause) 
 And I would like to end this,with a small requestnto all the parents here. 
 Dear parents,,if you would be ashamed of periods,,your daughters would be, too.,So please be period positive. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So on my way here,,the passenger next to me and Inhad a very interesting conversation,during my flight.,He told me, "It seems likenthe United States has run out of jobs,,because they're just making some up:,cat psychologist, dog whisperer,ntornado chaser." 
 A couple of seconds later, he asked me,,"So what do you do?" 
 And I was like, "Peacebuilder?",(Laughter) 
 Every day, I work to amplifynthe voices of women,and to highlight their experiences,and their participation in peacenprocesses and conflict resolution,,and because of my work,,I recognize that the only way to ensurenthe full participation of women globally,is by reclaiming religion. 
 Now, this matter is vitallynimportant to me.,As a young Muslim woman,nI am very proud of my faith.,It gives me the strength and convictionnto do my work every day.,It's the reason I can be herenin front of you.,But I can't overlook the damage that hasnbeen done in the name of religion,,not just my own, but allnof the world's major faiths.,The misrepresentation and misusenand manipulation of religious scripture,has influenced our socialnand cultural norms,,our laws, our daily lives,,to a point where we sometimesndon't recognize it. 
 My parents moved from Libya,nNorth Africa, to Canada,in the early 1980s,,and I am the middle child of 11 children.,Yes, 11.,But growing up, I saw my parents,,both religiously devoutnand spiritual people,,pray and praise God for their blessings,,namely me of course, but among others.n(Laughter),They were kind and funny and patient,,limitlessly patient, the kind of patiencenthat having 11 kids forces you to have.,And they were fair.,I was never subjected to religionnthrough a cultural lens.,I was treated the same,,the same was expected of me.,I was never taught that Godnjudged differently based on gender.,And my parents' understanding of Godnas a merciful and beneficial friend,and provider shaped the waynI looked at the world. 
 Now, of course, my upbringingnhad additional benefits.,Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101.n(Laughter),To this day, I am askednwhere I went to school,,like, "Did you go tonKennedy School of Government?",and I look at them and I'm like, "No,,I went to the Murabit Schoolnof International Affairs.",It's extremely exclusive. You would havento talk to my mom to get in.,Lucky for you, she's here.,But being one of 11 childrennand having 10 siblings,teaches you a lot aboutnpower structures and alliances.,It teaches you focus; you havento talk fast or say less,,because you will always get cut off.,It teaches you the importancenof messaging.,You have to ask questions in the right waynto get the answers you know you want,,and you have to say nonin the right way to keep the peace. 
 But the most important lessonnI learned growing up,was the importance of being at the table.,When my mom's favorite lamp broke,nI had to be there when she was trying,to find out how and by who,nbecause I had to defend myself,,because if you're not,nthen the finger is pointed at you,,and before you know it,nyou will be grounded.,I am not speakingnfrom experience, of course. 
 When I was 15 in 2005,nI completed high school and I moved,from Canada -- Saskatoon --,to Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,,a very traditional city.,Mind you, I had only ever beennto Libya before on vacation,,and as a seven-year-old girl,nit was magic.,It was ice cream and trips to the beachnand really excited relatives. 
 Turns out it's not the samenas a 15-year-old young lady.,I very quickly became introducednto the cultural aspect of religion.,The words "haram" --nmeaning religiously prohibited --,and "aib" -- meaningnculturally inappropriate --,were exchanged carelessly,,as if they meant the same thingnand had the same consequences.,And I found myself in conversationnafter conversation with classmates,and colleagues, professors,nfriends, even relatives,,beginning to question my own rolenand my own aspirations.,And even with the foundationnmy parents had provided for me,,I found myself questioningnthe role of women in my faith. 
 So at the Murabit Schoolnof International Affairs,,we go very heavy on the debate,,and rule number one is do your research,nso that's what I did,,and it surprised me how easy it was,to find women in my faithnwho were leaders,,who were innovative, who were strong --,politically, economically,neven militarily.,Khadija financed the Islamic movement,in its infancy.,We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.,So why weren't we learning about her?,Why weren't we learning about these women?,Why were women being relegatednto positions which predated,the teachings of our faith?,And why, if we are equalnin the eyes of God,,are we not equal in the eyes of men? 
 To me, it all came back to the lessonsnI had learned as a child.,The decision maker, the personnwho gets to control the message,,is sitting at the table,,and unfortunately,nin every single world faith,,they are not women.,Religious institutionsnare dominated by men,and driven by male leadership,,and they create policiesnin their likeness,,and until we can changenthe system entirely,,then we can't realisticallynexpect to have full economic,and political participation of women.,Our foundation is broken.,My mom actually says, you can't buildna straight house on a crooked foundation. 
 In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out,nand my family was on the front lines.,And there's this amazing thingnthat happens in war,,a cultural shift almost, very temporary.,And it was the first time that I feltnit was not only acceptable,for me to be involved,nbut it was encouraged.,It was demanded.,Myself and other womennhad a seat at the table.,We weren't holding hands or a medium.,We were part of decision making.,We were information sharing.nWe were crucial.,And I wanted and needednfor that change to be permanent. 
 Turns out, that's not that easy.,It only took a few weeks before the womennthat I had previously worked with,were returning backnto their previous roles,,and most of them were drivennby words of encouragement,from religious and political leaders,,most of whom cited religious scripturenas their defense.,It's how they gained popular supportnfor their opinions. 
 So initially, I focused on the economicnand political empowerment of women.,I thought that would leadnto cultural and social change.,It turns out, it does a little,nbut not a lot.,I decided to usentheir defense as my offense,,and I began to cite and highlightnIslamic scripture as well. 
 In 2012 and 2013, my organizationnled the single largest,and most widespreadncampaign in Libya.,We entered homes and schoolsnand universities, even mosques.,We spoke to 50,000 people directly,,and hundreds of thousands more throughnbillboards and television commercials,,radio commercials and posters. 
 And you're probably wondering howna women's rights organization,was able to do this in communitiesnwhich had previously opposed,our sheer existence.,I used scripture.,I used verses from the Qurannand sayings of the Prophet,,Hadiths, his sayings whichnare, for example,,"The best of you is the bestnto their family.","Do not let your brother oppress another.",For the first time, Friday sermonsnled by local community imams,promoted the rights of women.,They discussed taboo issues,nlike domestic violence.,Policies were changed.,In certain communities,nwe actually had to go as far,as saying the InternationalnHuman Rights Declaration,,which you opposed because it wasn'tnwritten by religious scholars,,well, those same principlesnare in our book.,So really, the United Nationsnjust copied us. 
 By changing the message,nwe were able to provide,an alternative narrative which promotednthe rights of women in Libya.,It's something that has nownbeen replicated internationally,,and while I am not saying it's easy --nbelieve me, it's not.,Liberals will say you're using religionnand call you a bad conservative.,Conservatives will call youna lot of colorful things.,I've heard everything from, "Your parentsnmust be extremely ashamed of you" --,false; they're my biggest fans --,to "You will not make itnto your next birthday" --,again wrong, because I did.,And I remain,a very strong believer that women's rightsnand religion are not mutually exclusive.,But we have to be at the table.,We have to stop giving up our position,nbecause by remaining silent,,we allow for the continued persecutionnand abuse of women worldwide.,By saying that we're goingnto fight for women's rights,and fight extremismnwith bombs and warfare,,we completely cripple local societiesnwhich need to address these issues,so that they're sustainable. 
 It is not easy, challengingndistorted religious messaging.,You will have your fair sharenof insults and ridicule and threats.,But we have to do it.,We have no other option than to reclaimnthe message of human rights,,the principles of our faith,,not for us, not fornthe women in your families,,not for the women in this room,,not even for the women out there,,but for societiesnthat would be transformed,with the participation of women.,And the only way we can do that,,our only option,,is to be, and remain, at the table. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Every group of female friendsnhas the funny one,,the one you go tonwhen you need a good cry,,the one who tells you to suck it upnwhen you've had a hard day.,And this group was no different.,Except that this was a communitynof groundbreaking women,who came together --,first to become teammates,nthen friends, and then family --,in the least likely of places:,on the Special Operations battlefield.,This was a group of womennwhose friendship and valor was cemented,not only by what they had seennand done at the tip of the spear,,but by the fact that they were there,at a time when women --nofficially, at least --,remained banned from ground combat,,and America had no idea they existed. 
 This story beginsnwith Special Operations leaders,,some of the most tested mennin the United States military, saying,,"We need women to help us wage this war.","America would never kill its waynto the end of its wars," it argued.,"Needed more knowledgenand more understanding." 
 And as everyone knows,,if you want to understand what's happeningnin a community and in a home,,you talk to women,,whether you're talking aboutnSouthern Afghanistan,,or Southern California.,But in this case,nmen could not talk to women,,because in a conservativenand traditional society like Afghanistan,,that would cause grave offense.,So you needed women soldiers out there.,That meant, at this time in the war,nthat the women who would be recruited,to serve alongside Army Rangersnand Navy SEALs,,would be seeing the kind of combatnexperienced by less than five percent,of the entire United States military.,Less than five percent. 
 So the call went out.,"Female soldiers:nBecome a part of history.,Join Special Operationsnon the battlefield in Afghanistan.",This is in 2011.,And from Alabama to Alaska,,a group of women who had alwaysnwanted to do something that mattered,alongside the best of the best,,and to make a differencenfor their country,,answered that call to serve.,And for them it was not about politics,nit was about serving with purpose. 
 And so, the women who camento North Carolina,to compete for a spot on these teams,which would put womennon the Special Operations front lines,,landed and foundnvery quickly a community,,the likes of which they had never seen.,Full of women who were as fiercenand as fit as they were,,and as driven to make a difference.,They didn't have to apologizenfor who they were,,and in fact, they could celebrate it.,And what they found when they were therenwas that all of a sudden,,there were lots of people like them.,As one of them said,,"It was like you lookednaround and realized,there was morenthan one giraffe at the zoo." 
 Among this team of standouts was Cassie,,a young woman who managed to benan ROTC cadet, a sorority sister,and a Women's Studies minor,nall in one person.,Tristan, a West Point track star,nwho always ran and road marched,with no socks,,and had shoes whose smell proved it.,(Laughter),Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who hadnalways wanted to be in the infantry,,and when she found outnthat women couldn't be,,she decided to become an intel officer.,She served in Bosnia,,and later helped the FBInto bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.,And then there was Kate,nwho played high school football,all four years,,and actually wanted to drop outnafter the first,,to go into the glee club,,but when boys told hernthat girls couldn't play football,,she decided to stay,for all the little girlsnwho would come after her. 
 For them, biology had shapednpart of their destiny,,and put, as Cassie once said,,"everything noblenout of reach for girls.",And yet, here was a chancento serve with the best of the best,on a mission that matterednto their country,,not despite the factnthat they were female,,but because of it. 
 This team of women, in many ways,nwas like women everywhere.,They wore makeup, and in fact,,they would bond in the ladies' roomnover eyeliner and eye pencil.,They also wore body armor.,They would put 50 poundsnof weight on their backs,,and board the helicopter for an operation,,and they would come back and watchna movie called "Bridesmaids.",(Laughter),They even wore a thing called Spanx,,because, as they found very quickly,,the uniforms made for men werenbig where they should be small,,and small where they should be big.,So Lane, an Iraq War veteran --nyou see her here on my left --,decided she was going to go on Amazon,and order a pair of Spanx to her base,,so that her pants would fit betternwhen she went out on mission each night. 
 These women would get togethernover video conference,from all around Afghanistannfrom their various bases,,and they would talk about what it was like,to be one of the only womenndoing what they were doing.,They would swap jokes,,they would talk aboutnwhat was working, what wasn't,,what they had learned to do well,nwhat they needed to do better.,And they would talk aboutnsome of the lighter moments of being women,out on the Special Operations front lines,,including the Shewee,,which was a toolnthat let you pee like a guy,,although it's said to have had onlyna 40 percent accuracy rate out there.,(Laughter) 
 These women lived in the "and.",They proved you could be fiercenand you could be feminine.,You could wear mascara and body armor.,You could love CrossFit,nand really like cross-stitch.,You could love to climb out of helicoptersnand you could also love to bake cookies.,Women live in the and every single day,,and these women brought thatnto this mission as well.,On this life and death battlefieldnthey never forgot,that being female may have brought themnto the front lines,,but being a soldier is what wouldnprove themselves there. 
 There was the night Amber wentnout on mission,,and in talking to the women of the house,,realized that there wasna barricaded shooter lying in wait,for the Afghan and American forcesnwho were waiting to enter the home.,Another night it was Tristannwho found out,that there were piecesnthat make up explosives,all around the housenin which they were standing,,and that in fact, explosives laynall the way between there,and where they werenabout to head that night.,There was the night another onenof their teammates proved herself,to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,,when she found the intel itemnthey were looking for,wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.,And there was the night that Isabel,nanother one of their teammates,,found the thingsnthat they were looking for,,and received an Impact Awardnfrom the Rangers,who said that without her,,the things and the peoplenthey were looking for that night,would never have been found. 
 That night and so many others,,they went out to prove themselves,nnot only for one another,,but for everybodynwho would come after them.,And also for the mennalongside whom they served.,We talk a lot about hownbehind every great man is a good woman.,And in this case,,next to these women stood mennwho wanted to see them succeed.,The Army Ranger who trained themnhad served 12 deployments.,And when they told himnthat he had to go train girls,,he had no idea what to expect.,But at the end of eight days with thesenwomen in the summer of 2011,,he told his fellow Ranger,n"We have just witnessed history.,These may well benour own Tuskegee Airmen.",(Applause) 
 At the heart of this teamnwas the one person,who everyone called "the best of us.",She was a petite blonde dynamo,,who barely reached five-foot-three.,And she was this wild mixnof Martha Stewart,,and what we know as G.I. Jane.,She was someone who lovednto make dinner for her husband,,her Kent State ROTC sweetheartnwho pushed her to be her best,,and to trust herself,,and to test every limit she could.,She also loved to put 50 pounds of weightnon her back and run for miles,,and she loved to be a soldier.,She was somebody who had a bread makernin her office in Kandahar,,and would bake a batch of raisin bread,nand then go to the gym,and bust out 25 or 30 pull-upsnfrom a dead hang.,She was the person who, if you needednan extra pair of boots,or a home-cooked dinner,nwould be on your speed dial.,Because she never, ever would talk to you,about how good she was,,but let her character speaknthrough action.,She was famous for taking the hard rightnover the easy wrong.,And she was also famousnfor walking up to a 15-foot rope,,climbing it using only her arms,,and then shuffling away and apologizing,,because she knew she was supposednto use both her arms and her legs,,as the Rangers had trained them.,(Laughter) 
 Some of our heroes return homento tell their stories.,And some of them don't.,And on October 22, 2011,,First Lieutenant Ashley White was killednalongside two Rangers,,Christopher Horns,and Kristoffer Domeij.,Her death threw this program builtnfor the shadows,into a very public spotlight.,Because after all,,the ban on women in combatnwas still very much in place.,And at her funeral,,the head of Army Special Operations came,nand gave a public testimony,not just to the courage of Ashley White,,but to all her team of sisters.,"Make no mistake about it," he said,n"these women are warriors,,and they have written a new chapternin what it means to be a female,in the United States Army." 
 Ashley's mom is a teacher's aidenand a school bus driver,,who bakes cookies on the side.,She doesn't remember muchnabout that overwhelming set of days,,in which grief -- enormous grief --,mixed with pride.,But she does remember one moment.,A stranger with a childnin her hand came up to her,and she said, "Mrs. White,,I brought my daughter here today,,because I wanted her to knownwhat a hero was.,And I wanted her to knownthat heroes could be women, too." 
 It is time to celebratenall the unsung heroines,who reach into their guts,and find the heart and the gritnto keep going and to test every limit.,This very unlikely band of sistersnbound forever in life and afterward,did indeed become part of history,,and they paved the way for so manynwho would come after them,,as much as they stood on the shouldersnof those who had come before.,These women showed that warriors comenin all shapes and sizes.,And women can be heroes, too.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)As a matter of fact,,I was trying to think about my careernsince I left the White House,,and the best example I have is a cartoonnin The New Yorker a couple of years ago.,This little boy is looking upnat his father,,and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up,nI want to be a former president." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I have had a great blessingnas a former president,,because I have had an access,that very few other peoplenin the world have ever had,to get to know so many peoplenaround this whole universe.,Not only am I familiarnwith the 50 states in the United States,,but also my wife and I have visitednmore than 145 countries in the world,,and the Carter Center has had full-timenprograms in 80 nations on Earth.,And a lot of times,nwhen we go into a country,,we not only the meetnthe king or the president,,but we also meet the villagers who livenin the most remote areas of Africa. 
 So our overall commitmentnat the Carter Center,is to promote human rights,,and knowing the world as I do,nI can tell you without any equivocation,that the number one abusenof human rights on Earth,is, strangely, not addressed quite often,nis the abuse of women and girls. 
 (Applause) 
 There are a couple of reasons for thisnthat I'll mention to begin with.,First of all is the misinterpretationnof religious scriptures, holy scriptures,,in the Bible, Old Testament,nNew Testament, Quran and so forth,,and these have been misinterpreted by mennwho are now in the ascendant positions,in the synagogues and the churchesnand in the mosques.,And they interpret these rulesnto make sure that women,are ordinarily relegatednto a secondary position,compared to men in the eyes of God. 
 This is a very serious problem.nIt's ordinarily not addressed.,A number of years ago, in the year 2000,,I had been a Baptist,na Southern Baptist for 70 years --,I tell you, I still teachnSunday school every Sunday;,I'll be teaching this Sunday as well --,but the Southern Baptist Conventionnin the year 2000 decided,that women should playna secondary position,,a subservient position to men.,So they issued an edict, in effect,,that prevents women from being priests,npastors, deacons in the church,,or chaplains in the military,,and if a woman teaches a classroom,in a Southern Baptist seminary,,they cannot teach if a boy is in the room,,because you can find verses in the Bible,,there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,,that say that a woman shouldn'tnteach a man, and so forth.,But the basic thing is the scripturesnare misinterpreted,to keep men in an ascendant position.,That is an all-pervasive problem,,because men can exert that power,and if an abusive husband or an employer,nfor instance, wants to cheat women,,they can say that if womennare not equal in the eyes of God,,why should I treat them as equals myself?,Why should I pay them equal paynfor doing the same kind of work? 
 The other very serious blight,that causes this problemnis the excessive resort to violence,,and that is increasingntremendously around the world.,In the United States of America,nfor instance, we have had,an enormous increasenin abuse of poor people,,mostly black people and minorities,nby putting them in prison.,When I was in officenas governor of Georgia,,one out of every 1,000 Americansnwere in prison.,Nowadays, 7.3 peoplenper 1,000 are in prison.,That's a sevenfold increase.,And since I left the White House,,there's been an 800 percent increasenin the number of women,who are black who are in prison.,We also haven[one of the only countries] on Earth,that still has the death penaltynthat is a developed country.,And we rank right alongsidenthe countries that are most abusive,in all elements of human rightsnin encouraging the death penalty.,We're in California now,nand I figured out the other day,that California has spentnfour billion dollars,in convicting 13 peoplenfor the death penalty.,If you add that up, that's 307 millionndollars it costs California,to send a person to be executed.,Nebraska this week just passed a lawnabolishing the death penalty,,because it costs so much. (Applause),So the resort to violence and abusenof poor people and helpless people,is another cause of the increasenin abuse of women. 
 Let me just go down a very fewnabuses of women that concern me most,,and I'll be fairly brief, because I havena limited amount of time, as you know. 
 One is genital mutilation.,Genital mutilation is horriblenand not known by American women,,but in some countries, many countries,,when a child is born that's a girl,nvery soon in her life,,her genitals are completely cut awaynby a so-called cutter,who has a razor blade and,nin a non-sterilized way,,they remove the exterior partsnof a woman's genitalia.,And sometimes, in more extreme casesnbut not very rare cases,,they sew the orifice up so the girlncan just urinate or menstruate.,And then later, when she gets married,nthe same cutter goes in,and opens the orifice upnso she can have sex.,This is not a rare thing, althoughnit's against the law in most countries.,In Egypt, for instance,,91 percent of all the femalesnthat live in Egypt today,have been sexually mutilated in that way.,In some countries,nit's more than 98 percent,of the women are cut that waynbefore they reach maturity.,This is a horrible affliction,on all women that live in those countries. 
 Another very serious thingnis honor killings,,where a family with misinterpretation,nagain, of a holy scripture --,there's nothing in the Qurannthat mandates this --,will execute a girl in their family,if she is raped,or if she marries a mannthat her father does not approve,,or sometimes even if shenwears inappropriate clothing.,And this is done by membersnof her own family,,so the family becomes murderers,when the girl bringsnso-called disgrace to the family.,An analysis was done in Egyptnnot so long ago by the United Nations,and it showed that 75 percentnof these murders of a girl,are perpetrated by the father,nthe uncle or the brother,,but 25 percent of the murdersnare conducted by women. 
 Another problem that we have in the world,that relates to womennparticularly is slavery,,or human trafficking it's called nowadays.,There were about 12.5 million peoplensold from Africa into slavery,in the New World back innthe 19th century and the 18th century.,There are 30 million peoplennow living in slavery.,The United States Department of Statennow has a mandate from Congress,to give a report every year,,and the State Department reportsnthat 800,000 people are sold,across international bordersnevery year into slavery,,and that 80 percentnof those sold are women,,into sexual slavery.,In the United States right this moment,,60,000 people are livingnin human bondage, or slavery.,Atlanta, Georgia, wherenthe Carter Center is located,and where I teach at Emory University,,they have between 200 and 300 women,npeople sold into slavery every month.,It's the number one placenin the nation because of that.,Atlanta has the busiestnairport in the world,,and they also have a lot of passengersnthat come from the Southern Hemisphere.,If a brothel owner,wants to buy a girlnthat has brown or black skin,,they can do it for 1,000 dollars.,A white-skinned girl bringsnseveral times more than that,,and the average brothel owner in Atlantanand in the United States now,can earn about $35,000 per slave.,The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceedsnthe total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.,So this is another very serious problem,nand the basic problem is prostitution,,because there's notna whorehouse in America,that's not known by the local officials,,the local policemen, or the chiefnof police or the mayor and so forth. 
 And this leads to onenof the worst problems,,and that is that women are boughtnincreasingly and put into sexual slavery,in all countries in the world. 
 Sweden has got a good approach to it.,About 15 to 20 years ago, Swedenndecided to change the law,,and women are no longer prosecuted,if they are in sexual slavery,,but the brothel owners and the pimpsnand the male customers are prosecuted,,and -- (Applause) --nprostitution has gone down.,In the United States, we takenjust the opposite position.,For every male arrestednfor illegal sex trade,,25 women are arrestednin the United States of America.,Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,,France, and other countries are moving nowntowards this so-called Swedish model.,That's another thing that can be done. 
 We have two great institutionsnin this country that all of us admire:,our military and our greatnuniversity system.,In the military, they are now analyzingnhow many sexual assaults take place.,The last report I got,nthere were 26,000 sexual assaults,that took place in the military --,26,000.,Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,nare actually prosecuted,,and the reason is that the commandingnofficer of any organization --,a ship like my submarine,nor a battalion in the Army,or a company in the Marines --,the commanding officernhas the right under law to decide,whether to prosecute a rapist or not,,and of course, the last thing they wantnis for anybody to know,that under their command,nsexual assaults are taking place,,so they do not do it.,That law needs to be changed. 
 About one out of four girlsnwho enter American universities,will be sexually assaultednbefore she graduates,,and this is now gettingna lot of publicity,,partially because of my book,nbut other things,,and so 89 universities in Americanare now condemned,by the Department of Educationnunder Title IX,because the officials of the universitiesnare not taking care of the women,to protect them from sexual assault.,The Department of Justice saysnthat more than half of the rapes,on a college campusntake place by serial rapists,,because outside of the university system,,if they rape somebody,nthey'll be prosecuted,,but when they get on a university campus,nthey can rape with impunity.,They're not prosecuted.,Those are the kinds of thingsnthat go on in our society. 
 Another thing that's very seriousnabout the abuse of women and girls,is the lack of equal pay for equal work,,as you know. (Applause),And this is sometimes misinterpreted,nbut for full-time employment,,a woman in the United States nowngets 23 percent less than a man.,When I became president,nthe difference was 39 percent.,So we've made some progress,npartially because I was president,and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) --,but in the last 15 years,nthere's been no progress made,,so it's been just about 23nor 24 percent difference,for the last 15 years.,These are the kind of things that go on.,If you take the Fortune 500 companies,,23 of them have women CEOs,,out of 500,,and those CEOs, I need not tell you,,make less on an average,than the other CEOs.,Well, that's what goes on in our country. 
 Another problem with the United States,is we are the most warlikennation on Earth.,We have been to warnwith about 25 different countries,since the Second World War.,Sometimes, we've had soldiersnon the ground fighting.,The other times,nwe've been flying overhead,dropping bombs on people.,Other times, of course, now, we havendrones that attack people and so forth.,We've been at warnwith 25 different countries,or more since the Second World War.,There was four years,nI won't say which ones,,where we didn't --,(Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,nwe didn't launch a missile,,we didn't fire a bullet.,But anyway, those kinds of things,nthe resort to violence,and the misinterpretationnof the holy scriptures,are what causes, are the basic causes,nof abuse of women and girls. 
 There's one more basic causenthat I need not mention,,and that is that in general,nmen don't give a damn.,(Applause)nThat's true.,The average man that might say,nI'm against the abuse of women and girls,quietly accepts the privilegednposition that we occupy,,and this is very similarnto what I knew when I was a child,,when separate but equal had existed.,Racial discrimination, legally,nhad existed for 100 years,,from 1865 at the end of the WarnBetween the States, the Civil War,,all the way up to the 1960s,,when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed,for equal rights.,But during that time,nthere were many white people,that didn't think thatnracial discrimination was okay,,but they stayed quiet,,because they enjoyed the privilegesnof better jobs,,unique access to jury duty,,better schools, and everything else,,and that's the same thingnthat exists today,,because the average mannreally doesn't care.,Even though they say, "I'm againstndiscrimination against girls and women,",they enjoy a privileged position.,And it's very difficult to getnthe majority of men,who control the university system,,the majority of men that controlnthe military system,,the majority of men that controlnthe governments of the world,,and the majority of men that controlnthe great religions. 
 So what is the basic thingnthat we need to do today?,I would say the best thingnthat we could do today,is for the women in the powerful nations,like this one, and where you come from,,Europe and so forth, who have influencenand who have freedom to speak and to act,,need to take the responsibilitynon yourselves,to be more forceful in demanding,an end to racial discriminationnagainst girls and women,all over the world.,The average woman in Egypt,doesn't have much to saynabout her daughters,getting genitally mutilated and so forth.,I didn't even go downnto detail about that.,But I hope that out of this conference,,that every woman here nwill get your husbands to realize,that these abuses on the college campusesnand the military and so forth,and in the future job market,,need to protect your daughtersnand your granddaughters. 
 I have 12 grandchildren,nfour children, and 10 great-grandchildren,,and I think often about them,and about the plight that theynwill face in America,,not only if they lived in Egyptnor a foreign country,,in having equal rights,,and I hope that all of you will join me,in being a champion for womennand girls around the world,and protect their human rights.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)It was November 1, 2002,,my first day as a principal,,but hardly my first daynin the school district of Philadelphia. 
 I graduated fromnPhiladelphia public schools,,and I went on to teachnspecial education for 20 years,in a low-income, low-performing school,in North Philadelphia,,where crime is rampant,and deep poverty isnamong the highest in the nation. 
 Shortly after I walked into my new school,,a huge fight broke out among the girls.,After things were quickly under control,,I immediately called a meeting,in the school's auditorium,to introduce myselfnas the school's new principal.,(Applause) 
 I walked in angry,,a little nervous --,(Laughter) --,but I was determined,to set the tone for my new students.,I started listing as forcefully as I could,my expectations for their behavior,and my expectationsnfor what they would learn in school.,When, all of a sudden,,a girl way in the back of the auditorium,,she stood up,and she said, "Miss!,Miss!",When our eyes locked, she said,,"Why do you keep calling this a school?,This is not a school." 
 In one outburst,,Ashley had expressed what I felt,and never quite was able to articulate,about my own experiencenwhen I attended a low-performing school,in the same neighborhood,nmany, many, many years earlier.,That school was definitely not a school. 
 Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,,I was entering my thirdnlow-performing school as principal.,I was to be Strawberry Mansion'snfourth principal in four years.,It was labeled "low-performingnand persistently dangerous",due to its low test scores,and high number of weapons,,drugs, assaults and arrests.,Shortly as I approached the doornof my new school,and attempted to enter,,and found the door locked with chains,,I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears,going, "Miss! Miss!,This is not a school.",The halls were dim and darknfrom poor lighting.,There were tons of pilesnof broken old furniture,and desks in the classrooms,,and there were thousandsnof unused materials and resources.,This was not a school.,As the year progressed,,I noticed that the classroomsnwere nearly empty.,The students were just scared:,scared to sit in rows in fearnthat something would happen;,scared because they were often teasednin the cafeteria for eating free food.,They were scared from all the fightingnand all the bullying.,This was not a school. 
 And then, there were the teachers,,who were incredibly afraidnfor their own safety,,so they had low expectationsnfor the students and themselves,,and they were totallynunaware of their role,in the destructionnof the school's culture.,This was the most troubling of all.,You see, Ashley was right,,and not just about her school.,For far too many schools,,for kids who live in poverty,,their schools are reallynnot schools at all.,But this can change.,Let me tell you how it's being donenat Strawberry Mansion High School.,Anybody who's ever workednwith me will tell you,I am known for my slogans.,(Laughter),So today, I am going to use three,that have been paramountnin our quest for change. 
 My first slogan is:,if you're going to lead, lead.,I always believed,that what happens in a schoolnand what does not happen in a school,is up to the principal.,I am the principal,,and having that title required me to lead.,I was not going to stay in my office,,I was not going to delegate my work,,and I was not going to be afraidnto address anything,that was not good for children,,whether that made me liked or not.,I am a leader,,so I know I cannot do anything alone.,So, I assembledna top-notch leadership team,who believed in the possibilitynof all the children,,and together, we tackled the small things,,like resetting every singlenlocker combination by hand,so that every studentncould have a secure locker.,We decorated everynbulletin board in that building,with bright, colorful,nand positive messages.,We took the chains offnthe front doors of the school.,We got the lightbulbs replaced,,and we cleanednevery classroom to its core,,recycling every, every textbooknthat was not needed,,and discarded thousandsnof old materials and furniture.,We used two dumpsters per day. 
 And, of course, of course,,we tackled the big stuff,,like rehauling the entire school budget,so that we can reallocate fundsnto have more teachers and support staff.,We rebuilt the entirenschool day schedule from scratch,to add a variety of start and end times,,remediation, honors courses,,extracurricular activities,nand counseling,,all during the school day.,All during the school day.,We created a deployment plan,that specified where every singlensupport person and police officer would be,every minute of the day,,and we monitorednat every second of the day,,and, our best invention ever,,we devised a schoolwidendiscipline program,titled "Non-negotiables.",It was a behavior system --,designed to promotenpositive behavior at all times. 
 The results?,Strawberry Mansion was removednfrom the Persistently Dangerous List,our first year after being --,(Applause) --,after being on the PersistentlynDangerous List for five consecutive years.,Leaders make the impossible possible. 
 That brings me to my second slogan:,So what? Now what?,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 When we looked at the data,,and we met with the staff,,there were many excuses,for why Strawberry Mansion wasnlow-performing and persistently dangerous.,They said that only 68 percent of the kidsncome to school on a regular basis,,100 percent of them live in poverty,,only one percentnof the parents participate,,many of the children,come from incarcerationnand single-parent homes,,39 percent of the studentsnhave special needs,,and the state data revealed,that six percent of the studentsnwere proficient in algebra,,and 10 were proficient in literature. 
 After they got throughntelling us all the stories,of how awful the conditionsnand the children were,,I looked at them,,and I said, "So what. Now what?,What are we gonna do about it?",(Applause) 
 Eliminating excuses at every turnnbecame my primary responsibility.,We addressed every one of those excuses,through a mandatorynprofessional development,,paving the way for intense focusnon teaching and learning.,After many observations,,what we determined wasnthat teachers knew what to teach,but they did not know how to teach,so many childrennwith so many vast abilities.,So, we developed a lessonndelivery model for instruction,that focused on small group instruction,,making it possible for all the studentsnto get their individual needs met,in the classroom. 
 The results?,After one year, state data revealed,that our scores have grownnby 171 percent in Algebra,and 107 percent in literature.,(Applause),We have a very long way to go,,a very long way to go,,but we now approach every obstaclenwith a "So What. Now What?" attitude. 
 And that brings mento my third and final slogan.,(Laughter),If nobody told you they loved you today,,you remember I do, and I always will. 
 My students have problems:,social, emotional and economic problems,you could never imagine.,Some of them are parents themselves,,and some are completely alone.,If someone asked me my real secret,for how I truly keepnStrawberry Mansion moving forward,,I would have to saynthat I love my students,and I believe in their possibilities,unconditionally.,When I look at them,,I can only see what they can become,,and that is because I am one of them.,I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.,I know what it feels likento go to a school that's not a school.,I know what it feels like to wonder,if there's ever going to benany way out of poverty.,But because of my amazing mother,,I got the ability to dream,despite the poverty that surrounded me. 
 So --,(Applause) --,if I'm going to push my students,toward their dreamnand their purpose in life,,I've got to get to know who they are.,So I have to spend time with them,,so I manage the lunchroom every day.,(Laughter),And while I'm there,,I talk to themnabout deeply personal things,,and when it's their birthday,,I sing "Happy Birthday",even though I cannot sing at all.,(Laughter),I often ask them,,"Why do you want me to singnwhen I cannot sing at all?",(Laughter),And they respond by saying,,"Because we like feeling special." 
 We hold monthly town hall meetings,to listen to their concerns,,to find out what is on their minds.,They ask us questions like,n"Why do we have to follow rules?","Why are there so many consequences?","Why can't we just do what we want to do?",(Laughter),They ask, and I answerneach question honestly,,and this exchange in listeningnhelps to clear up any misconceptions.,Every moment is a teachable moment. 
 My reward,,my reward,for being non-negotiablenin my rules and consequences,is their earned respect.,I insist on it,,and because of this,nwe can accomplish things together.,They are clear aboutnmy expectations for them,,and I repeat those expectationsnevery day over the P.A. system.,I remind them --,(Laughter),I remind them of those core values,of focus, tradition, excellence,,integrity and perseverance,,and I remind them every day,how education can trulynchange their lives.,And I end every announcement the same:,"If nobody told you they loved you today,,you remember I do,,and I always will." 
 Ashley's words,of "Miss, Miss,,this is not a school,",is forever etched in my mind.,If we are truly goingnto make real progress,in addressing poverty,,then we have to make sure,that every schoolnthat serves children in poverty,is a real school,,a school, a school --,(Applause) --,a school that provides them with knowledge,and mental trainingnto navigate the world around them. 
 I do not know all the answers,,but what I do know is for thosenof us who are privileged,and have the responsibility of leadingna school that serves children in poverty,,we must truly lead,,and when we are facednwith unbelievable challenges,,we must stop and ask ourselves,n"So what. Now what?,What are we going to do about it?",And as we lead,,we must never forget,that every single one of our students,is just a child,,often scared by what the worldntells them they should be,,and no matter what the restnof the world tells them they should be,,we should always provide them with hope,,our undivided attention,,unwavering belief in their potential,,consistent expectations,,and we must tell them often,,if nobody told them they loved them today,,remember we do, and we always will. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, Jesus.I'll begin today,by sharing a poem,written by my friend from Malawi,,Eileen Piri.,Eileen is only 13 years old,,but when we were going throughnthe collection of poetry that we wrote,,I found her poem so interesting,,so motivating.,So I'll read it to you.,She entitled her poemn"I'll Marry When I Want.",(Laughter) 
 "I'll marry when I want.,My mother can't force me to marry.,My father cannot force me to marry.,My uncle, my aunt,,my brother or sister,,cannot force me to marry.,No one in the world,can force me to marry.,I'll marry when I want.,Even if you beat me,,even if you chase me away,,even if you do anything bad to me,,I'll marry when I want. 
 I'll marry when I want,,but not before I am well educated,,and not before I am all grown up. 
 I'll marry when I want." 
 This poem might seem odd,,written by a 13-year-old girl,,but where I and Eileen come from,,this poem, which I have just read to you,,is a warrior's cry. 
 I am from Malawi.,Malawi is one of the poorest countries,,very poor,,where gender equality is questionable. 
 Growing up in that country,,I couldn't make my own choices in life.,I couldn't even explore,personal opportunities in life. 
 I will tell you a story,of two different girls,,two beautiful girls.,These girls grew up,under the same roof.,They were eating the same food.,Sometimes, they would share clothes,,and even shoes.,But their lives ended up differently,,in two different paths.,The other girl is my little sister.,My little sister was only 11 years old,when she got pregnant.,It's a hurtful thing.,Not only did it hurt her, even me.,I was going through a hard time as well. 
 As it is in my culture,,once you reach puberty stage,,you are supposed to gonto initiation camps.,In these initiation camps,,you are taught hownto sexually please a man.,There is this special day,,which they call "Very Special Day",where a man who is hirednby the community,comes to the camp,and sleeps with the little girls.,Imagine the trauma that these young girls,go through every day.,Most girls end up pregnant.,They even contract HIV and AIDS,and other sexually transmitted diseases. 
 For my little sister,nshe ended up being pregnant.,Today, she's only 16 years old,and she has three children.,Her first marriage did not survive,,nor did her second marriage. 
 On the other side, there is this girl.,She's amazing.,(Laughter),(Applause),I call her amazing because she is.,She's very fabulous.,That girl is me. (Laughter),When I was 13 years old,,I was told, you are grown up,,you have now reached of age,,you're supposed to gonto the initiation camp.,I was like, "What?,I'm not going to gonto the initiation camps.",You know what the women said to me?,"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.,You do not respect the traditionsnof our society, of our community." 
 I said no because I knewnwhere I was going.,I knew what I wanted in life.,I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.,I wanted to get well educated,,to find a decent job in the future.,I was imagining myself as a lawyer,,seated on that big chair.,Those were the imaginations that,were going through my mind every day.,And I knew that one day,,I would contribute something,na little something to my community.,But every day after refusing,,women would tell me,,"Look at you, you're all grown up.nYour little sister has a baby.,What about you?",That was the musicnthat I was hearing every day,,and that is the musicnthat girls hear every day,when they don't do somethingnthat the community needs them to do. 
 When I compared the two storiesnbetween me and my sister,,I said, "Why can't I do something?,Why can't I change somethingnthat has happened for a long time,in our community?" 
 That was when I called other girls,just like my sister, who have children,,who have been in class but they havenforgotten how to read and write.,I said, "Come on, we can nremind each other,how to read and write again,,how to hold the pen,nhow to read, to hold the book.",It was a great time I had with them.,Nor did I just learn a little about them,,but they were able to tell mentheir personal stories,,what they were facing every day,as young mothers.,That was when I was like,,'Why can't we take all these thingsnthat are happening to us,and present them and tell our mothers,nour traditional leaders,,that these are the wrong things?",It was a scary thing to do,,because these traditional leaders,,they are already accustomed to the things,that have been there for ages.,A hard thing to change,,but a good thing to try. 
 So we tried.,It was very hard, but we pushed.,And I'm here to say that in my community,,it was the first community after girls,pushed so hard to our traditional leader,,and our leader stood up for usnand said no girl has to be married,before the age of 18.,(Applause) 
 In my community,,that was the first time a community,,they had to call the bylaws,,the first bylaw that protected girls,in our community. 
 We did not stop there.,We forged ahead.,We were determined to fight for girlsnnot just in my community,,but even in other communities.,When the child marriage billnwas being presented in February,,we were there at the Parliament house.,Every day, when the membersnof Parliament were entering,,we were telling them,n"Would you please support the bill?",And we don't havenmuch technology like here,,but we have our small phones.,So we said, "Why can't we get ntheir numbers and text them?",So we did that. It was a good thing.,(Applause),So when the bill passed,nwe texted them back,,"Thank you for supporting the bill.",(Laughter),And when the bill was signednby the president,,making it into law, it was a plus.,Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legalnmarriage age, from 15 to 18.,(Applause) 
 It's a good thing to knownthat the bill passed,,but let me tell you this:,There are countries where 18nis the legal marriage age,,but don't we hear criesnof women and girls every day?,Every day, girls' livesnare being wasted away.,This is high time for leadersnto honor their commitment.,In honoring this commitment,,it means keeping girls' issuesnat heart every time.,We don't have to be subjected as second,,but they have to know that women,nas we are in this room,,we are not just women,nwe are not just girls,,we are extraordinary.,We can do more. 
 And another thing for Malawi,,and not just Malawi but other countries:,The laws which are there,,you know how a law is not a lawnuntil it is enforced?,The law which has just recently passed,and the laws that in other countriesnhave been there,,they need to be publicizednat the local level,,at the community level,,where girls' issues are very striking.,Girls face issues, difficult issues,nat the community level every day.,So if these young girls knownthat there are laws that protect them,,they will be able to stand upnand defend themselves,because they will know thatnthere is a law that protects them. 
 And another thing I would say is that,girls' voices and women's voices,are beautiful, they are there,,but we cannot do this alone.,Male advocates, they have to jump in,,to step in and work together.,It's a collective work.,What we need is what girls elsewhere need:,good education, and above all,nnot to marry whilst 11. 
 And furthermore,,I know that together,,we can transform the legal,,the cultural and political framework,that denies girls of their rights.,I am standing here today,and declaring that we cannend child marriage in a generation.,This is the moment,where a girl and a girl,nand millions of girls worldwide,,will be able to say,,"I will marry when I want." 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)For the last 50 years,,a lot of smart, well-resourced people --nsome of you, no doubt --,have been trying to figure outnhow to reduce poverty,in the United States.,People have created and investednmillions of dollars,into non-profit organizations,with the mission of helpingnpeople who are poor. 
 They've created think tanks,that study issues like education,njob creation and asset-building,,and then advocated for policies to supportnour most marginalized communities.,They've written books and columnsnand given passionate speeches,,decrying the wealth gapnthat is leaving more and more people,entrenched at the bottom endnof the income scale.,And that effort has helped.,But it's not enough.,Our poverty rates haven't changednthat much in the last 50 years,,since the War on Poverty was launched.,I'm here to tell you,that we have overlookednthe most powerful and practical resource.,Here it is:,people who are poor. 
 Up in the left-hand cornernis Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.,They met when they all had small children,,through a parenting classnat a family resource center,in San Francisco.,As they grew togethernas parents and friends,,they talked a lot about how hard it was,to make money when your kids are little.,Child care is expensive,,more than they'd earn in a job.,Their husbands worked,,but they wanted to contributenfinancially, too. 
 So they hatched a plan.,They started a cleaning business.,They plastered neighborhoods with flyers,and handed business cards outnto their families and friends,,and soon, they had clients calling.,Two of them would cleannthe office or house,and one of them would watch the kids.,They'd rotate who'd cleanednand who'd watch the kids.,(Laughs) It's awesome, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 And they split the money three ways.,It was not a full-time gig,,no one could watchnthe little ones all day.,But it made a differencenfor their families.,Extra money to pay for billsnwhen a husband's work hours were cut.,Money to buy the kids clothesnas they were growing.,A little extra money in their pockets,to make them feel some independence. 
 Up in the top-right cornernis Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.,Brianna is one of those kids,with this sparkly, infectious,noutgoing personality.,For example, when Rosie,,a little girl who spoke only Spanish,nmoved in next door,,Brianna, who spoke only English,,borrowed her mother's tabletnand found a translation app,so the two of them could communicate. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know, right?,Rosie's family credits Briannanwith helping Rosie to learn English. 
 A few years ago,,Brianna started to struggle academically.,She was growing frustratednand kind of withdrawn,and acting out in class.,And her mother was heartbrokennover what was happening.,Then they found out that she was goingnto have to repeat second grade,and Brianna was devastated.,Her mother felt hopelessnand overwhelmed and alone,because she knew that her daughternwas not getting the support she needed,,and she did not know how to help her.,One afternoon, Theresa was catching upnwith a group of friends,,and one of them said,,"Theresa, how are you?",And she burst into tears.,After she shared her story,none of her friends said,,"I went through the exact same thingnwith my son about a year ago.",And in that moment,,Theresa realizednthat so much of her struggle,was not having anybodynto talk with about it.,So she created a support groupnfor parents like her.,The first meeting was hernand two other people.,But word spread, and soonn20 people, 30 people,were showing up for thesenmonthly meetings that she put together.,She went from feeling helpless,to realizing how capable she wasnof supporting her daughter,,with the support of other peoplenwho were going through the same struggle.,And Brianna is doing fantastic --nshe's doing great academically,and socially. 
 That in the middle is my man Baakir,,standing in front ofnBlackStar Books and Caffe,,which he runs out of part of his house.,As you walk in the door,,Baakir greets younwith a "Welcome black home." 
 (Laughter) 
 Once inside, you can ordernsome Algiers jerk chicken,,perhaps a vegan walnut burger,,or jive turkey sammich.,And that's sammich -- not sandwich.,You must finish your mealnwith a buttermilk drop,,which is several steps above a donut hole,and made from a very secret family recipe.,For real, it's very secret,nhe won't tell you about it. 
 But BlackStar is much more than a café.,For the kids in the neighborhood,,it's a place to go after schoolnto get help with homework.,For the grown-ups, it's where they go,to find out what's going onnin the neighborhood,and catch up with friends.,It's a performance venue.,It's a home for poets,nmusicians and artists.,Baakir and his partner Nicole,,with their baby girl strapped to her back,,are there in the mix of it all,,serving up a cup of coffee,,teaching a child how to play Mancala,,or painting a signnfor an upcoming community event. 
 I have worked with and learnednfrom people just like them,for more than 20 years.,I have organizednagainst the prison system,,which impacts poor folks,,especially black, indigenousnand Latino folks,,at an alarming rate.,I have worked with young peoplenwho manifest hope and promise,,despite being at the effect of racistndiscipline practices in their schools,,and police violence in their communities.,I have learned from families,who are unleashingntheir ingenuity and tenacity,to collectively createntheir own solutions.,And they're not just focused on money.,They're addressing education,nhousing, health, community --,the things that we all care about.,Everywhere I go,,I see people who are broke but not broken.,I see people who are strugglingnto realize their good ideas,,so that they can createna better life for themselves,,their families, their communities.,Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresanand Baakir are the rule,,not the shiny exception.,I am the exception. 
 I was raised by a quietly fiercensingle mother in Rochester, New York.,I was bussed to a schoolnin the suburbs, from a neighborhood,that many of my classmatesnand their parents considered dangerous.,At eight, I was a latchkey kid.,I'd get myself home after school every daynand do homework and chores,,and wait for my mother to come home.,After school, I'd go to the corner store,and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,,which I'd heat up on the stovenas my afternoon snack.,If I had a little extra money,nI'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Cherry.,Not as good as a buttermilk drop. 
 (Laughter) 
 We were poor when I was a kid.,But now, I own a homenin a quickly gentrifying neighborhood,in Oakland, California.,I've built a career.,My husband is a business owner.,I have a retirement account.,My daughter is not even allowednto turn on the stove,unless there's a grown-up at home,and she doesn't have to,,because she does not have to haventhe same kind of self-reliance,that I had to at her age.,My kids' raviolis are organic,and full of thingsnlike spinach and ricotta,,because I have the luxury of choice,when it comes to what my children eat. 
 I am the exception,,not because I'm more talented than Baakir,or my mother worked any hardernthan Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,,or cared any more than Theresa.,Marginalized communities are fullnof smart, talented people,,hustling and working and innovating,,just like our most reverednand most rewarded CEOs.,They are full of peoplentapping into their resilience,to get up every day,nget the kids off to school,and go to jobs that don't pay enough,,or get educationsnthat are putting them in debt.,They are full of people applyingntheir savvy intelligence,to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,,or balance a job and a side hustlento make ends meet.,They are full of peoplendoing for themselves and for others,,whether it's picking up medicationnfor an elderly neighbor,,or letting a sibling borrow some moneynto pay the phone bill,,or just watching outnfor the neighborhood kids,from the front stoop. 
 I am the exceptionnbecause of luck and privilege,,not hard work.,And I'm not being modestnor self-deprecating --,I am amazing. 
 (Laughter) 
 But most people work hard.,Hard work is the commonndenominator in this equation,,and I'm tired of the story we tell,that hard work leads to success,,because that allows -- 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 ... because that story allows those of usnwho make it to believe we deserve it,,and by implication,,those who don't make it don't deserve it.,We tell ourselves,nin the back of our minds,,and sometimes in the front of our mouths,,"There must be something a little wrongnwith those poor people.",We have a wide range of beliefs,about what that something wrong is.,Some people tell the storynthat poor folks are lazy freeloaders,who would cheat and liento get out of an honest day's work.,Others prefer the storynthat poor people are helpless,and probably had neglectful parentsnthat didn't read to them enough,,and if they were just told what to do,and shown the right path,,they could make it. 
 For every story I hear demonizingnlow-income single mothers,or absentee fathers,,which is how peoplenmight think of my parents,,I've got 50 that tell a different storynabout the same people,,showing up every day and doing their best.,I'm not saying that somenof the negative stories aren't true,,but those stories allow usnto not really see who people really are,,because they don't paint a full picture.,The quarter-truths and limitednplot lines have us convinced,that poor people are a problemnthat needs fixing.,What if we recognizednthat what's working is the people,and what's broken is our approach?,What if we realized that the expertsnwe are looking for,,the experts we need to follow,,are poor people themselves?,What if, instead of imposing solutions,,we just added fire,to the already-burning flamenthat they have?,Not directing --,not even empowering --,but just fueling their initiative. 
 Just north of here,,we have an examplenof what this could look like:,Silicon Valley.,A whole venture capital industrynhas grown up around the belief,that if people have good ideasnand the desire to manifest them,,we should give them lotsnand lots and lots of money. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? But where is our strategynfor Theresa and Baakir?,There are no incubators for them,,no accelerators, no fellowships.,How are Jobana, Sintia and Berthanreally all that different,from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?,Baakir has experience and a track record.,I'd put my money on him. 
 So, consider this an invitationnto rethink a flawed strategy.,Let's grasp this opportunity,to let go of a tired, faulty narrative,and listen and look for true stories,,more beautifully complex stories,,about who marginalized peoplenand families and communities are. 
 I'm going to take a minutento speak to my people.,We cannot wait,for somebody else to get it right.,Let us remember what we are capable of;,all that we have builtnwith blood, sweat and dreams;,all the cogs that keep turning;,and the people kept afloatnbecause of our backbreaking work.,Let us remember that we are magic.,If you need some inspirationnto jog your memory,,read Octavia Butler'sn"Parable of the Sower.",Listen to Reverend King'sn"Letter from Birmingham Jail.",Listen to Suheir Hammad reciten"First Writing Since,",or Esperanza Spaldingnperform "Black Gold.",Set your gaze upon the artnof Kehinde Wiley,or Favianna Rodriguez.,Look at the hands of your grandmother,or into the eyes of someone who loves you.,We are magic.,Individually, we don't havena lot of wealth and power,,but collectively, we are unstoppable.,And we spend a lot of our time and energy,organizing our power to demand changenfrom systems that were not made for us.,Instead of trying to alternthe fabric of existing ways,,let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.,Let's use some of ournsubstantial collective power,toward inventing and bringing to life,new ways of being that work for us. 
 Desmond Tutu talksnabout the concept of ubuntu,,in the context of South Africa'snTruth and Reconciliation process,that they embarked on after apartheid.,He says it means,,"My humanity is caught up,nis inextricably bound up, in yours;,we belong to a bundle of life.",A bundle of life.,The Truth and Reconciliation process,started by elevatingnthe voices of the unheard.,If this country is going to live up to itsnpromise of liberty and justice for all,,then we need to elevatenthe voices of our unheard,,of people like Jobana,nSintia and Bertha,,Theresa and Baakir.,We must leverage their solutionsnand their ideas.,We must listen to their true stories,,their more beautifully complex stories. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here to recruit mennto support gender equality. 
 (Cheers) 
 Wait, wait. What?,What do men have to donwith gender equality?,Gender equality is about women, right?,I mean, the word gender is about women.,Actually, I'm even here speakingnas a middle class white man. 
 Now, I wasn't alwaysna middle class white man.,It all happened for me about 30 years agonwhen I was in graduate school,,and a bunch of us graduate studentsngot together one day,,and we said, you know,nthere's an explosion,of writing and thinkingnin feminist theory,,but there's no courses yet.,So we did what graduate studentsntypically do in a situation like that.,We said, OK, let's have a study group.,We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,,we'll have a potluck dinner. 
 (Laughter) 
 So every week,n11 women and me got together. 
 (Laughter) 
 We would read some text in feminist theorynand have a conversation about it.,And during one of our conversations,,I witnessed an interactionnthat changed my life forever.,It was a conversation between two women.,One of the women was white,nand one was black.,And the white woman said --,this is going to soundnvery anachronistic now --,the white woman said, "All womennface the same oppression as women.,All women are similarlynsituated in patriarchy,,and therefore all women have a kindnof intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.",And the black woman said,n"I'm not so sure.,Let me ask you a question.",So the black womannsays to the white woman,,"When you wake up in the morningnand you look in the mirror,,what do you see?",And the white woman said, "I see a woman.",And the black woman said,n"You see, that's the problem for me.,Because when I wake up in the morningnand I look in the mirror," she said,,"I see a black woman.,To me, race is visible. But to you,nrace is invisible. You don't see it.",And then she saidnsomething really startling.,She said, "That's how privilege works.,Privilege is invisiblento those who have it.",It is a luxury, I will saynto the white people sitting in this room,,not to have to think about racenevery split second of our lives.,Privilege is invisiblento those who have it. 
 Now remember, I wasnthe only man in this group,,so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no." 
 (Laughter) 
 And somebody said,n"Well what was that reaction?",And I said, "Well, when I wake upnin the morning and I look in the mirror,,I see a human being.,I'm kind of the generic person.,You know, I'm a middle class white man.nI have no race, no class, no gender.,I'm universally generalizable." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I like to think that was the momentnI became a middle class white man,,that class and race and gendernwere not about other people,,they were about me.,I had to start thinking about them,,and it had been privilege that hadnkept it invisible to me for so long. 
 Now, I wish I could tell younthis story ends 30 years ago,in that little discussion group,,but I was reminded of it quite recentlynat my university where I teach.,I have a colleague, and she and Inboth teach the sociology of gender course,on alternate semesters.,So she gives a guest lecturenfor me when I teach.,I give a guest lecturenfor her when she teaches.,So I walk into her classnto give a guest lecture,,about 300 students in the room,,and as I walk in, one of the studentsnlooks up and says,,"Oh, finally, an objective opinion." 
 All that semester, whenevernmy colleague opened her mouth,,what my students saw was a woman.,I mean, if you were to say to my students,,"There is structural inequalitynbased on gender in the United States,",they'd say, "Well of coursenyou'd say that.,You're a woman. You're biased.",When I say it, they go,n"Wow, is that interesting.,Is that going to be on the test?nHow do you spell 'structural'?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So I hope you all can see,,this is what objectivity looks like. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Disembodied Western rationality. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that, by the way, is why I thinknmen so often wear ties. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because if you are going to embodyndisembodied Western rationality,,you need a signifier,,and what could be a better signifiernof disembodied Western rationality,than a garment that at one end is a noosenand the other end points to the genitals? 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 That is mind-body dualism right there. 
 So making gender visible to men,is the first step to engaging mennto support gender equality. 
 Now, when men first hearnabout gender equality,,when they first start thinking about it,,they often think, many men think,,well, that's right,nthat's fair, that's just,,that's the ethical imperative.,But not all men.,Some men think --nthe lightning bolt goes off,,and they go, "Oh my God,nyes, gender equality,",and they will immediately beginnto mansplain to you your oppression.,They see supporting gender equalitynsomething akin to the cavalry,,like, "Thanks very much for bringing thisnto our attention, ladies,,we'll take it from here.",This results in a syndrome that I likento call 'premature self-congratulation.' 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 There's another group, though,nthat actively resists gender equality,,that sees gender equalitynas something that is detrimental to men.,I was on a TV talk shownopposite four white men.,This is the beginning of the booknI wrote, 'Angry White Men.',These were four angry white men,who believed that they,nwhite men in America,,were the victims of reverse discriminationnin the workplace.,And they all told storiesnabout how they were qualified for jobs,,qualified for promotions,,they didn't get them,nthey were really angry.,And the reason I'm telling you thisnis I want you to hear the title,of this particular show.,It was a quote from one of the men,,and the quote was,,"A Black Woman Stole My Job.",And they all told their stories,,qualified for jobs,nqualified for promotions,,didn't get it, really angry.,And then it was my turn to speak,,and I said, "I havenjust one question for you guys,,and it's about the title of the show,,'A Black Woman Stole My Job.',Actually, it's aboutnone word in the title.,I want to know about the word 'my.',Where did you get the ideanit was your job?,Why isn't the title of the show,n'A Black Woman Got the Job?',or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'",Because without confrontingnmen's sense of entitlement,,I don't think we'll ever understandnwhy so many men resist gender equality. 
 (Applause) 
 Look, we think thisnis a level playing field,,so any policy that tilts itneven a little bit,,we think, "Oh my God,nwater's rushing uphill.,It's reverse discrimination against us." 
 (Laughter) 
 So let me be very clear:,white men in Europe and the United States,are the beneficiaries of the singlengreatest affirmative action program,in the history of the world.,It is called "the history of the world." 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 So, now I've establishednsome of the obstacles to engaging men,,but why should we support gender equality?,Of course, it's fair,nit's right and it's just.,But more than that,,gender equality is alsonin our interest as men.,If you listen to what men saynabout what they want in their lives,,gender equality is actually a waynfor us to get the lives we want to live. 
 Gender equality is good for countries.,It turns out, according to most studies,,that those countriesnthat are the most gender equal,are also the countries that score highestnon the happiness scale.,And that's not just becausenthey're all in Europe. 
 (Laughter) 
 Even within Europe, those countriesnthat are more gender equal,also have the highest levels of happiness. 
 It is also good for companies.,Research by Catalyst and othersnhas shown conclusively,that the more gender-equal companies are,,the better it is for workers,,the happier their labor force is.,They have lower job turnover.nThey have lower levels of attrition.,They have an easier time recruiting.,They have higher rates of retention,nhigher job satisfaction,,higher rates of productivity.,So the question I'm often askednin companies is,,"Boy, this gender equality thing,nthat's really going to be expensive, huh?",And I say, "Oh no, in fact,nwhat you have to start calculating,is how much gender inequalitynis already costing you.,It is extremely expensive.",So it is good for business. 
 And the other thing is, it's good for men.,It is good for the kind of livesnwe want to live,,because young men especiallynhave changed enormously,,and they want to have livesnthat are animated,by terrific relationshipsnwith their children.,They expect their partners,ntheir spouses, their wives,,to work outside the home,and be just as committednto their careers as they are. 
 I was talking, to give younan illustration of this change --,Some of you may remember this.,When I was a lot younger,nthere was a riddle that was posed to us.,Some of you may wincento remember this riddle.,This riddle went something like this. 
 A man and his sonnare driving on the freeway,,and they're in a terrible accident,,and the father is killed,,and the son is broughtnto the hospital emergency room,,and as they're bringing the sonninto the hospital emergency room,,the emergency room attending physiciannsees the boy and says,,"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son.",How is this possible? 
 We were flummoxed by this.,We could not figure this out. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I decided to do a little experimentnwith my 16-year old son.,He had a bunch of his friendsnhanging out at the house,watching a game on TV recently.,So I decided I would posenthis riddle to them,,just to see, to gauge the level of change.,Well, 16-year-old boys,,they immediately turned to menand said, "It's his mom." Right?,No problem. Just like that.,Except for my son, who said,n"Well, he could have two dads." 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 That's an index, an indicatornof how things have changed.,Younger men today expectnto be able to balance work and family.,They want to be dual-career,ndual-carer couples.,They want to be able to balancenwork and family with their partners.,They want to be involved fathers. 
 Now, it turns out,that the more egalitariannour relationships,,the happier both partners are.,Data from psychologists and sociologistsnare quite persuasive here.,I think we have the persuasive numbers,nthe data, to prove to men,that gender equalitynis not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.,Here's what the data show.,Now, when men beginnthe process of engaging,with balancing work and family,,we often have two phrasesnthat we use to describe what we do.,We pitch in and we help out. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm going to proposensomething a little bit more radical,,one word: "share." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because here's what the data show:,when men share housework and childcare,,their children do better in school.,Their children have lower ratesnof absenteeism,,higher rates of achievement.,They are less likelynto be diagnosed with ADHD.,They are less likelynto see a child psychiatrist.,They are less likelynto be put on medication. 
 So when men share housework and childcare,,their children are happier and healthier,,and men want this. 
 When men share housework and childcare,,their wives are happier. Duh.,Not only that, their wives are healthier.,Their wives are less likelynto see a therapist,,less likely to be diagnosednwith depression,,less likely to be put on medication,nmore likely to go to the gym,,report higher levelsnof marital satisfaction.,So when men share housework and childcare,,their wives are happier and healthier,,and men certainly want this as well.,When men share housework and childcare,,the men are healthier.,They smoke less, drink less,ntake recreational drugs less often.,They are less likely to go to the ER,but more like to go to a doctornfor routine screenings.,They are less likely to see a therapist,,less likely to be diagnosednwith depression,,less likely to be takingnprescription medication.,So when men share housework and childcare,,the men are happier and healthier.,And who wouldn't want that? 
 And finally,,when men share housework and childcare,,they have more sex. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, of these four fascinating findings,,which one do you thinknMen's Health magazine put on its cover? 
 (Laughter) 
 "Housework Makes Her Horny.,(Not When She Does It.)" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I will say,,just to remind the men in the audience,,these data were collectednover a really long period of time,,so I don't want listeners to say,,"Hmm, OK, I thinknI'll do the dishes tonight.",These data were collectednover a really long period of time.,But I think it shows something important,,that when Men's Health magazinenput it on their cover,,they also called,nyou'll love this, "Choreplay." 
 So, what we foundnis something really important,,that gender equality,is in the interest of countries,,of companies, and of men,,and their children and their partners,,that gender equalitynis not a zero-sum game.,It's not a win-lose.,It is a win-win for everyone.,And what we also know,is we cannot fully empower women and girls,unless we engage boys and men.,We know this.,And my position is,that men need the very thingsnthat women have identified,that they need to live the livesnthey say they want to live,in order to live the livesnthat we say we want to live. 
 In 1915, on the eve of onenof the great suffrage demonstrations,down Fifth Avenue in New York City,,a writer in New Yorknwrote an article in a magazine,,and the title of the article was,,"Feminism for Men.",And this was the first linenof that article:,"Feminism will make it possiblenfor the first time for men to be free." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was only three or four,,I fell in love with poetry,,with the rhythmsnand the music of language;,with the power of metaphor and of imagery,,poetry being the essencenof communication --,the discipline, the distillation.,And all these years later,nthe poems I'll read today,are from my just-finishednseventh book of poetry. 
 Well, five years ago, I was diagnosednwith Parkinson's disease.,Though there's no cure yet,,advances in treatmentnare really impressive.,But you can imaginenthat I was appalled to learn,that women are largelynleft out of research trials,,despite gender-specificnmedical findings having demonstrated,that we are not actually just small men -- 
 (Laughter) 
 who happen to havendifferent reproductive systems.,Gender-specific medicinenis good for men, too. 
 But you bring to a crisisnthe person you already are,,including the, yes, momentumnthat you've learned to invoke,through passionate caringnand through action,,both of which requirenbut also create energy.,So as an activist, I began workingnwith the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --,that's pdf.org --,to create a major initiative to put womennon the Parkinson's disease map.,And as a poet, I began workingnwith this subject matter,,finding it tragic, hilarious,nsometimes even joyful.,I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;,I feel distilled by it,,and I actually very muchnlike the woman I'm distilling into. 
 "No Signs of Struggle" 
 Growing small requires enormity of will:,just sitting stillnin the doctor's waiting room,watching the future shuffle in and out,,watching it stoop; stare at you,while you try not to look.,Rare is an exchange:,a smile of brief, wry recognition. 
 You are the new kid on the block.,Everyone here was you once.,You are still learning that growing smallnrequires a largeness of spirit,you can't fit into yet:,acceptance of irritating helpnfrom those who love you;,giving way and over, but not up. 
 You've swallowed hard the contentsnof the "Drink Me" bottle,,and felt yourself shrink.,Now, familiar furniture looms,,floors tilt, and doorknobs yield onlynwhen wrestled round with both hands.,It demands colossal patience,nall this growing small:,your diminished sleep at night,,your handwriting, your voice, your height. 
 You are more the incrediblenshrinking woman,than the Buddhist mystic,nserene, making do with less.,Less is not always more.,Yet in this emptying space,nspace glimmers,,becoming visible.,Here is a place behind the eyesnof those accustomed,by what some would call diminishment. 
 It is a place of merciless poetry,,a gift of presence previously ignored,,drowned in the daily clutter.,Here every gesture needs intention,,is alive with consciousness.,Nothing is automatic. 
 You can spot itnin the provocation of a button,,an arm poking at a sleeve,,a balancing act at a night-time curbnwhile negotiating the dark.,Feats of such modest valor,,who would suspect them to be exercisesnin an intimate, fierce discipline,,a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware? 
 Such understated power here,,in these tottering dancersnwho exert stupendous effort,on tasks most view as insignificant.,Such quiet beauty here, in these,,my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;,such resolve masked by each placid face.,There is immensity requirednin growing small,,so bent on such unbending grace. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 This one is calledn"On Donating My Brain to Science." 
 (Laughter) 
 Not a problem.,Skip over all the pagesnreassuring religious people.,Already a universal donor:nkidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,,tissue, heart, veins, whatever. 
 Odd that the modest brain nevernimagined its unique value in research,,maybe saving someone else from what it isnthey're not quite sure I have.,Flattering, that. 
 So fill in the forms,,drill through the answers,,trill out a blithe spirit. 
 And slice me, dice me,nspread me on your slides.,Find what I'm trying to tell you. 
 Earn me, learn me, scan me,nsquint through your lens.,Uncover what I'd hint at if I could. 
 Be my guest, do your best,nharvest me, track the clues.,This was a good brain while alive.,This was a brain that paid its dues. 
 So slice me, dice me,nsmear me on your slides,,stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.,Share me, hear me: 
 I want to be usednI want to be used,I want to be usednup. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 And this one's called "The Ghost Light." 
 Lit from within is the sole secure way,to traverse dark matter.,Some life forms -- certain mushrooms,nsnails, jellyfish, worms --,glow bioluminescent,,and people as well;,we emit infra-red lightnfrom our most lucent selves.,Our tragedy is we can't see it. 
 We see by reflecting.,We need biofluorescencento show our true colors.,External illumination can distort, though.,When gravity bends light,,huge galaxy clustersncan act as telescopes,,elongating background imagesnof star systems to faint arcs --,a lensing effect,like viewing distant street lampsnthrough a glass of wine. 
 A glass of wine or two now makes me weave,as if acting the drunkard's part;,as if, besotted with unrequited love,for the dynamic Turner canvassesnspied out by the Hubble,,I could lurch down a city street set,without provokingnevery pedestrian walk-on stare. 
 Stare as long as you need to.,If you think about it, walking,neven standing, is illogical --,such tiny things, feet! -- 
 (Laughter) 
 especially when one's bodynis not al dente anymore. 
 (Laughter) 
 Besides, creature of extremes and excess,,I've always thought Apollonbeautiful but boring,,and a bit of a dumb blonde.,Dionysians don't do balance. 
 Balance, in other words,nhas never been my strong point.,But I digress.,More and more these days,,digression seemsnthe most direct route through,from where I've lost or found myself,out of place, mind, turn, time. 
 Place your foot just so,nmind how you turn:,too swift a swivel can bring you down.,Take your time ushering the audience out,,saying goodbye to the actors.,The ghost light,is what they call the single bulb,hanging above the bare stagenin an empty theater. 
 In the empty theater of such a night,,waking to meet no external radiance,,this is the final struggle left to win,,this the sole beaconnto beckon the darkness in,and let the rest begin,,this the lens through which at lastnto see both Self and Other,arrayed with the bright stainnof original sin:,lit from within. 
 (Applause) 
 And this is the last one. 
 "This Dark Hour" 
 Late summer, 4 A.M.,The rain slows to a stop,,dripping still from the broad leaves,of blue hostas unseennin the garden's dark.,Barefoot, carefulnon the slick slate slabs,,I need no light, I know the way,,stoop by the mint bed,,scoop a fistful of moist earth,,then grope for a chair,,spread a shawl, and sit,,breathing in the wet green August air. 
 This is the small, still hour,before the newspapernlands in the vestibule like a grenade,,the phone shrills, the computer screennblinks and glares awake. 
 There is this hour:,poem in my head, soil in my hand:,unnamable fullness.,This hour, when blood of my blood,bone of bone, child grownnto manhood now --,stranger, intimate,nnot distant but apart --,lies safe, off dreaming melodies,while love sleeps, safe, in his arms. 
 To have come to this place,,lived to this moment:,immeasurable lightness.,The density of black starts to blur umber.,Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,,then the mourning dove's elegy.,Sable glimmers toward grey;,objects emerge, trailing shadows;,night ages toward day.,The city stirs. 
 There will be other dawns,nnights, gaudy noons.,Likely, I'll lose my way.,There will be stumbling, falling,,cursing the dark.,Whatever comes,,there was this hour when nothing mattered,,all was unbearably dear. 
 And when I'm done with daylights,,should those who loved mengrieve too long a while,,let them remember that I had this hour --,this dark, perfect hour --,and smile. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, I want to talk to you about dreams. 
 I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,,and it's cooler than in the movies.,(Laughter),Beyond flying, breathing fire,,and making hot mennspontaneously appear ...,(Laughter),I can do things like read and write music.,Fun fact is that I wrotenmy personal statement to college,in a dream.,And I did accepted. So, yeah. 
 I am a very visual thinker.,I think in pictures, not words.,To me, words are more likeninstincts and language. 
 There are many people like me;,Nikola Tesla, for example,,who could visualize, design,ntest, and troubleshoot everything --,all of his inventions --nin his mind, accurately. 
 Language is kind of exclusivento our species, anyway.,I am a bit more primitive,,like a beta version of Google Translate.,(Laughter) 
 My brain has the abilitynto hyper-focus on things that interest me.,For example, oncenI had an affair with calculus,that lasted longernthan some celebrity marriages.,(Laughter) 
 There are some othernunusual things about me.,You may have noticednthat I don't have much inflection,in my voice.,That's why peoplenoften confuse me with a GPS.,(Laughter),This can make basic communicationna challenge, unless you need directions.,(Laughter),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 A few years ago, when I startedndoing presentations,,I went to get head shots donenfor the first time.,The photographer told me to look flirty.,(Laughter),And I had no ideanwhat she was talking about.,(Laughter) 
 She said, "Do that thing,nyou know, with your eyes,,when you're flirting with guys." 
 "What thing?" I asked. 
 "You know, squint." 
 And so I tried, really.,It looked something like this.,(Laughter),I looked like I was searching for Waldo.,(Laughter) 
 There's a reason for this,,as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.,(Laughter) 
 I have Asperger's,,a high-functioning form of autism,that impairs the basic social skillsnone is expected to display.,It's made life difficult in many ways,,and growing up,nI struggled to fit in socially.,My friends would tell jokes,nbut I didn't understand them.,My personal heroes were George Carlinnand Stephen Colbert --,and they taught me humor.,My personality switchednfrom being shy and awkward,to being defiant and cursing out a storm.,Needless to say,nI did not have many friends.,I was also hypersensitive to texture.,The feel of water on my skinnwas like pins and needles,,and so for years, I refused to shower.,I can assure you that my hygiene routinenis up to standards now, though.,(Laughter) 
 I had to do a lot to get here,nand my parents --,things kind of got out of controlnwhen I was sexually assaulted by a peer,,and on top of everything,nit made a difficult situation worse.,And I had to travel 2,000 milesnacross the country to get treatment,,but within days of them prescribingna new medication,,my life turned into an episodenof the Walking Dead.,I became paranoid,nand began to hallucinate,that rotting corpsesnwere coming towards me.,My family finally rescued me,,but by that time, I had lost 19 poundsnin those three weeks,,as well as developing severe anemia,,and was on the verge of suicide. 
 I transferred to a new treatment centernthat understood my aversions,,my trauma, and my social anxiety,,and they knew how to treat it,nand I got the help I finally needed.,And after 18 months of hard work,,I went on to do incredible things. 
 One of the things with Asperger'snis that oftentimes,,these people havena very complex inner life,,and I know for myself,nI have a very colorful personality,,rich ideas, and just a lotngoing on in my mind.,But there's a gapnbetween where that stands,,and how I communicate itnwith the rest of the world.,And this can makenbasic communication a challenge. 
 Not many places would hire me,ndue to my lack of social skills,,which is why I applied to Waffle House.,(Laughter),Waffle House is an exceptionaln24-hour diner --,(Laughter),(Applause),thank you --,where you can order your hash browns,the many ways that someonenwould dispose of a human corpse ...,(Laughter),Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked,ntopped, capped, and covered.,(Laughter),As social norms would have it,,you should only go to Waffle Housenat an ungodly hour in the night.,(Laughter),So one time, at 2 am, I was chattingnwith a waitress, and I asked her,,"What's the most ridiculous thingnthat's happened to you on the job?",And she told me that one time,na man walked in completely naked.,(Laughter),I said, "Great! Sign me upnfor the graveyard shift!",(Laughter),Needless to say,nWaffle House did not hire me. 
 So in terms of having Asperger's,nit can be viewed as a disadvantage,,and sometimes it isna real pain in the butt,,but it's also the opposite.,It's a gift, and it allows mento think innovatively.,At 19, I won a research competitionnfor my research on coral reefs,,and I ended up speaking,at the UN Conventionnof Biological Diversity,,presenting this research.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause),And at 22, I'm getting readynto graduate college,,and I am a co-founder of a biotechncompany called AutismSees.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 But consider what I had to do to get here:,25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,nand years of pain and trauma.,I spent a lot of time thinkingnif there's a better way,,and I think there is:nautism-assistive technology.,This technologyncould play an integral role,in helping peoplenwith autistic spectrum disorder,,or ASD. 
 The app Podium, releasednby my company, AutismSees,,has the ability to independently assessnand help develop communication skills.,In addition to this, it tracksneye contact through camera,and simulates a public-speakingnand job-interview experience.,And so maybe one day,nWaffle House will hire me,,after practicing on it some more.,(Laughter),And one of the great thingsnis that I've used Podium,to help me prepare for today,nand it's been a great help.,But it's more than that.,There's more that can be done.,For people with ASD --,it has been speculatednthat many innovative scientists,,researchers, artists,nand engineers have it;,like, for example, Emily Dickinson,nJane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates,are some examples.,But the problem that's encountered,is that these brilliant ideasnoften can't be shared,if there are communication roadblocks.,And so, many people with autismnare being overlooked every day,,and they're being taken advantage of.,So my dream for people with autismnis to change that,,to remove the roadblocksnthat prevent them from succeeding. 
 One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming,is because it allows me to be free,,without judgment of socialnand physical consequences.,When I'm flying over scenesnthat I create in my mind,,I am at peace.,I am free from judgment,,and so I can do whatever I want, you know?,I'm making out with Brad Pitt,nand Angelina is totally cool with it.,(Laughter) 
 But the goal of autism-assistiventechnology is bigger than that,,and more important.,My goal is to shift people's perspective,of autism and peoplenwith higher-functioning Asperger's,because there is a lot they can do.,I mean, look atnTemple Grandin, for example.,And by doing so, we allow peoplento share their talents with this world,and move this world forward.,In addition, we give them the couragento pursue their dreams,in the real world, in real time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestorsnwere insignificant animals.,The most important thing to knownabout prehistoric humans,is that they were unimportant.,Their impact on the world was notnmuch greater than that of jellyfish,or fireflies or woodpeckers.,Today, in contrast,nwe control this planet.,And the question is:,How did we come from there to here?,How did we turn ourselvesnfrom insignificant apes,,minding their own businessnin a corner of Africa,,into the rulers of planet Earth? 
 Usually, we look for the differencenbetween us and all the other animals,on the individual level.,We want to believe -- I want to believe --,that there is something special about me,,about my body, about my brain,,that makes me so superiornto a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.,But the truth is that,non the individual level,,I'm embarrassingly similarnto a chimpanzee.,And if you take me and a chimpanzeenand put us together on some lonely island,,and we had to struggle for survivalnto see who survives better,,I would definitely place my betnon the chimpanzee, not on myself.,And this is not somethingnwrong with me personally.,I guess if they took almost any onenof you, and placed you alone,with a chimpanzee on some island,,the chimpanzee would do much better. 
 The real difference between humansnand all other animals,is not on the individual level;,it's on the collective level.,Humans control the planetnbecause they are the only animals,that can cooperate both flexiblynand in very large numbers.,Now, there are other animals --,like the social insects,nthe bees, the ants --,that can cooperate in large numbers,nbut they don't do so flexibly.,Their cooperation is very rigid.,There is basically just one waynin which a beehive can function.,And if there's a new opportunitynor a new danger,,the bees cannot reinventnthe social system overnight.,They cannot, for example,nexecute the queen,and establish a republic of bees,,or a communist dictatorshipnof worker bees. 
 Other animals, like the social mammals --,the wolves, the elephants,nthe dolphins, the chimpanzees --,they can cooperate much more flexibly,,but they do so only in small numbers,,because cooperation among chimpanzees,is based on intimate knowledge,none of the other.,I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,,and I want to cooperate with you.,I need to know you personally.,What kind of chimpanzee are you?,Are you a nice chimpanzee?,Are you an evil chimpanzee?,Are you trustworthy?,If I don't know you, how can Incooperate with you? 
 The only animal that can combinenthe two abilities together,and cooperate both flexiblynand still do so in very large numbers,is us, Homo sapiens.,One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,,chimpanzees might be better than us.,But, if you pit 1,000 humansnagainst 1,000 chimpanzees,,the humans will win easily,nfor the simple reason,that a thousand chimpanzeesncannot cooperate at all.,And if you now try to cramn100,000 chimpanzees,into Oxford Street,nor into Wembley Stadium,,or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,,you will get chaos, complete chaos.,Just imagine Wembley Stadiumnwith 100,000 chimpanzees.,Complete madness. 
 In contrast, humans normallyngather there in tens of thousands,,and what we get is not chaos, usually.,What we get is extremely sophisticatednand effective networks of cooperation.,All the huge achievementsnof humankind throughout history,,whether it's building the pyramidsnor flying to the moon,,have been based notnon individual abilities,,but on this ability to cooperatenflexibly in large numbers. 
 Think even about this very talknthat I'm giving now:,I'm standing here in front of an audiencenof about 300 or 400 people,,most of you are complete strangers to me.,Similarly, I don't really knownall the people who have organized,and worked on this event.,I don't know the pilotnand the crew members of the plane,that brought me over here,nyesterday, to London.,I don't know the peoplenwho invented and manufactured,this microphone and these cameras,nwhich are recording what I'm saying.,I don't know the peoplenwho wrote all the books and articles,that I read in preparation for this talk.,And I certainly don't know all the people,who might be watching this talknover the Internet,,somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. 
 Nevertheless, even thoughnwe don't know each other,,we can work together to createnthis global exchange of ideas.,This is something chimpanzees cannot do.,They communicate, of course,,but you will never catch a chimpanzeentraveling to some distant chimpanzee band,to give them a talk about bananasnor about elephants,,or anything else that mightninterest chimpanzees.,Now cooperation is, of course,nnot always nice;,all the horrible things humansnhave been doing throughout history --,and we have been doingnsome very horrible things --,all those things are also basednon large-scale cooperation.,Prisons are a system of cooperation;,slaughterhouses are a systemnof cooperation;,concentration campsnare a system of cooperation.,Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhousesnand prisons and concentration camps. 
 Now suppose I've managednto convince you perhaps that yes,,we control the world because we canncooperate flexibly in large numbers.,The next question that immediately arises,in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:,How, exactly, do we do it?,What enables us alone, of all the animals,nto cooperate in such a way?,The answer is our imagination.,We can cooperate flexiblynwith countless numbers of strangers,,because we alone, of allnthe animals on the planet,,can create and believe fictions,nfictional stories.,And as long as everybody believesnin the same fiction,,everybody obeys and followsnthe same rules,,the same norms, the same values. 
 All other animals usentheir communication system,only to describe reality.,A chimpanzee may say, "Look!nThere's a lion, let's run away!",Or, "Look! There's a banana treenover there! Let's go and get bananas!",Humans, in contrast, use their languagennot merely to describe reality,,but also to create new realities,nfictional realities.,A human can say, "Look,nthere is a god above the clouds!,And if you don't do what I tell you to do,,when you die, God will punish younand send you to hell.",And if you all believe this storynthat I've invented,,then you will follow the samennorms and laws and values,,and you can cooperate.,This is something only humans can do.,You can never convince a chimpanzeento give you a banana,by promising him, "... after you die,nyou'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...",(Laughter),"... and you'll receive lots and lotsnof bananas for your good deeds.,So now give me this banana.",No chimpanzee will evernbelieve such a story.,Only humans believe such stories,,which is why we control the world,,whereas the chimpanzees are locked upnin zoos and research laboratories. 
 Now you may find it acceptable that yes,,in the religious field, humans cooperatenby believing in the same fictions.,Millions of people come togethernto build a cathedral or a mosque,or fight in a crusade or a jihad, becausenthey all believe in the same stories,about God and heaven and hell.,But what I want to emphasizenis that exactly the same mechanism,underlies all other formsnof mass-scale human cooperation,,not only in the religious field. 
 Take, for example, the legal field.,Most legal systems today in the worldnare based on a belief in human rights.,But what are human rights?,Human rights, just like God and heaven,nare just a story that we've invented.,They are not an objective reality;,they are not some biological effectnabout homo sapiens.,Take a human being,ncut him open, look inside,,you will find the heart, the kidneys,nneurons, hormones, DNA,,but you won't find any rights.,The only place you find rightsnare in the stories,that we have invented and spread aroundnover the last few centuries.,They may be very positive stories,nvery good stories,,but they're still just fictional storiesnthat we've invented. 
 The same is true of the political field.,The most important factorsnin modern politics are states and nations.,But what are states and nations?,They are not an objective reality.,A mountain is an objective reality.,You can see it, you can touch it,nyou can even smell it.,But a nation or a state,,like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,,this is just a story that we've invented,and became extremely attached to. 
 The same is true of the economic field.,The most important actors todaynin the global economy,are companies and corporations.,Many of you today, perhaps, worknfor a corporation,,like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.,What exactly are these things?,They are what lawyers call legal fictions.,They are stories invented and maintained,by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.,(Laughter),And what do corporations do all day?,Mostly, they try to make money.,Yet, what is money?,Again, money is not an objective reality;nit has no objective value.,Take this green piecenof paper, the dollar bill.,Look at it -- it has no value.,You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,,you cannot wear it.,But then came alongnthese master storytellers --,the big bankers,,the finance ministers,,the prime ministers --,and they tell us a very convincing story:,"Look, you see this green piece of paper?,It is actually worth 10 bananas.",And if I believe it, and you believe it,,and everybody believes it,,it actually works.,I can take this worthless piece of paper,,go to the supermarket,,give it to a complete strangernwhom I've never met before,,and get, in exchange, real bananasnwhich I can actually eat.,This is something amazing.,You could never do it with chimpanzees.,Chimpanzees trade, of course:,"Yes, you give me a coconut,nI'll give you a banana.",That can work.,But, you give mena worthless piece of paper,and you except me to give you a banana?,No way!,What do you think I am, a human?,(Laughter) 
 Money, in fact, isnthe most successful story,ever invented and told by humans,,because it is the only storyneverybody believes.,Not everybody believes in God,,not everybody believes in human rights,,not everybody believes in nationalism,,but everybody believes in money,nand in the dollar bill.,Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.,He hated American politicsnand American religion,and American culture,,but he had no objectionnto American dollars.,He was quite fond of them, actually.,(Laughter) 
 To conclude, then:,We humans control the worldnbecause we live in a dual reality.,All other animals livenin an objective reality.,Their reality consistsnof objective entities,,like rivers and treesnand lions and elephants.,We humans, we also livenin an objective reality.,In our world, too, there are riversnand trees and lions and elephants.,But over the centuries,,we have constructed on topnof this objective reality,a second layer of fictional reality,,a reality made of fictional entities,,like nations, like gods,nlike money, like corporations.,And what is amazing is thatnas history unfolded,,this fictional reality becamenmore and more powerful,so that today, the most powerfulnforces in the world,are these fictional entities.,Today, the very survival of riversnand trees and lions and elephants,depends on the decisions and wishesnof fictional entities,,like the United States, like Google,nlike the World Bank --,entities that exist onlynin our own imagination. 
 Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you havena new book out.,After Sapiens, you wrote another one,,and it's out in Hebrew, but notnyet translated into ... 
 Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working onnthe translation as we speak. 
 BG: In the book, if Inunderstand it correctly,,you argue that the amazing breakthroughsnthat we are experiencing right now,not only will potentiallynmake our lives better,,but they will create -- and I quote you --,"... new classes and new class struggles,njust as the industrial revolution did.",Can you elaborate for us? 
 YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,,we saw the creation of a new classnof the urban proletariat.,And much of the political and socialnhistory of the last 200 years involved,what to do with this class,nand the new problems and opportunities.,Now, we see the creation of a newnmassive class of useless people.,(Laughter),As computers become better and betternin more and more fields,,there is a distinct possibility thatncomputers will out-perform us,in most tasks and will makenhumans redundant.,And then the big politicalnand economic question,of the 21st century will be,,"What do we need humans for?",,or at least, "What do we neednso many humans for?" 
 BG: Do you have an answer in the book? 
 YNH: At present, the best guessnwe have is to keep them happy,with drugs and computer games ...,(Laughter),but this doesn't soundnlike a very appealing future. 
 BG: Ok, so you're basically sayingnin the book and now,,that for all the discussionnabout the growing evidence,of significant economic inequality,nwe are just kind of at the beginning,of the process? 
 YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;,it's seeing all kindsnof possibilities before us.,One possibility is this creationnof a new massive class of useless people.,Another possibility isnthe division of humankind,into different biological castes,,with the rich being upgradedninto virtual gods,,and the poor being degradednto this level of useless people. 
 BG: I feel there is another TED talkncoming up in a year or two.,Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip. 
 YNH: Thanks!,(Applause)Over our lifetimes,,we've all contributed to climate change.,Actions, choices and behaviors,will have led to an increasenin greenhouse gas emissions.,And I think that that'snquite a powerful thought.,But it does have the potentialnto make us feel guilty,when we think about decisionsnwe might have made,around where to travel to,,how often and how,,about the energy that we choose to use,in our homes or in our workplaces,,or quite simply the lifestylesnthat we lead and enjoy.,But we can also turnnthat thought on its head,,and think that if we've hadnsuch a profound,but a negative impactnon our climate already,,then we have an opportunity to influencenthe amount of future climate change,that we will need to adapt to. 
 So we have a choice.,We can either choose to startnto take climate change seriously,,and significantly cut and mitigatenour greenhouse gas emissions,,and then we will have to adapt to lessnof the climate change impacts in future.,Alternatively, we can continue to reallynignore the climate change problem.,But if we do that, we are also choosing,to adapt to very much more powerfulnclimate impacts in future.,And not only that.,As people who live in countriesnwith high per capita emissions,,we're making that choicenon behalf of others as well.,But the choice that we don't have,is a no climate change future. 
 Over the last two decades,,our government negotiatorsnand policymakers have been coming together,to discuss climate change,,and they've been focused onnavoiding a two-degree centigrade warming,above pre-industrial levels.,That's the temperature that's associatednwith dangerous impacts,across a range of different indicators,,to humans and to the environment.,So two degrees centigradenconstitutes dangerous climate change. 
 But dangerous climate changencan be subjective.,So if we think aboutnan extreme weather event,that might happennin some part of the world,,and if that happens in a part of the worldnwhere there is good infrastructure,,where there are peoplenthat are well-insured and so on,,then that impact can be disruptive.,It can cause upset, it could cause cost.,It could even cause some deaths.,But if that exact same weather eventnhappens in a part of the world,where there is poor infrastructure,,or where people are not well-insured,,or they're not havingngood support networks,,then that same climate change impactncould be devastating.,It could cause a significant loss of home,,but it could also causensignificant amounts of death. 
 So this is a graph of the CO2 emissionsnat the left-hand side,from fossil fuel and industry,,and time from beforenthe Industrial Revolution,out towards the present day.,And what's immediately striking about this,is that emissionsnhave been growing exponentially.,If we focus in on a shorternperiod of time from 1950,,we have established in 1988,the Intergovernmental Panelnon Climate Change,,the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,,then rolling on a few years,nin 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,,where it established avoidingna two-degree temperature rise,in keeping with the sciencenand on the basis of equity.,And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.,And all the way through,nduring all of these meetings,and many others as well,,emissions have continued to rise.,And if we focus on our historicalnemission trend in recent years,,and we put that togethernwith our understanding,of the direction of travelnin our global economy,,then we are much more on track,for a four-degree centigradenglobal warming,than we are for the two-degree centigrade. 
 Now, let's just pause for a moment,and think about this four-degreenglobal average temperature.,Most of our planetnis actually made up of the sea.,Now, because the sea has a greaternthermal inertia than the land,,the average temperatures over landnare actually going to be higher,than they are over the sea.,The second thing is that wenas human beings don't experience,global average temperatures.,We experience hot days, cold days,,rainy days, especially if you livenin Manchester like me. 
 So now put yourself in a city center.,Imagine somewhere in the world:,Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London.,It's the hottest daynthat you've ever experienced.,There's sun beating down,,there's concrete and glass all around you.,Now imagine that same day --,but it's six, eight,nmaybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer,on that day during that heat wave.,That's the kind of thingnwe're going to experience,under a four-degree globalnaverage temperature scenario. 
 And the problem with these extremes,,and not just the temperature extremes,,but also the extremes in terms of stormsnand other climate impacts,,is our infrastructure is just not set upnto deal with these sorts of events.,So our roads and our rail networks,have been designed to last for a long time,and withstand onlyncertain amounts of impacts,in different parts of the world.,And this is going to benextremely challenged.,Our power stationsnare expected to be cooled by water,to a certain temperaturento remain effective and resilient.,And our buildingsnare designed to be comfortable,within a particular temperature range.,And this is all going to bensignificantly challenged,under a four-degree-type scenario.,Our infrastructure has not beenndesigned to cope with this. 
 So if we go back, also thinkingnabout four degrees,,it's not just the direct impacts,,but also some indirect impacts.,So if we take food security, for example.,Maize and wheat yields,in some parts of the world,are expected to be up to 40 percent lower,under a four-degree scenario,,rice up to 30 percent lower.,This will be absolutely devastatingnfor global food security.,So all in all, the kindsnof impacts anticipated,under this four-degree centigrade scenario,are going to be incompatiblenwith global organized living. 
 So back to our trajectories and our graphsnof four degrees and two degrees.,Is it reasonable stillnto focus on the two-degree path?,There are quite a lot of my colleaguesnand other scientists,who would say that it's now too latento avoid a two-degree warming.,But I would just likento draw on my own research,on energy systems, on food systems,,aviation and also shipping,,just to say that I think there is stillna small fighting chance,of avoiding this two-degreendangerous climate change.,But we really neednto get to grips with the numbers,to work out how to do it. 
 So if you focus in on this trajectorynand these graphs,,the yellow circle therenhighlights that the departure,from the red four-degree pathway,to the two-degreengreen pathway is immediate.,And that's becausenof cumulative emissions,,or the carbon budget.,So in other words, becausenof the lights and the projectors,that are on in this room right now,,the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere,as a result of thatnelectricity consumption,lasts a very long time.,Some of it will be in our atmospherenfor a century, maybe much longer.,It will accumulate, and greenhouse gasesntend to be cumulative.,And that tells us somethingnabout these trajectories.,First of all, it tells us that it'snthe area under these curves that matter,,not where we reachnat a particular date in future.,And that's important,nbecause it doesn't matter,if we come up with some amazingnwhiz-bang technology,to sort out our energy problemnon the last day of 2049,,just in the nick of timento sort things out.,Because in the meantime,nemissions will have accumulated.,So if we continue on this red,nfour-degree centigrade scenario pathway,,the longer we continue on it,,that will need to benmade up for in later years,to keep the same carbon budget,nto keep the same area under the curve,,which means that that trajectory,nthe red one there, becomes steeper.,So in other words, if we don't reducenemissions in the short to medium term,,then we'll have to make more significantnyear-on-year emission reductions.,We also know that we havento decarbonize our energy system.,But if we don't start to cutnemissions in the short to medium term,,then we will have to do that even sooner.,So this poses really bignchallenges for us. 
 The other thing it does is tells usnsomething about energy policy.,If you live in a part of the world wherenper capita emissions are already high,,it points us towardsnreducing energy demand.,And that's becausenwith all the will in the world,,the large-scale engineering infrastructure,that we need to roll out rapidly,to decarbonize the supply sidenof our energy system,is just simply not goingnto happen in time.,So it doesn't matternwhether we choose nuclear power,or carbon capture and storage,,upscale our biofuel production,,or go for a much bigger roll-outnof wind turbines and wave turbines.,All of that will take time.,So because it's the areanunder the curve that matters,,we need to focus on energy efficiency,,but also on energy conservation --nin other words, using less energy.,And if we do that, that also means,that as we continue to roll outnthe supply-side technology,,we will have less of a job to donif we've actually managed,to reduce our energy consumption,,because we will then neednless infrastructure on the supply side. 
 Another issue that we reallynneed to grapple with,is the issue of well-being and equity.,There are many parts of the world wherenthe standard of living needs to rise.,Bbut with energy systemsncurrently reliant on fossil fuel,,as those economies grownso will emissions.,And now, if we're all constrainednby the same amount of carbon budget,,that means that if some parts ofnthe world's emissions are needing to rise,,then other parts of the world'snemissions need to reduce. 
 So that poses very significant challengesnfor wealthy nations.,Because according to our research,,if you're in a country where per capitanemissions are really high --,so North America, Europe, Australia --,emissions reductions of the ordernof 10 percent per year,,and starting immediately,nwill be required for a good chance,of avoiding the two-degree target.,Let me just put that into context.,The economist Nicholas Stern,said that emission reductionsnof more than one percent per year,had only ever been associatednwith economic recession or upheaval.,So this poses huge challengesnfor the issue of economic growth,,because if we have ournhigh carbon infrastructure in place,,it means that if our economies grow,,then so do our emissions.,So I'd just like to takena quote from a paper,by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011,where we said that to avoid the two-degreenframing of dangerous climate change,,economic growth needs to be exchangednat least temporarily,for a period of planned austeritynin wealthy nations. 
 This is a really difficultnmessage to take,,because what it suggests is thatnwe really need to do things differently.,This is not about just incremental change.,This is about doing things differently,nabout whole system change,,and sometimesnit's about doing less things.,And this applies to all of us,,whatever sphere of influence we have.,So it could be from writingnto our local politician,to talking to our boss at worknor being the boss at work,,or talking with our friends and family,nor, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.,Because we really neednto make significant change.,At the moment, we're choosingna four-degree scenario.,If we really want to avoidnthe two-degree scenario,,there really is no timenlike the present to act. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Alice,nbasically what you're saying,,the talk is, unless wealthy nationsnstart cutting 10 percent per year,the emissions now, this year,nnot in 2020 or '25,,we are going to go straightnto the four-plus-degree scenario.,I am wondering what's your takenon the cut by 70 percent for 2070. 
 Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's justnnowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.,One of the things that often --,when there are these modeling studiesnthat look at what we need to do,,is they tend to hugely overestimatenhow quickly other countries in the world,can start to reduce emissions.,So they make kind ofnheroic assumptions about that.,The more we do that,nbecause it's the cumulative emissions,,the short-term stuff that really matters.,So it does make a huge difference.,If a big country like China, for example,,continues to growneven for just a few extra years,,that will make a big differencento when we need to decarbonize.,So I don't think we can even saynwhen it will be,,because it all dependsnon what we have to do in the short term.,But I think we've just got huge scope,nand we don't pull those levers,that allow us to reducenthe energy demand, which is a shame. 
 BG: Alice, thank you for comingnto TED and sharing this data. 
 ABL: Thank you. 
 (Applause)For the last year,,everyone's been watching the same show,,and I'm not talkingnabout "Game of Thrones,",but a horrifying, real-life drama,that's proved too fascinating to turn off.,It's a show produced by murderers,and shared around the worldnvia the Internet.,Their names have become familiar:,James Foley, Steven Sotloff,nDavid Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,,Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo. 
 Their beheadings by the Islamic State,were barbaric,,but if we think they were archaic,,from a remote, obscure age,,then we're wrong.,They were uniquely modern,,because the murderers acted knowing well,that millions of peoplenwould tune in to watch. 
 The headlines called themnsavages and barbarians,,because the image of one mannoverpowering another,,killing him with a knife to the throat,,conforms to our ideanof ancient, primitive practices,,the polar oppositenof our urban, civilized ways.,We don't do things like that.,But that's the irony.,We think a beheadingnhas nothing to do with us,,even as we click on the screen to watch.,But it is to do with us.,The Islamic State beheadings,are not ancient or remote.,They're a global, 21st century event,,a 21st century event that takes placenin our living rooms, at our desks,,on our computer screens.,They're entirely dependentnon the power of technology to connect us.,And whether we like it or not,,everyone who watchesnis a part of the show. 
 And lots of people watch.,We don't know exactly how many.,Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.,But a poll taken in the UK,nfor example, in August 2014,,estimated that 1.2 million people,had watched the beheading of James Foley,in the few days after it was released.,And that's just the first few days,,and just Britain.,A similar poll taken in the United States,in November 2014,found that nine percent of those surveyed,had watched beheading videos,,and a further 23 percent,had watched the videos but had stoppednjust before the death was shown.,Nine percent may be a small minoritynof all the people who could watch,,but it's still a very large crowd.,And of course that crowdnis growing all the time,,because every week, every month,,more people will keep downloadingnand keep watching. 
 If we go back 11 years,,before sites like YouTubenand Facebook were born,,it was a similar story.,When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,,Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,,those videos were shownnduring the Iraq War. 
 Nick Berg's beheading,quickly became one of the mostnsearched for items on the Internet.,Within a day, it was the top search term,across search enginesnlike Google, Lycos, Yahoo.,In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,,these were the top 10 search termsnin the United States.,The Berg beheading video remainednthe most popular search term for a week,,and it was the second most popularnsearch term for the whole month of May,,runner-up only to "American Idol.",The al-Qaeda-linked websitenthat first showed Nick Berg's beheading,had to close down within a couple of daysndue to overwhelming traffic to the site.,One Dutch website owner saidnthat his daily viewing figures,rose from 300,000 to 750,000,every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.,He told reporters 18 months later,that it had been downloadednmany millions of times,,and that's just one website.,A similar pattern was seen again and again,when videos of beheadingsnwere released during the Iraq War. 
 Social media sites have made these imagesnmore accessible than ever before,,but if we takenanother step back in history,,we'll see that it was the cameranthat first created a new kind of crowd,in our history of beheadingsnas public spectacle.,As soon as the cameranappeared on the scene,,a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,,it had an immediatenand unequivocal effect. 
 That day, the first film of a publicnbeheading was created in France.,It was the execution, the guillotining,nof a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,,outside the prisonnSaint-Pierre in Versailles.,Weidmann was due to be executednat the crack of dawn,,as was customary at the time,,but his executioner was new to the job,,and he'd underestimatednhow long it would take him to prepare.,So Weidmann was executednat 4:30 in the morning,,by which time on a June morning,,there was enough lightnto take photographs,,and a spectator in the crowdnfilmed the event,,unbeknownst to the authorities.,Several still photographsnwere taken as well,,and you can still watchnthe film online today,and look at the photographs.,The crowd on the daynof Weidmann's execution,was called "unruly"nand "disgusting" by the press,,but that was nothing comparednto the untold thousands of people,who could now study the action,over and over again,,freeze-framed in every detail. 
 The camera may have made these scenesnmore accessible than ever before,,but it's not just about the camera.,If we take a bigger leap back in history,,we'll see that for as longnas there have been,public judicial executions and beheadings,,there have been the crowds to see them.,In London, as late asnthe early 19th century,,there might be four or five thousandnpeople to see a standard hanging.,There could be 40,000 or 50,000nto see a famous criminal killed.,And a beheading, which wasna rare event in England at the time,,attracted even more. 
 In May 1820,,five men known asnthe Cato Street Conspirators,were executed in London for plotting,to assassinate membersnof the British government.,They were hung and then decapitated.,It was a gruesome scene.,Each man's head was hacked off in turnnand held up to the crowd.,And 100,000 people,,that's 10,000 more than can fitninto Wembley Stadium,,had turned out to watch.,The streets were packed.,People had rented outnwindows and rooftops.,People had climbed onto cartsnand wagons in the street.,People climbed lamp posts.,People had been known to have diednin the crush on popular execution days. 
 Evidence suggestsnthat throughout our history,of public beheadingsnand public executions,,the vast majority of the peoplenwho come to see,are either enthusiasticnor, at best, unmoved.,Disgust has been comparatively rare,,and even when peoplenare disgusted and are horrified,,it doesn't always stop themnfrom coming out all the same to watch. 
 Perhaps the most striking example,of the human ability to watchna beheading and remain unmoved,and even be disappointed,was the introduction in Francenin 1792 of the guillotine,,that famous decapitation machine.,To us in the 21st century,,the guillotine may seemnlike a monstrous contraption,,but to the first crowds who saw it,nit was actually a disappointment.,They were used to seeing long, drawn-out,ntorturous executions on the scaffold,,where people were mutilatednand burned and pulled apart slowly.,To them, watchingnthe guillotine in action,,it was so quick, there was nothing to see.,The blade fell, the head fellninto a basket, out of sight immediately,,and they called out,,"Give me back my gallows,ngive me back my wooden gallows." 
 The end of torturous publicnjudicial executions in Europe and America,was partly to do with beingnmore humane towards the criminal,,but it was also partly because the crowdnobstinately refused to behave,in the way that they should.,All too often, execution day,was more like a carnivalnthan a solemn ceremony. 
 Today, a public judicial executionnin Europe or America is unthinkable,,but there are other scenariosnthat should make us cautious,about thinkingnthat things are different now,and we don't behave like that anymore. 
 Take, for example,nthe incidents of suicide baiting.,This is when a crowd gathers,to watch a person who has climbednto the top of a public building,in order to kill themselves,,and people in the crowd shout and jeer,,"Get on with it! Go on and jump!",This is a well-recognized phenomenon.,One paper in 1981 found that in 10nout of 21 threatened suicide attempts,,there was incidents of suicide baitingnand jeering from a crowd.,And there have been incidentsnreported in the press this year.,This was a very widely reported incident,in Telford and Shropshirenin March this year. 
 And when it happens today,,people take photographsnand they take videos on their phones,and they post those videos online.,When it comes to brutal murderersnwho post their beheading videos,,the Internet has createdna new kind of crowd.,Today, the action takes placenin a distant time and place,,which gives the viewer a sensenof detachment from what's happening,,a sense of separation.,It's nothing to do with me.,It's already happened.,We are also offerednan unprecedented sense of intimacy.,Today, we are all offered front row seats.,We can all watch in private,nin our own time and space,,and no one need ever knownthat we've clicked on the screen to watch. 
 This sense of separation --,from other people,nfrom the event itself --,seems to be key to understandingnour ability to watch,,and there are several ways,in which the Internetncreates a sense of detachment,that seems to erodenindividual moral responsibility.,Our activities onlinenare often contrasted with real life,,as though the things we do onlinenare somehow less real.,We feel less accountable for our actions,when we interact online.,There's a sense of anonymity,na sense of invisibility,,so we feel less accountablenfor our behavior.,The Internet also makes it far easiernto stumble upon things inadvertently,,things that we would usually avoidnin everyday life.,Today, a video can start playingnbefore you even know what you're watching.,Or you may be tempted to look at materialnthat you wouldn't look at in everyday life,or you wouldn't look at if younwere with other people at the time.,And when the action is pre-recorded,and takes placenin a distant time and space,,watching seems like a passive activity.,There's nothing I can do about it now.,It's already happened. 
 All these things make it easiernas an Internet user,for us to give in to our sensenof curiosity about death,,to push our personal boundaries,,to test our sense of shock,nto explore our sense of shock. 
 But we're not passive when we watch.,On the contrary, we're fulfillingnthe murderer's desire to be seen.,When the victim of a decapitationnis bound and defenseless,,he or she essentially becomesna pawn in their killer's show.,Unlike a trophy headnthat's taken in battle,,that represents the luck and skillnit takes to win a fight,,when a beheading is staged,,when it's essentially a piece of theater,,the power comes from the receptionnthe killer receives as he performs.,In other words, watchingnis very much part of the event.,The event no longer takes placenin a single location,at a certain point in time as it used tonand as it may still appear to.,Now the event is stretched outnin time and place,,and everyone who watches plays their part. 
 We should stop watching,,but we know we won't.,History tells us we won't,,and the killers know it too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you.nLet me get this back. Thank you.,Let's move here. While they installnfor the next performance,,I want to ask you the questionnthat probably many here have,,which is how did younget interested in this topic? 
 Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum,called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,,which was famous for its displaynof shrunken heads from South America.,People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken headnmuseum, the shrunken head museum!",And at the time,nI was working on the history,of scientific collections of skulls.,I was working on the cranial collections,,and it just struck me as ironic,that here were people coming to seenthis gory, primitive, savage culture,that they were almostnfantasizing about and creating,without really understandingnwhat they were seeing,,and all the while these vast --nI mean hundreds of thousands,of skulls in our museums,nall across Europe and the States --,were kind of upholding this Enlightenmentnpursuit of scientific rationality.,So I wanted to kind of twist it roundnand say, "Let's look at us.",We're looking through the glass casenat these shrunken heads.,Let's look at our own history and our ownncultural fascination with these things.,BG: Thank you for sharing that. 
 FL: Thank you. 
 (Applause)If you want to buy high-quality,nlow-price cocaine,,there really is only one place to go,,and that is the dark netnanonymous markets. 
 Now, you can't get to these sites,with a normal browser --nChrome or Firefox --,because they're on thisnhidden part of the Internet,,known as Tor hidden services,,where URLs are a string of meaninglessnnumbers and letters that end in .onion,,and which you accessnwith a special browser,called the Tor browser. 
 Now, the Tor browser was originallyna U.S. Naval intelligence project.,It then became open source,,and it allows anybody to browse the net,without giving away their location.,And it does thisnby encrypting your IP address,and then routing it via severalnother computers around the world,that use the same software.,You can use it on the normal Internet,,but it's also your key to the dark net.,And because of this fiendishlynclever encryption system,,the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --nthousand sites that operate there,are incredibly difficult to shut down.,It is a censorship-free worldnvisited by anonymous users. 
 Little wonder, then,nthat it's a natural place to go,for anybody with something to hide,,and that something, of course,nneed not be illegal.,On the dark net, you will find,whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.,You will find political activism blogs.,You will find libraries of pirated books.,But you'll also find the drugs markets,,illegal pornography,ncommercial hacking services,,and much more besides.,Now, the dark net is one of the mostninteresting, exciting places,anywhere on the net.,And the reason is, becausenalthough innovation, of course,,takes place in big businesses,,takes place in world-class universities,,it also takes place in the fringes,,because those on the fringes --nthe pariahs, the outcasts --,they're often the most creative,nbecause they have to be.,In this part of the Internet,,you will not find a single lolcat,,a single pop-up advert anywhere.,And that's one of the reasons why I think,many of you here will benon the dark net fairly soon. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not that I'm suggestingnanyone in this audience would use it,to go and procure high-quality narcotics.,But let's say for a moment that you were. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bear with me.,The first thing you will noticenon signing up to one of these sites,is how familiar it looks.,Every single product --,thousands of products --,has a glossy, high-res image,,a detailed product description, a price.,There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.,There is even, most beautifully of all,,a "Report this item" button. 
 (Laughter) 
 Incredible. 
 You browse through the site,nyou make your choice,,you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,,you enter an address -- npreferably not your home address --,and you wait for your productnto arrive in the post,,which it nearly always does.,And the reason it doesnis not because of the clever encryption.,That's important.,Something far simpler than that.,It's the user reviews. 
 (Laughter) 
 You see, every single vendornon these sites,uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,,but they keep the same pseudonymnto build up a reputation.,And because it's easy for the buyernto change allegiance whenever they want,,the only way of trusting a vendor,is if they have a good historynof positive feedback,from other users of the site. 
 And this introductionnof competition and choice,does exactly whatnthe economists would predict.,Prices tend to go down,nproduct quality tends to go up,,and the vendors are attentive,,they're polite, they're consumer-centric,,offering you all mannernof special deals, one-offs,,buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,,to keep you happy. 
 I spoke to Drugsheaven.,Drugsheaven was offeringnexcellent and consistent marijuana,at a reasonable price.,He had a very generous refund policy,,detailed T's and C's,,and good shipping times. 
 "Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,,via the internal emailing systemnthat's also encrypted, of course.,"I'm new here. Do you mindnif I buy just one gram of marijuana?" 
 A couple of hours later, I get a reply.,They always reply. 
 "Hi there, thanks for your email.,Starting small is a wise thing to do.nI would, too, if I were you." 
 (Laughter) 
 "So no problem if you'd like to startnwith just one gram.,I do hope we can do business together.,Best wishes, Drugsheaven." 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know why he had a poshnEnglish accent, but I assume he did. 
 Now, this kindnof consumer-centric attitude,is the reason why, when I reviewedn120,000 pieces of feedback,that had been left on one of these sitesnover a three-month period,,95 percent of them were five out of five.,The customer, you see, is king.,But what does that mean?,Well, on the one hand,,that means there are more drugs,nmore available, more easily,,to more people.,And by my reckoning,nthat is not a good thing.,But, on the other hand,nif you are going to take drugs,,you have a reasonably good way,of guaranteeing a certain levelnof purity and quality,,which is incredibly importantnif you're taking drugs.,And you can do sonfrom the comfort of your own home,,without the risks associatednwith buying on the streets. 
 Now, as I said,,you've got to be creative and innovativento survive in this marketplace.,And the 20 or so sitesnthat are currently in operation --,by the way, they don't always work,nthey're not always perfect;,the site that I showed younwas shut down 18 months ago,,but not before it had turnednover a billion dollars' worth of trade.,But these markets,,because of the difficult conditionsnin which they are operating,,the inhospitable conditions,,are always innovating, alwaysnthinking of ways of getting smarter,,more decentralized, harder to censor,,and more customer-friendly. 
 Let's take the payment system.,You don't pay with your credit card,,of course -- that would leadndirectly back to you.,So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,,which is easily exchangednfor real-world currencies,and gives quite a high degreenof anonymity to its users. 
 But at the beginning of these sites,npeople noticed a flaw.,Some of the unscrupulous dealersnwere running away with peoples' bitcoin,before they'd mailed the drugs out.,The community came up with a solution,ncalled multi-signature escrow payments.,So on purchasing my item,,I would send my bitcoin,to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.,The vendor, who would seenthat I'd sent it,,would be confident that theyncould then send the product to me,,and then when I received it,,at least two of the three peoplenengaged in the transaction --,vendor, buyer, site administrator --,would have to sign the transaction off,with a unique digital signature,,and then the money would be transferred. 
 Brilliant!,Elegant.,It works. 
 But then they realized there wasna problem with bitcoin,,because every bitcoin transaction,is actually recorded publiclynin a public ledger.,So if you're clever, you can trynand work out who's behind them.,So they came up with a tumbling service.,Hundreds of people sendntheir bitcoin into one address,,they're tumbled and jumbled up,,and then the right amountnis sent on to the right recipients,,but they're different bitcoins:,micro-laundering systems. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's incredible. 
 Interested in what drugs are trendingnright now on the dark net markets?,Check Grams, the search engine.,You can even buy some advertising space. 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you an ethical consumer worriednabout what the drugs industry is doing?,Yeah.,One vendor will offer younfair trade organic cocaine. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not being sourcednfrom Colombian druglords,,but Guatemalan farmers.,They even promised to reinvestn20 percent of any profits,into local education programs. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's even a mystery shopper. 
 Now, whatever you thinknabout the morality of these sites --,and I submit that it's notnactually an easy question --,the creation of functioning,ncompetitive, anonymous markets,,where nobody knows who anybody else is,,constantly at risk of being shut downnby the authorities,,is a staggering achievement,,a phenomenal achievement.,And it's that kind of innovation,that's why those on the fringes,are often the harbingersnof what is to come. 
 It's easy to forget,that because of its short life,,the Internet has actuallynchanged many times,over the last 30 years or so.,It started in the '70snas a military project,,morphed in the 1980snto an academic network,,co-opted by commercialncompanies in the '90s,,and then invaded by all of usnvia social media in the noughties,,but I think it's going to change again.,And I think thingsnlike the dark net markets --,creative, secure, difficult to censor --,I think that's the future. 
 And the reason it's the future,is because we're all worriednabout our privacy.,Surveys consistently shownconcerns about privacy.,The more time we spend online,nthe more we worry about them,,and those surveys shownour worries are growing.,We're worried aboutnwhat happens to our data.,We're worried aboutnwho might be watching us. 
 Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,,there's been a huge increasenin the number of people,using various privacy-enhancing tools.,There are now between twonand three million daily users,of the Tor browser,,the majority of which usenis perfectly legitimate,,sometimes even mundane.,And there are hundreds of activistsnaround the world,working on techniques and toolsnto keep you private online --,default encrypted messaging services.,Ethereum, which is a projectnwhich tries to link up,the connected but unused hard drivesnof millions of computers around the world,,to create a sort of distributed Internetnthat no one really controls.,Now, we've had distributedncomputing before, of course.,We use it for everything from Skypento the search for extraterrestrial life.,But you add distributed computingnand powerful encryption --,that's very, very hardnto censor and control.,Another called MaidSafenworks on similar principles.,Another called Twister,nand so on and so on. 
 And here's the thing --,the more of us join,,the more interesting those sites become,,and then the more of us join, and so on.,And I think that's what's going to happen. 
 In fact, it's already happening.,The dark net is no longerna den for dealers,and a hideout for whistle-blowers.,It's already going mainstream.,Just recently, the musician Aphex Twinnreleased his album as a dark net site.,Facebook has started a dark net site.,A group of London architectsnhave opened a dark net site,for people worriednabout regeneration projects.,Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,,and I predict that fairly soon,nevery social media company,,every major news outlet,,and therefore most of younin this audience,,will be using the dark net, too. 
 So the Internet is about to getnmore interesting,,more exciting, more innovative,,more terrible,,more destructive.,That's good newsnif you care about liberty.,It's good news if you care about freedom.,It's good news if you carenabout democracy.,It's also good news,if you want to browsenfor illegal pornography,and if you want to buy and sell drugs,with impunity.,Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.,It's not one side or the othernthat's going to win out, but both. 
 Thank you very much, indeed. 
 (Applause)I'd like to introduce younto an emerging area of science,,one that is still speculativenbut hugely exciting,,and certainly onenthat's growing very rapidly.,Quantum biologynasks a very simple question:,Does quantum mechanics --,that weird and wonderfulnand powerful theory,of the subatomic worldnof atoms and molecules,that underpins so muchnof modern physics and chemistry --,also play a role inside the living cell?,In other words: Are there processes,nmechanisms, phenomena,in living organismsnthat can only be explained,with a helping handnfrom quantum mechanics?,Now, quantum biology isn't new;,it's been around since the early 1930s.,But it's only in the last decade or sonthat careful experiments --,in biochemistry labs,nusing spectroscopy --,have shown very clear, firm evidencenthat there are certain specific mechanisms,that require quantum mechanicsnto explain them. 
 Quantum biology brings togethernquantum physicists, biochemists,,molecular biologists --nit's a very interdisciplinary field.,I come from quantum physics,nso I'm a nuclear physicist. 
 I've spent more than three decades,trying to get my headnaround quantum mechanics.,One of the foundersnof quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,,said, If you're not astonished by it,nthen you haven't understood it.,So I sort of feel happynthat I'm still astonished by it.,That's a good thing.,But it means I study the verynsmallest structures in the universe --,the building blocks of reality.,If we think about the scale of size,,start with an everyday objectnlike the tennis ball,,and just go down ordersnof magnitude in size --,from the eye of a needle down to a cell,ndown to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --,you eventually reach the nano-world. 
 Now, nanotechnology may bena term you've heard of.,A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.,My area is the atomic nucleus,nwhich is the tiny dot inside an atom.,It's even smaller in scale.,This is the domain of quantum mechanics,,and physicists and chemistsnhave had a long time,to try and get used to it.,Biologists, on the other hand,nhave got off lightly, in my view.,They are very happy with theirnballs-and-sticks models of molecules. 
 (Laughter) 
 The balls are the atoms, the sticksnare the bonds between the atoms.,And when they can't build themnphysically in the lab,,nowadays, they havenvery powerful computers,that will simulate a huge molecule.,This is a protein made upnof 100,000 atoms.,It doesn't really require much in the waynof quantum mechanics to explain it.,Quantum mechanicsnwas developed in the 1920s.,It is a set of beautiful and powerfulnmathematical rules and ideas,that explain the world of the very small.,And it's a world that's very differentnfrom our everyday world,,made up of trillions of atoms.,It's a world builtnon probability and chance.,It's a fuzzy world.,It's a world of phantoms,,where particles can also behavenlike spread-out waves. 
 If we imagine quantum mechanicsnor quantum physics, then,,as the fundamentalnfoundation of reality itself,,then it's not surprising that we say,quantum physics underpinsnorganic chemistry.,After all, it gives usnthe rules that tell us,how the atoms fit togethernto make organic molecules.,Organic chemistry,nscaled up in complexity,,gives us molecular biology,nwhich of course leads to life itself.,So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.,It's almost trivial.,You say, "Well, of course life ultimatelynmust depend of quantum mechanics.",But so does everything else.,So does all inanimate matter,nmade up of trillions of atoms. 
 Ultimately, there's a quantum level,where we have to delve intonthis weirdness.,But in everyday life,nwe can forget about it.,Because once you put togetherntrillions of atoms,,that quantum weirdnessnjust dissolves away.,Quantum biology isn't about this.,Quantum biology isn't this obvious.,Of course quantum mechanicsnunderpins life at some molecular level.,Quantum biology is about lookingnfor the non-trivial --,the counterintuitive ideasnin quantum mechanics --,and to see if they do, indeed,nplay an important role,in describing the processes of life. 
 Here is my perfect examplenof the counterintuitiveness,of the quantum world.,This is the quantum skier.,He seems to be intact,nhe seems to be perfectly healthy,,and yet, he seems to have gone aroundnboth sides of that tree at the same time.,Well, if you saw tracks like that,you'd guess it was somensort of stunt, of course.,But in the quantum world,nthis happens all the time.,Particles can multitask,nthey can be in two places at once.,They can do more than one thingnat the same time.,Particles can behavenlike spread-out waves.,It's almost like magic. 
 Physicists and chemists have hadnnearly a century,of trying to get used to this weirdness.,I don't blame the biologists,for not having to or wantingnto learn quantum mechanics. 
 You see, this weirdness is very delicate;,and we physicists work very hardnto maintain it in our labs.,We cool our system downnto near absolute zero,,we carry out our experiments in vacuums,,we try and isolate itnfrom any external disturbance.,That's very different from the warm,nmessy, noisy environment of a living cell.,Biology itself, if you think ofnmolecular biology,,seems to have done very wellnin describing all the processes of life,in terms of chemistry --nchemical reactions.,And these are reductionist,ndeterministic chemical reactions,,showing that, essentially, life is madenof the same stuff as everything else,,and if we can forget about quantumnmechanics in the macro world,,then we should be able to forgetnabout it in biology, as well. 
 Well, one man beggednto differ with this idea.,Erwin Schrödinger,nof Schrödinger's Cat fame,,was an Austrian physicist.,He was one of the foundersnof quantum mechanics in the 1920s.,In 1944, he wrote a bookncalled "What is Life?",It was tremendously influential.,It influenced Francis Cricknand James Watson,,the discoverers of the double-helixnstructure of DNA.,To paraphrase a descriptionnin the book, he says:,At the molecular level,nliving organisms have a certain order,,a structure to them that's very different,from the random thermodynamic jostlingnof atoms and molecules,in inanimate matternof the same complexity. 
 In fact, living matter seems to behavenin this order, in a structure,,just like inanimate matterncooled down to near absolute zero,,where quantum effectsnplay a very important role.,There's something specialnabout the structure -- the order --,inside a living cell.,So, Schrödinger speculated that maybenquantum mechanics plays a role in life.,It's a very speculative,nfar-reaching idea,,and it didn't really go very far. 
 But as I mentioned at the start,,in the last 10 years, there have beennexperiments emerging,,showing where some of thesencertain phenomena in biology,do seem to require quantum mechanics. 
 I want to share with younjust a few of the exciting ones.,This is one of the best-knownnphenomena in the quantum world,,quantum tunneling.,The box on the left showsnthe wavelike, spread-out distribution,of a quantum entity --na particle, like an electron,,which is not a little ballnbouncing off a wall.,It's a wave that has a certain probabilitynof being able to permeate,through a solid wall, like a phantomnleaping through to the other side.,You can see a faint smudge of lightnin the right-hand box.,Quantum tunneling suggests that a particlencan hit an impenetrable barrier,,and yet somehow, as though by magic,,disappear from one sidenand reappear on the other.,The nicest way of explaining it isnif you want to throw a ball over a wall,,you have to give it enough energynto get over the top of the wall.,In the quantum world,nyou don't have to throw it over the wall,,you can throw it at the wall,nand there's a certain non-zero probability,that it'll disappear on your side,nand reappear on the other. 
 This isn't speculation, by the way.,We're happy -- well, "happy"nis not the right word -- 
 (Laughter) 
 we are familiar with this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Quantum tunnelingntakes place all the time;,in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.,The particles fuse together,,and the Sun turns hydrogenninto helium through quantum tunneling.,Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discoverednthat quantum tunneling also takes place,inside living cells.,Enzymes, those workhorses of life,nthe catalysts of chemical reactions --,enzymes are biomolecules that speed upnchemical reactions in living cells,,by many, many orders of magnitude.,And it's always been a mysterynhow they do this. 
 Well, it was discovered,that one of the tricks that enzymesnhave evolved to make use of,,is by transferring subatomic particles,nlike electrons and indeed protons,,from one part of a moleculento another via quantum tunneling.,It's efficient, it's fast,nit can disappear --,a proton can disappear from one place,nand reappear on the other.,Enzymes help this take place. 
 This is research that's beenncarried out back in the 80s,,particularly by a groupnin Berkeley, Judith Klinman.,Other groups in the UKnhave now also confirmed,that enzymes really do this. 
 Research carried out by my group --,so as I mentioned,nI'm a nuclear physicist,,but I've realized I've got these toolsnof using quantum mechanics,in atomic nuclei, and so can applynthose tools in other areas as well.,One question we asked,is whether quantum tunnelingnplays a role in mutations in DNA.,Again, this is not a new idea;nit goes all the way back to the early 60s.,The two strands of DNA,nthe double-helix structure,,are held together by rungs;nit's like a twisted ladder.,And those rungs of the laddernare hydrogen bonds --,protons, that act as the gluenbetween the two strands.,So if you zoom in, what they're doingnis holding these large molecules --,nucleotides -- together.,Zoom in a bit more.,So, this a computer simulation.,The two white ballsnin the middle are protons,,and you can see thatnit's a double hydrogen bond.,One prefers to sit on one side;nthe other, on the other side,of the two strands of the vertical linesngoing down, which you can't see.,It can happen thatnthese two protons can hop over.,Watch the two white balls.,They can jump over to the other side.,If the two strands of DNA then separate,nleading to the process of replication,,and the two protonsnare in the wrong positions,,this can lead to a mutation. 
 This has been known for half a century.,The question is: How likelynare they to do that,,and if they do, how do they do it?,Do they jump across,nlike the ball going over the wall?,Or can they quantum-tunnel across,neven if they don't have enough energy?,Early indications suggest thatnquantum tunneling can play a role here.,We still don't know yetnhow important it is;,this is still an open question.,It's speculative,,but it's one of those questionsnthat is so important,that if quantum mechanicsnplays a role in mutations,,surely this must have big implications,,to understand certain types of mutations,,possibly even those that leadnto turning a cell cancerous. 
 Another example of quantum mechanicsnin biology is quantum coherence,,in one of the mostnimportant processes in biology,,photosynthesis: plantsnand bacteria taking sunlight,,and using that energy to create biomass.,Quantum coherence is the ideanof quantum entities multitasking.,It's the quantum skier.,It's an object that behaves like a wave,,so that it doesn't just movenin one direction or the other,,but can follow multiple pathwaysnat the same time. 
 Some years ago,nthe world of science was shocked,when a paper was publishednshowing experimental evidence,that quantum coherencentakes place inside bacteria,,carrying out photosynthesis.,The idea is that the photon,nthe particle of light, the sunlight,,the quantum of lightncaptured by a chlorophyll molecule,,is then delivered to what's callednthe reaction center,,where it can be turned intonchemical energy.,And in getting there,nit doesn't just follow one route;,it follows multiple pathways at once,,to optimize the most efficient waynof reaching the reaction center,without dissipating as waste heat.,Quantum coherence taking placeninside a living cell.,A remarkable idea,,and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,nwith new papers coming out,,confirming that thisndoes indeed take place. 
 My third and final examplenis the most beautiful, wonderful idea.,It's also still very speculative,nbut I have to share it with you.,The European robinnmigrates from Scandinavia,down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,,and like a lot of othernmarine animals and even insects,,they navigate by sensingnthe Earth's magnetic field.,Now, the Earth's magnetic fieldnis very, very weak;,it's 100 times weakernthan a fridge magnet,,and yet it affects the chemistry --nsomehow -- within a living organism.,That's not in doubt --na German couple of ornithologists,,Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,nin the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,,the robin does find its way by somehownsensing the Earth's magnetic field,,to give it directional information --na built-in compass. 
 The puzzle, the mystery was:nHow does it do it?,Well, the only theory in town --,we don't know if it's the correct theory,nbut the only theory in town --,is that it does it via somethingncalled quantum entanglement.,Inside the robin's retina --,I kid you not -- inside the robin's retinanis a protein called cryptochrome,,which is light-sensitive.,Within cryptochrome, a pair of electronsnare quantum-entangled.,Now, quantum entanglementnis when two particles are far apart,,and yet somehow remainnin contact with each other.,Even Einstein hated this idea;,he called it "spooky actionnat a distance." 
 (Laughter) 
 So if Einstein doesn't like it,nthen we can all be uncomfortable with it.,Two quantum-entangled electronsnwithin a single molecule,dance a delicate dance,that is very sensitivento the direction the bird flies,in the Earth's magnetic field. 
 We don't know if it'snthe correct explanation,,but wow, wouldn't it be excitingnif quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?,Quantum biology is still in it infancy.,It's still speculative.,But I believe it's built on solid science.,I also think thatnin the coming decade or so,,we're going to start to seenthat actually, it pervades life --,that life has evolved tricksnthat utilize the quantum world.,Watch this space. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)One of my earliest memories,is of trying to wake upnone of my relatives and not being able to.,And I was just a little kid,nso I didn't really understand why,,but as I got older,,I realized we hadndrug addiction in my family,,including later cocaine addiction. 
 I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,npartly because it's now exactly 100 years,since drugs were first bannednin the United States and Britain,,and we then imposed thatnon the rest of the world.,It's a century since we madenthis really fateful decision,to take addicts and punish themnand make them suffer,,because we believed that would deter them;nit would give them an incentive to stop. 
 And a few years ago, I was looking atnsome of the addicts in my life who I love,,and trying to figure outnif there was some way to help them.,And I realized there were loadsnof incredibly basic questions,I just didn't know the answer to,,like, what really causes addiction?,Why do we carry on with this approachnthat doesn't seem to be working,,and is there a better way out therenthat we could try instead? 
 So I read loads of stuff about it,,and I couldn't really findnthe answers I was looking for,,so I thought, okay, I'll go and sitnwith different people around the world,who lived this and studied this,and talk to them and seenif I could learn from them.,And I didn't realize I would end upngoing over 30,000 miles at the start,,but I ended up going and meetingnloads of different people,,from a transgender crack dealernin Brownsville, Brooklyn,,to a scientist who spends a lot of timenfeeding hallucinogens to mongooses,to see if they like them --,it turns out they do, but onlynin very specific circumstances --,to the only country that's everndecriminalized all drugs,,from cannabis to crack, Portugal.,And the thing I realizednthat really blew my mind is,,almost everything we thinknwe know about addiction is wrong,,and if we start to absorbnthe new evidence about addiction,,I think we're going to have to changena lot more than our drug policies. 
 But let's start with what we thinknwe know, what I thought I knew.,Let's think about this middle row here.,Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, wentnoff and used heroin three times a day.,Some of you look a little morenenthusiastic than others at this prospect.,(Laughter),Don't worry,nit's just a thought experiment.,Imagine you did that, right?,What would happen?,Now, we have a story about what wouldnhappen that we've been told for a century.,We think, because there arenchemical hooks in heroin,,as you took it for a while,,your body would becomendependent on those hooks,,you'd start to physically need them,,and at the end of those 20 days,nyou'd all be heroin addicts. Right?,That's what I thought. 
 First thing that alerted me to the factnthat something's not right with this story,is when it was explained to me.,If I step out of this TED Talk todaynand I get hit by a car and I break my hip,,I'll be taken to hospitalnand I'll be given loads of diamorphine.,Diamorphine is heroin.,It's actually much better heroinnthan you're going to buy on the streets,,because the stuff you buynfrom a drug dealer is contaminated.,Actually, very little of it is heroin,,whereas the stuff you getnfrom the doctor is medically pure.,And you'll be given it for quitena long period of time.,There are loads of people in this room,,you may not realize it,nyou've taken quite a lot of heroin.,And anyone who is watching thisnanywhere in the world, this is happening.,And if what we believenabout addiction is right --,those people are exposednto all those chemical hooks --,What should happen?nThey should become addicts.,This has been studied really carefully.,It doesn't happen; you will have noticednif your grandmother had a hip replacement,,she didn't come out as a junkie.n(Laughter) 
 And when I learned this,nit seemed so weird to me,,so contrary to everything I'd been told,neverything I thought I knew,,I just thought it couldn't be right,nuntil I met a man called Bruce Alexander.,He's a professornof psychology in Vancouver,who carried out an incredible experiment,I think really helps usnto understand this issue.,Professor Alexander explained to me,,the idea of addiction we've allngot in our heads, that story,,comes partly from a series of experiments,that were done earliernin the 20th century.,They're really simple.,You can do them tonight at homenif you feel a little sadistic.,You get a rat and you put it in a cage,nand you give it two water bottles:,One is just water, and the other is waternlaced with either heroin or cocaine.,If you do that, the rat will almost alwaysnprefer the drug water,and almost alwaysnkill itself quite quickly.,So there you go, right?nThat's how we think it works.,In the '70s, Professor Alexander comesnalong and he looks at this experiment,and he noticed something.,He said ah, we're puttingnthe rat in an empty cage.,It's got nothing to donexcept use these drugs.,Let's try something different.,So Professor Alexander built a cagenthat he called "Rat Park,",which is basically heaven for rats.,They've got loads of cheese,nthey've got loads of colored balls,,they've got loads of tunnels.,Crucially, they've got loads of friends.nThey can have loads of sex.,And they've got both the water bottles,nthe normal water and the drugged water.,But here's the fascinating thing:,In Rat Park, they don'tnlike the drug water.,They almost never use it.,None of them ever use it compulsively.,None of them ever overdose.,You go from almost 100 percent overdosenwhen they're isolated,to zero percent overdose when theynhave happy and connected lives. 
 Now, when he first saw this,nProfessor Alexander thought,,maybe this is just a thing about rats,nthey're quite different to us.,Maybe not as different as we'd like,nbut, you know --,But fortunately, there wasna human experiment,into the exact same principle happeningnat the exact same time.,It was called the Vietnam War.,In Vietnam, 20 percent of all Americanntroops were using loads of heroin,,and if you look at the newsnreports from the time,,they were really worried, becausenthey thought, my God, we're going to have,hundreds of thousands of junkiesnon the streets of the United States,when the war ends; it made total sense.,Now, those soldiers who were usingnloads of heroin were followed home.,The Archives of General Psychiatryndid a really detailed study,,and what happened to them?,It turns out they didn't go to rehab.nThey didn't go into withdrawal.,Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.,Now, if you believe the storynabout chemical hooks,,that makes absolutely no sense,nbut Professor Alexander began to think,there might be a differentnstory about addiction.,He said, what if addiction isn'tnabout your chemical hooks?,What if addiction is about your cage?,What if addiction is an adaptationnto your environment? 
 Looking at this,,there was another professorncalled Peter Cohen in the Netherlands,who said, maybe we shouldn'tneven call it addiction.,Maybe we should call it bonding.,Human beings have a naturalnand innate need to bond,,and when we're happy and healthy,nwe'll bond and connect with each other,,but if you can't do that,,because you're traumatized or isolatednor beaten down by life,,you will bond with somethingnthat will give you some sense of relief.,Now, that might be gambling,nthat might be pornography,,that might be cocaine,nthat might be cannabis,,but you will bond and connectnwith something because that's our nature.,That's what we want as human beings. 
 And at first, I found this quitena difficult thing to get my head around,,but one way that helped mento think about it is,,I can see, I've got over by my seatna bottle of water, right?,I'm looking at lots of you, and lotsnof you have bottles of water with you.,Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.,Totally legally, all of those bottlesnof water could be bottles of vodka, right?,We could all be getting drunk --nI might after this -- (Laughter) --,but we're not.,Now, because you've been able to affordnthe approximately gazillion pounds,that it costs to get into a TED Talk,nI'm guessing you guys could afford,to be drinking vodkanfor the next six months.,You wouldn't end up homeless.,You're not going to do that,nand the reason you're not going to do that,is not because anyone's stopping you.,It's because you've gotnbonds and connections,that you want to be present for.,You've got work you love.nYou've got people you love.,You've got healthy relationships.,And a core part of addiction,,I came to think, and I believenthe evidence suggests,,is about not being able to bearnto be present in your life. 
 Now, this has reallynsignificant implications.,The most obvious implicationsnare for the War on Drugs.,In Arizona, I went outnwith a group of women,who were made to wear t-shirtsnsaying, "I was a drug addict,",and go out on chain gangs and dig gravesnwhile members of the public jeer at them,,and when those women get out of prison,nthey're going to have criminal records,that mean they'll never worknin the legal economy again.,Now, that's a very extreme example,nobviously, in the case of the chain gang,,but actually almostneverywhere in the world,we treat addicts to some degree like that.,We punish them. We shame them.nWe give them criminal records.,We put barriers between them reconnecting.,There was a doctor in Canada,nDr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,,who said to me, if you wanted to designna system that would make addiction worse,,you would design that system. 
 Now, there's a place that decidednto do the exact opposite,,and I went there to see how it worked.,In the year 2000, Portugal hadnone of the worst drug problems in Europe.,One percent of the population was addictednto heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,,and every year, they triednthe American way more and more.,They punished people and stigmatized themnand shamed them more,,and every year, the problem got worse.,And one day, the Prime Minister andnthe leader of the opposition got together,,and basically said, look, we can't go on,with a country where we're havingnever more people becoming heroin addicts.,Let's set up a panelnof scientists and doctors,to figure out what wouldngenuinely solve the problem.,And they set up a panel led bynan amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,,to look at all this new evidence,,and they came back and they said,,"Decriminalize all drugsnfrom cannabis to crack, but" --,and this is the crucial next step --,"take all the money we used to spendnon cutting addicts off,,on disconnecting them,,and spend it insteadnon reconnecting them with society.",And that's not really what we think ofnas drug treatment,in the United States and Britain.,So they do do residential rehab,,they do psychological therapy,nthat does have some value.,But the biggest thing they didnwas the complete opposite of what we do:,a massive programnof job creation for addicts,,and microloans for addictsnto set up small businesses.,So say you used to be a mechanic.,When you're ready, they'll gonto a garage, and they'll say,,if you employ this guy for a year,nwe'll pay half his wages.,The goal was to make surenthat every addict in Portugal,had something to get outnof bed for in the morning.,And when I went and met the addictsnin Portugal,,what they said is,nas they rediscovered purpose,,they rediscovered bondsnand relationships with the wider society. 
 It'll be 15 years this yearnsince that experiment began,,and the results are in:,injecting drug use is down in Portugal,,according to the BritishnJournal of Criminology,,by 50 percent, five-zero percent.,Overdose is massively down,nHIV is massively down among addicts.,Addiction in every studynis significantly down.,One of the ways you know it's workednso well is that almost nobody in Portugal,wants to go back to the old system. 
 Now, that's the political implications.,I actually think there's a layernof implications,to all this research below that.,We live in a culture where peoplenfeel really increasingly vulnerable,to all sorts of addictions,nwhether it's to their smartphones,or to shopping or to eating.,Before these talks began --nyou guys know this --,we were told we weren't allowednto have our smartphones on,,and I have to say, a lot of younlooked an awful lot like,addicts who were told their dealernwas going to be unavailable,for the next couple of hours. (Laughter),A lot of us feel like that,nand it might sound weird to say,,I've been talking about how disconnectionnis a major driver of addiction,and weird to say it's growing,,because you think we're the most connectednsociety that's ever been, surely.,But I increasingly began to thinknthat the connections we have,or think we have, are like a kindnof parody of human connection.,If you have a crisis in your life,nyou'll notice something.,It won't be your Twitter followersnwho come to sit with you.,It won't be your Facebook friendsnwho help you turn it round.,It'll be your flesh and blood friendsnwho you have deep and nuanced,and textured, face-to-facenrelationships with,,and there's a study I learned about fromnBill McKibben, the environmental writer,,that I think tells us a lot about this.,It looked at the number of close friendsnthe average American believes,they can call on in a crisis.,That number has been decliningnsteadily since the 1950s.,The amount of floor spacenan individual has in their home,has been steadily increasing,,and I think that's like a metaphor,for the choice we've made as a culture.,We've traded floorspace for friends,nwe've traded stuff for connections,,and the result is we are one of thenloneliest societies there has ever been.,And Bruce Alexander, the guy who didnthe Rat Park experiment, says,,we talk all the time in addictionnabout individual recovery,,and it's right to talk about that,,but we need to talk much morenabout social recovery.,Something's gone wrong with us,nnot just with individuals but as a group,,and we've created a society where,nfor a lot of us,,life looks a whole lot morenlike that isolated cage,and a whole lot less like Rat Park. 
 If I'm honest, this isn'tnwhy I went into it.,I didn't go in to the discovernthe political stuff, the social stuff.,I wanted to know how to helpnthe people I love.,And when I came back from thisnlong journey and I'd learned all this,,I looked at the addicts in my life,,and if you're really candid,nit's hard loving an addict,,and there's going to be lots of peoplenwho know in this room.,You are angry a lot of the time,,and I think one of the reasonsnwhy this debate is so charged,is because it runs through the heartnof each of us, right?,Everyone has a bit of themnthat looks at an addict and thinks,,I wish someone would just stop you.,And the kind of scripts we're told for hownto deal with the addicts in our lives,is typified by, I think,,the reality show "Intervention,"nif you guys have ever seen it.,I think everything in our livesnis defined by reality TV,,but that's another TED Talk.,If you've ever seennthe show "Intervention,",it's a pretty simple premise.,Get an addict, all the peoplenin their life, gather them together,,confront them with what they're doing,nand they say, if you don't shape up,,we're going to cut you off.,So what they do is they takenthe connection to the addict,,and they threaten it,nthey make it contingent,on the addict behaving the way they want.,And I began to think, I began to seenwhy that approach doesn't work,,and I began to think that's almost likenthe importing of the logic of the Drug War,into our private lives. 
 So I was thinking,nhow could I be Portuguese?,And what I've tried to do now,nand I can't tell you I do it consistently,and I can't tell you it's easy,,is to say to the addicts in my life,that I want to deepennthe connection with them,,to say to them, I love younwhether you're using or you're not.,I love you, whatever state you're in,,and if you need me,nI'll come and sit with you,because I love you and I don'tnwant you to be alone,or to feel alone. 
 And I think the core of that message --,you're not alone, we love you --,has to be at every levelnof how we respond to addicts,,socially, politically and individually.,For 100 years now, we've been singingnwar songs about addicts.,I think all along we should have beennsinging love songs to them,,because the opposite of addictionnis not sobriety.,The opposite of addiction is connection. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the early days of Twitter,nit was like a place of radical de-shaming.,People would admitnshameful secrets about themselves,,and other people would say,n"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same.",Voiceless people realizednthat they had a voice,,and it was powerful and eloquent.,If a newspaper ran some racistnor homophobic column,,we realized we could donsomething about it.,We could get them.,We could hit them with a weaponnthat we understood but they didn't --,a social media shaming.,Advertisers would withdrawntheir advertising.,When powerful peoplenmisused their privilege,,we were going to get them.,This was like thendemocratization of justice.,Hierarchies were being leveled out.,We were going to do things better. 
 Soon after that, a disgracednpop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --,he'd been caught plagiarizingnand faking quotes,,and he was drenched in shamenand regret, he told me.,And he had the opportunity,to publicly apologizenat a foundation lunch.,This was going to be the mostnimportant speech of his life.,Maybe it would win him some salvation.,He knew before he arrived,that the foundation was going to benlive-streaming his event,,but what he didn't knownuntil he turned up,,was that they'd erected a giant screennTwitter feed right next to his head.,(Laughter),Another one in a monitor screennin his eye line. 
 I don't think the foundation did thisnbecause they were monstrous.,I think they were clueless:nI think this was a unique moment,when the beautiful naivety of Twitter,was hitting the increasinglynhorrific reality. 
 And here were some of the Tweetsnthat were cascading into his eye line,,as he was trying to apologize: 
 "Jonah Lehrer, boring usninto forgiving him.",(Laughter) 
 And, "Jonah Lehrer has not provennthat he is capable of feeling shame." 
 That one must have been writtennby the best psychiatrist ever,,to know that about suchna tiny figure behind a lectern. 
 And, "Jonah Lehrer is justna frigging sociopath." 
 That last word is a very human thingnto do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.,It's because we want to destroy peoplenbut not feel bad about it.,Imagine if this was an actual court,,and the accused was in the dark,nbegging for another chance,,and the jury was yelling out,,"Bored! Sociopath!",(Laughter) 
 You know, when we watchncourtroom dramas, we tend to identify,with the kindhearted defense attorney,,but give us the power,nand we become like hanging judges. 
 Power shifts fast.,We were getting Jonah because he wasnperceived to have misused his privilege,,but Jonah was on the floor then,nand we were still kicking,,and congratulating ourselvesnfor punching up.,And it began to feel weird and emptynwhen there wasn't a powerful person,who had misused their privilegenthat we could get.,A day without a shamingnbegan to feel like a day,picking fingernails and treading water. 
 Let me tell you a story.,It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.,She was a PR woman from New Yorknwith 170 Twitter followers,,and she'd Tweet littlenacerbic jokes to them,,like this one on a planenfrom New York to London:,[Weird German Dude: You're in first class.nIt's 2014. Get some deodorant.",-Inner monologue as inhale BO.nThank god for pharmaceuticals.],So Justine chuckled to herself,nand pressed send, and got no replies,,and felt that sad feeling that we all feel,when the Internet doesn'tncongratulate us for being funny.,(Laughter),Black silence when the Internetndoesn't talk back.,And then she got to Heathrow,nand she had a little time to spare,before her final leg, so she thought upnanother funny little acerbic joke: 
 [Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS.nJust kidding. I'm white!] 
 And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,ngot on the plane, got no replies,,turned off her phone, fell asleep,,woke up 11 hours later,,turned on her phone while the planenwas taxiing on the runway,,and straightaway there wasna message from somebody,that she hadn't spokennto since high school,,that said, "I am so sorrynto see what's happening to you.",And then another messagenfrom a best friend,,"You need to call me right now.,You are the worldwide number onentrending topic on Twitter.",(Laughter) 
 What had happened is that onenof her 170 followers had sent the Tweet,to a Gawker journalist, and henretweeted it to his 15,000 followers:,[And now, a funny holiday jokenfrom IAC's PR boss],And then it was like a bolt of lightning.,A few weeks later, I talkednto the Gawker journalist.,I emailed him and asked him how it felt,nand he said, "It felt delicious.",And then he said,n"But I'm sure she's fine." 
 But she wasn't fine,nbecause while she slept,,Twitter took control of her lifenand dismantled it piece by piece.,First there were the philanthropists:,[If @JustineSacco's unfortunatenwords ... bother you,,join me in supportingn@CARE's work in Africa.],[In light of ... disgusting,nracist tweet, I'm donating to @care today],Then came the beyond horrified:,[... no words for that horribly disgustingnracist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.,I am beyond horrified.] 
 Was anybody on Twitternthat night? A few of you.,Did Justine's joke overwhelmnyour Twitter feed the way it did mine?,It did mine, and I thoughtnwhat everybody thought that night,,which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!,Somebody's life is about to get terrible!",And I sat up in my bed,,and I put the pillow behind my head,,and then I thought, I'm not entirely surenthat joke was intended to be racist.,Maybe instead of gleefullynflaunting her privilege,,she was mocking the gleefulnflaunting of privilege.,There's a comedy tradition of this,,like South Park or Colbertnor Randy Newman.,Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not beingnas good at it as Randy Newman.,In fact, when I met Justinena couple of weeks later in a bar,,she was just crushed,,and I asked her to explain the joke,,and she said, "Living in Americanputs us in a bit of a bubble,when it comes to what is going onnin the Third World.,I was making of fun of that bubble." 
 You know, another woman on Twitter thatnnight, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,,she reviewed my book on public shamingnand wrote that she Tweeted that night,,"I'm not sure that her jokenwas intended to be racist,",and she said straightaway she gotna fury of Tweets saying,,"Well, you're justna privileged bitch, too.",And so to her shame, she wrote,,she shut up and watchednas Justine's life got torn apart. 
 It started to get darker:,[Everyone go reportnthis cunt @JustineSacco],Then came the calls for her to be fired.,[Good luck with the job huntnin the new year. #GettingFired],Thousands of people around the world,decided it was their dutynto get her fired.,[@JustineSacco last tweetnof your career. #SorryNotSorry,Corporations got involved,nhoping to sell their products,on the back of Justine's annihilation:,[Next time you plan to tweet somethingnstupid before you take off,,make sure you are gettingnon a @Gogo flight!],(Laughter) 
 A lot of companies were makingngood money that night.,You know, Justine's name was normallynGoogled 40 times a month.,That month, between December the 20thnand the end of December,,her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.,And one Internet economist told menthat that meant that Google made,somewhere between 120,000 dollarsnand 468,000 dollars,from Justine's annihilation, whereasnthose of us doing the actual shaming --,we got nothing.,(Laughter),We were like unpaidnshaming interns for Google.,(Laughter) 
 And then came the trolls:,[I'm actually kind of hopingnJustine Sacco gets aids? lol],Somebody else on that wrote,,"Somebody HIV-positive should rapenthis bitch and then we'll find out,if her skin color protects her from AIDS.",And that person got a free pass.,Nobody went after that person.,We were all so excitednabout destroying Justine,,and our shaming brainsnare so simple-minded,,that we couldn't also handlendestroying somebody,who was inappropriatelyndestroying Justine.,Justine was really unitingna lot of disparate groups that night,,from philanthropists to "rape the bitch.",[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!nYou demented bitch...,Just let the world know you're planningnto ride bare back while in Africa.] 
 Women always have it worse than men.,When a man gets shamed, it's,n"I'm going to get you fired.",When a woman gets shamed, it's,,"I'm going to get you firednand raped and cut out your uterus." 
 And then Justine's employers got involved:,[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is annoutrageous, offensive comment.,Employee in question currentlynunreachable on an intl flight.],And that's when the angernturned to excitement:,[All I want for Christmas is to seen@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands,and she checksnher inbox/voicemail. #fired],[Oh man, @justinesacconis going to have the most painful,phone-turning-on moment evernwhen her plane lands.],[We are about to watch this @JustineSacconbitch get fired. In REAL time.,Before she even KNOWSnshe's getting fired.],What we had wasna delightful narrative arc.,We knew something that Justine didn't.,Can you think of anythingnless judicial than this?,Justine was asleep on a planenand unable to explain herself,,and her inability wasna huge part of the hilarity.,On Twitter that night, we werenlike toddlers crawling towards a gun.,Somebody worked out exactlynwhich plane she was on, so they linked,to a flight tracker website.,[British Airways Flight 43nOn-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes],A hashtag began trending worldwide:,# hasJustineLandedYet?,[It is kinda wildnto see someone self-destruct,without them even being aware of it.n#hasJustineLandedYet],[Seriously. I just want to go homento go to bed, but everyone at the bar,is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.nCan't look away. Can't leave.],[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the bestnthing to happen to my Friday night.],[Is no one in Cape Town goingnto the airport to tweet her arrival?,Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures],And guess what? Yes there was.,[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landednat Cape Town international.,And if you want to knownwhat it looks like to discover,that you've just been torn to shredsnbecause of a misconstrued liberal joke,,not by trolls, but by nice people like us,,this is what it looks like:,[... She's decided to wearnsunnies as a disguise.] 
 So why did we do it?,I think some people were genuinely upset,,but I think for other people,,it's because Twitter is basicallyna mutual approval machine.,We surround ourselves with peoplenwho feel the same way we do,,and we approve each other,,and that's a really good feeling.,And if somebody gets in the way,nwe screen them out.,And do you know whatnthat's the opposite of?,It's the opposite of democracy.,We wanted to show that we carednabout people dying of AIDS in Africa.,Our desire to be seen to be compassionatenis what led us to commit,this profoundly un-compassionate act.,As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrotenin the Boston Review,,"This isn't social justice.nIt's a cathartic alternative." 
 For the past three years,,I've been going around the worldnmeeting people like Justine Sacco --,and believe me, there's a lotnof people like Justine Sacco.,There's more every day.,And we want to think they're fine,nbut they're not fine.,The people I met were mangled.,They talked to me about depression,,and anxiety and insomnianand suicidal thoughts.,One woman I talked to,nwho also told a joke that landed badly,,she stayed home for a year and a half.,Before that, she worked with adultsnwith learning difficulties,,and was apparently really good at her job. 
 Justine was fired, of course,nbecause social media demanded it.,But it was worse than that.,She was losing herself.,She was waking up in the middlenof the night, forgetting who she was.,She was got because she was perceivednto have misused her privilege.,And of course, that's a much better thingnto get people for than the things,we used to get people for,nlike having children out of wedlock.,But the phrase "misuse of privilege"nis becoming a free pass,to tear apart pretty muchnanybody we choose to.,It's becoming a devalued term,,and it's making us losenour capacity for empathy,and for distinguishing between seriousnand unserious transgressions. 
 Justine had 170 Twitter followers,nand so to make it work,,she had to be fictionalized.,Word got around that she was the daughternthe mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.,[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacconher father is a SA mining billionaire.,She's not sorry.nAnd neither is her father.],I thought that was true about Justine,,until I met her at a bar, and I asked hernabout her billionaire father,,and she said, "My father sells carpets." 
 And I think back onnthe early days of Twitter,,when people would admitnshameful secrets about themselves,,and other people would say,n"Oh my God, I'm exactly the same.",These days, the hunt is onnfor people's shameful secrets.,You can lead a good, ethical life,,but some bad phraseology in a Tweetncan overwhelm it all,,become a clue to your secret inner evil. 
 Maybe there's two typesnof people in the world:,those people who favornhumans over ideology,,and those people who favornideology over humans.,I favor humans over ideology,,but right now, the ideologues are winning,,and they're creating a stagenfor constant artificial high dramas,where everybody's eitherna magnificent hero,or a sickening villain,,even though we know that's not truenabout our fellow humans.,What's true is thatnwe are clever and stupid;,what's true is that we're grey areas.,The great thing about social medianwas how it gave a voice,to voiceless people,,but we're now creatingna surveillance society,,where the smartest way to survivenis to go back to being voiceless. 
 Let's not do that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon. 
 Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno. 
 BG: Don't go away.,What strikes me about Justine's story,is also the fact that if younGoogle her name today,,this story covers the firstn100 pages of Google results --,there is nothing else about her.,In your book, you mention another story,of another victim who actually gotntaken on by a reputation management firm,,and by creating blogs and posting nice,ninnocuous stories about her love for cats,and holidays and stuff,nmanaged to get the story,off the first couple pages of Googlenresults, but it didn't last long.,A couple of weeks later, they startedncreeping back up to the top result.,Is this a totally lost battle? 
 Jon Ronson: You know, I thinknthe very best thing we can do,,if you see a kind of unfairnor an ambiguous shaming,,is to speak up, because I thinknthe worst thing that happened to Justine,was that nobody supported her --nlike, everyone was against her,,and that is profoundly traumatizing,,to be told by tens of thousands of peoplenthat you need to get out.,But if a shaming happens and there'sna babble of voices, like in a democracy,,where people are discussing it,nI think that's much less damaging.,So I think that's the way forward,,but it's hard, because if you donstand up for somebody,,it's incredibly unpleasant. 
 BG: So let's talk about your experience,,because you stood up by writing this book.,By the way, it's mandatorynreading for everybody, okay?,You stood up because the booknactually puts the spotlight on shamers.,And I assume you didn't onlynhave friendly reactions on Twitter. 
 JR: It didn't go down that wellnwith some people.,(Laughter),I mean, you don't wantnto just concentrate --,because lots of people understood,nand were really nice about the book.,But yeah, for 30 years I've been writingnstories about abuses of power,,and when I say the powerful peoplenover there in the military,,or in the pharmaceutical industry,neverybody applauds me.,As soon as I say, "We are the powerfulnpeople abusing our power now,",I get people saying,n"Well you must be a racist too." 
 BG: So the other night --nyesterday -- we were at dinner,,and there were two discussions going on.,On one side you were talkingnwith people around the table --,and that was a nice,nconstructive discussion.,On the other, every timenyou turned to your phone,,there is this deluge of insults. 
 JR: Yeah. This happened last night.nWe had like a TED dinner last night.,We were chatting and it was lovelynand nice, and I decided to check Twitter.,Somebody said, "You arena white supremacist.",And then I went back and hadna nice conversation with somebody,,and then I went back to Twitter,,somebody said my very existencenmade the world a worse place.,My friend Adam Curtis says,that maybe the Internet is likena John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,,when eventually everyonenwill start screaming at each other,and shooting each other,nand then eventually everybody,would flee to somewhere safer,,and I'm starting to think of thatnas a really nice option. 
 BG: Jon, thank you.nJR: Thank you, Bruno. 
 (Applause)In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,,boarded a flight from Minneapolis,to the Horn of Africa.,And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,,he was not alone.,Al-Shabaab managed to recruitnover two dozen young men,in their late teens and early 20s,with a heavy presencenon social media platforms like Facebook.,With the Internet and other technologies,,they've changed our everyday lives,,but they've also changednrecruitment, radicalization,and the front lines of conflict today. 
 What about the links connecting Twitter,,Google and protestersnfighting for democracy?,These numbers representnGoogle's public DNS servers,,effectively the onlyndigital border crossing,protesters had and could use,to communicate with each other,nto reach the outside world,and to spread viral awareness,of what was happeningnin their own country. 
 Today, conflict is essentially borderless.,If there are bounds to conflict today,,they're bound by digital,nnot physical geography.,And under all this is a vacuum of power,where non-state actors, individualsnand private organizations,have the advantage over slow, outdatednmilitary and intelligence agencies.,And this is because,nin the digital age of conflict,,there exists a feedback loop,where new technologies,nplatforms like the ones I mentioned,,and more disruptive ones,,can be adapted, learned, and deployednby individuals and organizations,faster than governments can react. 
 To understand the pacenof our own government thinking on this,,I like to turn to something aptly named,the Worldwide Threat Assessment,,where every year the Directornof National Intelligence in the US,looks at the global threat landscape,,and he says, "These are the threats,nthese are the details,,and this is how we rank them.",In 2007, there was absolutelynno mention of cyber security.,It took until 2011,nwhen it came at the end,,where other things, like WestnAfrican drug trafficking, took precedence.,In 2012, it crept up, still behind thingsnlike terrorism and proliferation.,In 2013, it became the top threat,,in 2014 and for the foreseeable future. 
 What things like that show us,is that there isna fundamental inability today,on the part of governmentsnto adapt and learn in digital conflict,,where conflict can be immaterial,nborderless, often wholly untraceable.,And conflict isn't just online to offline,nas we see with terrorist radicalization,,but it goes the other way as well. 
 We all know the horrible eventsnthat unfolded in Paris this year,with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.,What an individual hacker or a small groupnof anonymous individuals did,was enter those social media conversationsnthat so many of us took part in.,#JeSuisCharlie.,On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,,all sorts of places where millionsnof people, myself included,,were talking about the events,and saw images like this,,the emotional, poignant image of a babynwith "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.,And this turned into a weapon.,What the hackers didnwas weaponize this image,,where unsuspecting victims,,like all of us in those conversations,,saw this image, downloaded it,but it was embedded with malware.,And so when you downloaded this image,,it hacked your system.,It took six days to deployna global malware campaign.,The divide between physicalnand digital domains today,ceases to exist,,where we have offline attacksnlike those in Paris,appropriated for online hacks. 
 And it goes the other way as well,nwith recruitment.,We see online radicalization of teens,,who can then be deployed globallynfor offline terrorist attacks. 
 With all of this, we see that there'sna new 21st century battle brewing,,and governmentsndon't necessarily take a part. 
 So in another case,nAnonymous vs. Los Zetas.,In early September 2011 in Mexico,,Los Zetas, one of the mostnpowerful drug cartels,,hung two bloggers with a sign that said,,"This is what will happennto all Internet busybodies.",A week later, they beheaded a young girl.,They severed her head,nput it on top of her computer,with a similar note.,And taking the digital counteroffensive,because governments couldn't evennunderstand what was going on or act,,Anonymous, a group we might not associatenas the most positive force in the world,,took action,,not in cyber attacks, but threateningninformation to be free.,On social media, they said,,"We will release information,that ties prosecutors and governorsnto corrupt drug deals with the cartel.",And escalating that conflict,,Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 peoplenfor every bit of information you release.",And so it ended there becausenit would become too gruesome to continue.,But what was powerful about this,was that anonymous individuals,,not federal policia,nnot military, not politicians,,could strike fear deep into the heart,of one of the most powerful,nviolent organizations in the world.,And so we live in an era,that lacks the claritynof the past in conflict,,in who we're fighting,nin the motivations behind attacks,,in the tools and techniques used,,and how quickly they evolve.,And the question still remains:,what can individuals,norganizations and governments do? 
 For answers to these questions,nit starts with individuals,,and I think peer-to-peer securitynis the answer.,Those people in relationshipsnthat bought over teens online,,we can do that with peer-to-peer security.,Individuals have more powernthan ever before,to affect nationalnand international security.,And we can create those positivenpeer-to-peer relationships,on and offline,,we can support and educate the nextngeneration of hackers, like myself,,instead of saying, "You can either bena criminal or join the NSA.",That matters today.,And it's not just individuals --nit's organizations, corporations even.,They have an advantagento act across more borders,,more effectively and more rapidlynthan governments can,,and there's a setnof real incentives there.,It's profitable and valuable,to be seen as trustworthynin the digital age,,and will only be more sonin future generations to come. 
 But we still can't ignore government,,because that's who we turn tonfor collective action,to keep us safe and secure.,But we see where that's gotten us so far,,where there's an inability to adaptnand learn in digital conflict,,where at the highest levels of leadership,,the Director of the CIA,nSecretary of Defense,,they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen."n"Cyber 9/11 is imminent.",But this only makes usnmore fearful, not more secure.,By banning encryption in favornof mass surveillance and mass hacking,,sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.,But that doesn't meannthat they're the only ones that can.,Capabilities are cheap, even free.,Technical abilitynis rising around the world,,and individuals and small groupsnhave the advantage.,So today it might just benthe NSA and GCHQ,,but who's to say that the Chinesencan't find that backdoor?,Or in another generation,nsome kid in his basement in Estonia? 
 And so I would say that it'snnot what governments can do,,it's that they can't.,Governments todaynneed to give up power and control,in order to help make us more secure.,Giving up mass surveillance and hackingnand instead fixing those backdoors,means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,,but neither can the Chinese,or that hacker in Estoniana generation from now.,And government supportnfor technologies like Tor and Bitcoin,mean giving up control,,but it means that developers, translators,nanybody with an Internet connection,,in countries like Cuba, Iran and China,ncan sell their skills, their products,,in the global marketplace,,but more importantly sell their ideas,,show us what's happeningnin their own countries. 
 And so it should be not fearful,,it should be inspiringnto the same governments,that fought for civil rights,nfree speech and democracy,in the great wars of the last century,,that today, for the first timenin human history,,we have a technical opportunity,to make billions of peoplensafer around the world,that we've never had beforenin human history.,It should be inspiring. 
 (Applause)This is a painting from the 16th centurynfrom Lucas Cranach the Elder.,It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.,If you drink its water or you bathe in it,nyou will get health and youth.,Every culture, every civilizationnhas dreamed of finding eternal youth.,There are people like Alexander the Greatnor Ponce De León, the explorer,,who spent much of their lifenchasing the Fountain of Youth.,They didn't find it.,But what if there was something to it?,What if there was somethingnto this Fountain of Youth? 
 I will share an absolutely amazingndevelopment in aging research,that could revolutionizenthe way we think about aging,and how we may treat age-relatedndiseases in the future.,It started with experiments that showed,,in a recent numbernof studies about growing,,that animals -- old mice --nthat share a blood supply with young mice,can get rejuvenated.,This is similar to what you might seenin humans, in Siamese twins,,and I know this sounds a bit creepy.,But what Tom Rando, a stem-cellnresearcher, reported in 2007,,was that old muscle from a mousencan be rejuvenated,if it's exposed to young bloodnthrough common circulation.,This was reproduced by Amy Wagersnat Harvard a few years later,,and others then showed that similarnrejuvenating effects could be observed,in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.,But what I'm most excited about,nand several other labs as well,,is that this may even apply to the brain. 
 So, what we found is that an old mousenexposed to a young environment,in this model called parabiosis,,shows a younger brain --,and a brain that functions better.,And I repeat:,an old mouse that gets young bloodnthrough shared circulation,looks younger and functionsnyounger in its brain.,So when we get older --,we can look at different aspectsnof human cognition,,and you can see on this slide here,,we can look at reasoning,nverbal ability and so forth.,And up to around age 50 or 60,nthese functions are all intact,,and as I look at the young audiencenhere in the room, we're all still fine. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's scary to seenhow all these curves go south.,And as we get older,,diseases such as Alzheimer'snand others may develop.,We know that with age,nthe connections between neurons --,the way neurons talk to each other,nthe synapses -- they start to deteriorate;,neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,,and there's an increased susceptibilitynfor these neurodegenerative diseases. 
 One big problem we have -- to trynto understand how this really works,at a very molecular mechanistic level --,is that we can't study the brainsnin detail, in living people.,We can do cognitive tests,nwe can do imaging --,all kinds of sophisticated testing.,But we usually have to waitnuntil the person dies,to get the brain and look at how it reallynchanged through age or in a disease.,This is what neuropathologistsndo, for example.,So, how about we think of the brainnas being part of the larger organism.,Could we potentially understand more,about what happens in the brainnat the molecular level,if we see the brainnas part of the entire body?,So if the body ages or gets sick,ndoes that affect the brain?,And vice versa: as the brain gets older,ndoes that influence the rest of the body?,And what connects all the differentntissues in the body,is blood.,Blood is the tissue that not only carriesncells that transport oxygen, for example,,the red blood cells,,or fights infectious diseases,,but it also carries messenger molecules,,hormone-like factorsnthat transport information,from one cell to another,nfrom one tissue to another,,including the brain.,So if we look at how the bloodnchanges in disease or age,,can we learn something about the brain?,We know that as we get older,nthe blood changes as well,,so these hormone-like factorsnchange as we get older.,And by and large,nfactors that we know are required,for the development of tissues,nfor the maintenance of tissues --,they start to decrease as we get older,,while factors involved in repair,nin injury and in inflammation --,they increase as we get older. 
 So there's this unbalance of goodnand bad factors, if you will.,And to illustrate what we can donpotentially with that,,I want to talk you throughnan experiment that we did.,We had almost 300 blood samplesnfrom healthy human beings,20 to 89 years of age,,and we measured over 100nof these communication factors,,these hormone-like proteins thatntransport information between tissues.,And what we noticed first,is that between the youngestnand the oldest group,,about half the factorsnchanged significantly.,So our body lives in a veryndifferent environment as we get older,,when it comes to these factors.,And using statisticalnor bioinformatics programs,,we could try to discovernthose factors that best predict age --,in a way, back-calculatenthe relative age of a person.,And the way this looksnis shown in this graph.,So, on the one axis you seenthe actual age a person lived,,the chronological age.,So, how many years they lived. 
 And then we take these top factorsnthat I showed you,,and we calculate their relative age,ntheir biological age.,And what you see is thatnthere is a pretty good correlation,,so we can pretty well predictnthe relative age of a person.,But what's really excitingnare the outliers,,as they so often are in life.,You can see here, the personnI highlighted with the green dot,is about 70 years of age,but seems to have a biological age,nif what we're doing here is really true,,of only about 45.,So is this a person that actuallynlooks much younger than their age?,But more importantly: Is this a personnwho is maybe at a reduced risk,to develop an age-related diseasenand will have a long life --,will live to 100 or more?,On the other hand, the person here,nhighlighted with the red dot,,is not even 40,nbut has a biological age of 65.,Is this a person at an increased risknof developing an age-related disease?,So in our lab, we're tryingnto understand these factors better,,and many other groupsnare trying to understand,,what are the true aging factors,,and can we learn something about themnto possibly predict age-related diseases? 
 So what I've shown you so farnis simply correlational, right?,You can just say,n"Well, these factors change with age,",but you don't really knownif they do something about aging.,So what I'm going to show you nownis very remarkable,and it suggests that these factorsncan actually modulate the age of a tissue.,And that's where we come backnto this model called parabiosis. 
 So, parabiosis is done in mice,by surgically connectingnthe two mice together,,and that leads thennto a shared blood system,,where we can now ask,n"How does the old brain get influenced,by exposure to the young blood?",And for this purpose, we use young mice,that are an equivalencynof 20-year-old people,,and old mice that are roughlyn65 years old in human years. 
 What we found is quite remarkable.,We find there are more neural stem cellsnthat make new neurons,in these old brains.,There's an increasednactivity of the synapses,,the connections between neurons.,There are more genes expressednthat are known to be involved,in the formation of new memories.,And there's less of this bad inflammation.,But we observed that there are no cellsnentering the brains of these animals.,So when we connect them,,there are actually no cellsngoing into the old brain, in this model.,Instead, we've reasoned, then,nthat it must be the soluble factors,,so we could collect simply the solublenfraction of blood which is called plasma,,and inject either young plasmanor old plasma into these mice,,and we could reproducenthese rejuvenating effects,,but what we could also do now,is we could do memory tests with mice. 
 As mice get older, like us humans,nthey have memory problems.,It's just harder to detect them,,but I'll show you in a minutenhow we do that.,But we wanted to take thisnone step further,,one step closer to potentiallynbeing relevant to humans.,What I'm showing you nownare unpublished studies,,where we used human plasma,nyoung human plasma,,and as a control, saline,,and injected it into old mice,,and asked, can we againnrejuvenate these old mice?,Can we make them smarter? 
 And to do this, we used a test.nIt's called a Barnes maze.,This is a big tablenthat has lots of holes in it,,and there are guide marks around it,,and there's a bright light,nas on this stage here.,The mice hate this and they try to escape,,and find the single hole that you seenpointed at with an arrow,,where a tube is mounted underneath,where they can escapenand feel comfortable in a dark hole.,So we teach them, over several days,,to find this spacenon these cues in the space,,and you can compare this for humans,,to finding your car in a parking lotnafter a busy day of shopping. 
 (Laughter) 
 Many of us have probably hadnsome problems with that. 
 So, let's look at an old mouse here.,This is an old mousenthat has memory problems,,as you'll notice in a moment.,It just looks into every hole,nbut it didn't form this spacial map,that would remind it where it wasnin the previous trial or the last day.,In stark contrast, this mouse herenis a sibling of the same age,,but it was treated with youngnhuman plasma for three weeks,,with small injections every three days.,And as you noticed, it almostnlooks around, "Where am I?" --,and then walks straightnto that hole and escapes.,So, it could remember where that hole was. 
 So by all means, this old mousenseems to be rejuvenated --,it functions more like a younger mouse.,And it also suggestsnthat there is something,not only in young mouse plasma,nbut in young human plasma,that has the capacitynto help this old brain.,So to summarize,,we find the old mouse, and its brainnin particular, are malleable.,They're not set in stone;nwe can actually change them.,It can be rejuvenated.,Young blood factors can reverse aging,,and what I didn't show you --,in this model, the young mouse actuallynsuffers from exposure to the old.,So there are old-blood factorsnthat can accelerate aging.,And most importantly,nhumans may have similar factors,,because we can take young humannblood and have a similar effect.,Old human blood, I didn't show you,ndoes not have this effect;,it does not make the mice younger. 
 So, is this magic transferable to humans?,We're running a smallnclinical study at Stanford,,where we treat Alzheimer's patientsnwith mild disease,with a pint of plasmanfrom young volunteers, 20-year-olds,,and do this once a week for four weeks,,and then we looknat their brains with imaging.,We test them cognitively,,and we ask their caregiversnfor daily activities of living.,What we hope is that there arensome signs of improvement,from this treatment.,And if that's the case,nthat could give us hope,that what I showed you works in mice,might also work in humans. 
 Now, I don't think we will live forever.,But maybe we discovered,that the Fountain of Youthnis actually within us,,and it has just dried out.,And if we can turn itnback on a little bit,,maybe we can find the factorsnthat are mediating these effects,,we can produce these factors synthetically,and we can treat diseases of aging,nsuch as Alzheimer's disease,or other dementias. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Roy Price is a man that most of younhave probably never heard about,,even though he may have been responsible,for 22 somewhat mediocre nminutes of your life on April 19, 2013.,He may have also been responsiblenfor 22 very entertaining minutes,,but not very many of you.,And all of that goes back to a decision,that Roy had to makenabout three years ago. 
 So you see, Roy Pricenis a senior executive with Amazon Studios.,That's the TV productionncompany of Amazon.,He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair,,describes himself on Twitternas "movies, TV, technology, tacos.",And Roy Price has a very responsible job,nbecause it's his responsibility,to pick the shows, the original contentnthat Amazon is going to make.,And of course that'sna highly competitive space.,I mean, there are so manynTV shows already out there,,that Roy can't just choose any show.,He has to find showsnthat are really, really great.,So in other words, he has to find shows,that are on the very right endnof this curve here. 
 So this curve herenis the rating distribution,of about 2,500 TV showsnon the website IMDB,,and the rating goes from one to 10,,and the height here shows younhow many shows get that rating.,So if your show gets a ratingnof nine points or higher, that's a winner.,Then you have a top two percent show.,That's shows like "Breaking Bad,"n"Game of Thrones," "The Wire,",so all of these shows that are addictive,,whereafter you've watched a season,nyour brain is basically like,,"Where can I get more of these episodes?",That kind of show.,On the left side, just for clarity,nhere on that end,,you have a show calledn"Toddlers and Tiaras" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 -- which should tell you enough,about what's going onnon that end of the curve. 
 Now, Roy Price is not worried aboutngetting on the left end of the curve,,because I think you would have to havensome serious brainpower,to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras.",So what he's worried aboutnis this middle bulge here,,the bulge of average TV,,you know, those showsnthat aren't really good or really bad,,they don't really get you excited.,So he needs to make surenthat he's really on the right end of this. 
 So the pressure is on,,and of course it's also the first time,that Amazon is evenndoing something like this,,so Roy Price does not wantnto take any chances.,He wants to engineer success.,He needs a guaranteed success,,and so what he does is,nhe holds a competition. 
 So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows,,and from those ideas,nthrough an evaluation,,they select eight candidates for TV shows,,and then he just makes the first episodenof each one of these shows,and puts them online for freenfor everyone to watch.,And so when Amazonnis giving out free stuff,,you're going to take it, right?,So millions of viewersnare watching those episodes. 
 What they don't realize is that,nwhile they're watching their shows,,actually, they are being watched.,They are being watchednby Roy Price and his team,,who record everything.,They record when somebody presses play,nwhen somebody presses pause,,what parts they skip,nwhat parts they watch again.,So they collect millions of data points,,because they wantnto have those data points,to then decidenwhich show they should make.,And sure enough,nso they collect all the data,,they do all the data crunching,nand an answer emerges,,and the answer is,,"Amazon should do a sitcomnabout four Republican US Senators.",They did that show. 
 So does anyone know the name of the show?,(Audience: "Alpha House."),Yes, "Alpha House,",but it seems like not too many of you herenremember that show, actually,,because it didn't turn out that great.,It's actually just an average show,,actually -- literally, in fact, becausenthe average of this curve here is at 7.4,,and "Alpha House" lands at 7.5,,so a slightly above average show,,but certainly not what Roy Pricenand his team were aiming for.,Meanwhile, however,nat about the same time,,at another company,,another executive did managento land a top show using data analysis,,and his name is Ted,,Ted Sarandos, who isnthe Chief Content Officer of Netflix,,and just like Roy,nhe's on a constant mission,to find that great TV show,,and he uses data as well to do that,,except he does itna little bit differently.,So instead of holding a competition,nwhat he did -- and his team of course --,was they looked at all the datanthey already had about Netflix viewers,,you know, the ratingsnthey give their shows,,the viewing histories,nwhat shows people like, and so on.,And then they use that data to discover,all of these little bits and piecesnabout the audience:,what kinds of shows they like,,what kind of producers,nwhat kind of actors.,And once they hadnall of these pieces together,,they took a leap of faith,,and they decided to license,not a sitcom about four Senators,but a drama series about a single Senator.,You guys know the show? 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflixnof course, nailed it with that show,,at least for the first two seasons. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 "House of Cards" getsna 9.1 rating on this curve,,so it's exactlynwhere they wanted it to be. 
 Now, the question of course is,nwhat happened here?,So you have two very competitive,ndata-savvy companies.,They connect all of thesenmillions of data points,,and then it worksnbeautifully for one of them,,and it doesn't work for the other one.,So why?,Because logic kind of tells younthat this should be working all the time.,I mean, if you're collectingnmillions of data points,on a decision you're going to make,,then you should be ablento make a pretty good decision.,You have 200 yearsnof statistics to rely on.,You're amplifying itnwith very powerful computers.,The least you could expectnis good TV, right? 
 And if data analysisndoes not work that way,,then it actually gets a little scary,,because we live in a timenwhere we're turning to data more and more,to make very serious decisionsnthat go far beyond TV.,Does anyone here know the companynMulti-Health Systems?,No one. OK, that's good actually.,OK, so Multi-Health Systemsnis a software company,,and I hope that nobody here in this room,ever comes into contactnwith that software,,because if you do,nit means you're in prison. 
 (Laughter) 
 If someone here in the US is in prison,nand they apply for parole,,then it's very likely thatndata analysis software from that company,will be used in determiningnwhether to grant that parole.,So it's the same principlenas Amazon and Netflix,,but now instead of deciding whetherna TV show is going to be good or bad,,you're deciding whether a personnis going to be good or bad.,And mediocre TV, 22 minutes,nthat can be pretty bad,,but more years in prison,nI guess, even worse. 
 And unfortunately, there is actuallynsome evidence that this data analysis,,despite having lots of data,ndoes not always produce optimum results.,And that's not because a companynlike Multi-Health Systems,doesn't know what to do with data.,Even the most data-savvyncompanies get it wrong.,Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes. 
 In 2009, Google announcednthat they were able, with data analysis,,to predict outbreaks of influenza,nthe nasty kind of flu,,by doing data analysisnon their Google searches.,And it worked beautifully,nand it made a big splash in the news,,including the pinnaclenof scientific success:,a publication in the journal "Nature.",It worked beautifullynfor year after year after year,,until one year it failed.,And nobody could even tell exactly why.,It just didn't work that year,,and of course that again made big news,,including now a retraction,of a publicationnfrom the journal "Nature.",So even the most data-savvy companies,nAmazon and Google,,they sometimes get it wrong.,And despite all those failures,,data is moving rapidlyninto real-life decision-making --,into the workplace,,law enforcement,,medicine.,So we should better make surenthat data is helping. 
 Now, personally I've seenna lot of this struggle with data myself,,because I work in computational genetics,,which is also a fieldnwhere lots of very smart people,are using unimaginable amounts of datanto make pretty serious decisions,like deciding on a cancer therapynor developing a drug.,And over the years,nI've noticed a sort of pattern,or kind of rule, if you will,nabout the difference,between successfulndecision-making with data,and unsuccessful decision-making,,and I find this a pattern worth sharing,nand it goes something like this. 
 So whenever you'rensolving a complex problem,,you're doing essentially two things.,The first one is, you take that problemnapart into its bits and pieces,so that you can deeply analyzenthose bits and pieces,,and then of coursenyou do the second part.,You put all of these bits and piecesnback together again,to come to your conclusion.,And sometimes younhave to do it over again,,but it's always those two things:,taking apart and puttingnback together again. 
 And now the crucial thing is,that data and data analysis,is only good for the first part.,Data and data analysis,nno matter how powerful,,can only help you taking a problem apartnand understanding its pieces.,It's not suited to put those piecesnback together again,and then to come to a conclusion.,There's another tool that can do that,nand we all have it,,and that tool is the brain.,If there's one thing a brain is good at,,it's taking bits and piecesnback together again,,even when you have incomplete information,,and coming to a good conclusion,,especially if it's the brain of an expert. 
 And that's why I believenthat Netflix was so successful,,because they used data and brainsnwhere they belong in the process.,They use data to first understandnlots of pieces about their audience,that they otherwise wouldn't havenbeen able to understand at that depth,,but then the decisionnto take all these bits and pieces,and put them back together againnand make a show like "House of Cards,",that was nowhere in the data.,Ted Sarandos and his teamnmade that decision to license that show,,which also meant, by the way,nthat they were taking,a pretty big personal risknwith that decision.,And Amazon, on the other hand,nthey did it the wrong way around.,They used data all the waynto drive their decision-making,,first when they heldntheir competition of TV ideas,,then when they selected "Alpha House"nto make as a show.,Which of course wasna very safe decision for them,,because they could alwaysnpoint at the data, saying,,"This is what the data tells us.",But it didn't lead to the exceptionalnresults that they were hoping for. 
 So data is of course a massivelynuseful tool to make better decisions,,but I believe that things go wrong,when data is startingnto drive those decisions.,No matter how powerful,ndata is just a tool,,and to keep that in mind,nI find this device here quite useful.,Many of you will ... 
 (Laughter) 
 Before there was data,,this was the decision-makingndevice to use. 
 (Laughter) 
 Many of you will know this.,This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball,,and it's really amazing,,because if you have a decision to make,na yes or no question,,all you have to do is you shake the ball,nand then you get an answer --,"Most Likely" -- right herenin this window in real time.,I'll have it out later for tech demos. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the thing is, of course --nso I've made some decisions in my life,where, in hindsight,nI should have just listened to the ball.,But, you know, of course,nif you have the data available,,you want to replace this with somethingnmuch more sophisticated,,like data analysisnto come to a better decision.,But that does not change the basic setup.,So the ball may get smarternand smarter and smarter,,but I believe it's still on usnto make the decisions,if we want to achievensomething extraordinary,,on the right end of the curve.,And I find that a very encouragingnmessage, in fact,,that even in the facenof huge amounts of data,,it still pays off to make decisions,,to be an expert in what you're doing,and take risks.,Because in the end, it's not data,,it's risks that will land younon the right end of the curve. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Here are two reasons companies fail:,they only do more of the same,,or they only do what's new. 
 To me the real, realnsolution to quality growth,is figuring out the balancenbetween two activities:,exploration and exploitation.,Both are necessary,,but it can be too much of a good thing. 
 Consider Facit.,I'm actually old enough to remember them.,Facit was a fantastic company.,They were born deep in the Swedish forest,,and they made the bestnmechanical calculators in the world.,Everybody used them.,And what did Facit do whennthe electronic calculator came along?,They continued doing exactly the same.,In six months, they wentnfrom maximum revenue ...,and they were gone.,Gone. 
 To me, the irony about the Facit story,is hearing about the Facit engineers,,who had bought cheap, smallnelectronic calculators in Japan,that they used to double-checkntheir calculators. 
 (Laughter) 
 Facit did too much exploitation.,But exploration can go wild, too. 
 A few years back,,I worked closely alongsidena European biotech company.,Let's call them OncoSearch.,The company was brilliant.,They had applications that promisednto diagnose, even cure,,certain forms of blood cancer.,Every day was aboutncreating something new.,They were extremely innovative,,and the mantra was,n"When we only get it right,",or even, "We want it perfect.",The sad thing is,,before they became perfect --,even good enough --,they became obsolete.,OncoSearch did too much exploration. 
 I first heard about explorationnand exploitation about 15 years ago,,when I worked as a visitingnscholar at Stanford University.,The founder of the idea is Jim March.,And to me the power of the ideanis its practicality. 
 Exploration.,Exploration is aboutncoming up with what's new.,It's about search,,it's about discovery,,it's about new products,,it's about new innovations.,It's about changing our frontiers.,Our heroes are peoplenwho have done exploration:,Madame Curie,,Picasso,,Neil Armstrong,,Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.,I come from Norway;,all our heroes are explorers,nand they deserve to be.,We all know that exploration is risky.,We don't know the answers,,we don't know if we're going to find them,,and we know that the risks are high. 
 Exploitation is the opposite.,Exploitation is takingnthe knowledge we have,and making good, better.,Exploitation is about makingnour trains run on time.,It's about making good productsnfaster and cheaper.,Exploitation is not risky --,in the short term.,But if we only exploit,,it's very risky in the long term.,And I think we all have memoriesnof the famous pop groups,who keep singing the same songsnagain and again,,until they become obsoletenor even pathetic.,That's the risk of exploitation. 
 So if we take a long-termnperspective, we explore.,If we take a short-termnperspective, we exploit.,Small children, they explore all day.,All day it's about exploration.,As we grow older,,we explore less because we havenmore knowledge to exploit on.,The same goes for companies.,Companies become,nby nature, less innovative,as they become more competent. 
 And this is, of course,na big worry to CEOs.,And I hear very often questionsnphrased in different ways.,For example,,"How can I both effectively runnand reinvent my company?",Or, "How can I make sure,that our company changesnbefore we become obsolete,or are hit by a crisis?",So, doing one well is difficult.,Doing both well as the same time is art --,pushing both exploration and exploitation. 
 So one thing we've found,is only about two percent of companiesnare able to effectively explore,and exploit at the same time, in parallel.,But when they do,,the payoffs are huge.,So we have lots of great examples.,We have Nestlé creating Nespresso,,we have Lego going into animated films,,Toyota creating the hybrids,,Unilever pushing into sustainability --,there are lots of examples,nand the benefits are huge. 
 Why is balancing so difficult?,I think it's difficultnbecause there are so many traps,that keep us where we are.,So I'll talk about two,nbut there are many. 
 So let's talk aboutnthe perpetual search trap.,We discover something,,but we don't have the patiencenor the persistence,to get at it and make it work.,So instead of staying with it,nwe create something new.,But the same goes for that,,then we're in the vicious circle,of actually coming up with ideasnbut being frustrated.,OncoSearch was a good example.,A famous example is, of course, Xerox.,But we don't only see this in companies.,We see this in the public sector as well.,We all know that any kindnof effective reform of education,,research, health care, even defense,,takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.,But still, we change much more often.,We really don't give them the chance. 
 Another trap is the success trap.,Facit fell into the success trap.,They literally heldnthe future in their hands,,but they couldn't see it.,They were simply so goodnat making what they loved doing,,that they wouldn't change.,We are like that, too.,When we know something well,nit's difficult to change.,Bill Gates has said:,"Success is a lousy teacher.,It seduces us into thinkingnwe cannot fail.",That's the challenge with success. 
 So I think there are some lessons,nand I think they apply to us.,And they apply to our companies.,The first lesson is:nget ahead of the crisis.,And any company that's able to innovate,is actually able to also buynan insurance in the future.,Netflix -- they could so easilynhave been content,with earlier generations of distribution,,but they always -- and I thinknthey will always --,keep pushing for the next battle.,I see other companies that say,,"I'll win the next innovation cycle,nwhatever it takes." 
 Second one: think in multiple time scales.,I'll share a chart with you,,and I think it's a wonderful one.,Any company we look at,,taking a one-year perspective,and looking at the valuationnof the company,,innovation typically accountsnfor only about 30 percent.,So when we think one year,,innovation isn't really that important.,Move ahead, take a 10-year perspectivenon the same company --,suddenly, innovation and abilitynto renew account for 70 percent.,But companies can't choose.,They need to fund the journeynand lead the long term. 
 Third:,invite talent.,I don't think it's possible for any of us,to be able to balance explorationnand exploitation by ourselves.,I think it's a team sport.,I think we need to allow challenging.,I think the mark of a great companynis being open to be challenged,,and the mark of a good corporate boardnis to constructively challenge.,I think that's also whatngood parenting is about. 
 Last one: be skeptical of success.,Maybe it's useful to think backnat the old triumph marches in Rome,,when the generals, after a big victory,,were given their celebration.,Riding into Rome on the carriage,,they always had a companionnwhispering in their ear,,"Remember, you're only human." 
 So I hope I made the point:,balancing exploration and exploitation,has a huge payoff.,But it's difficult,nand we need to be conscious. 
 I want to just point out two questionsnthat I think are useful.,First question is,nlooking at your own company:,In which areas do you seenthat the company is at the risk,of falling into success traps,,of just going on autopilot?,And what can you do to challenge? 
 Second question is:,When did I explore something new last,,and what kind of effect did it have on me?,Is that something I should do more of?,In my case, yes. 
 So let me leave you with this.,Whether you're an explorer by nature,or whether you tend to exploitnwhat you already know,,don't forget: the beautynis in the balance. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the year 1901,,a woman called Auguste was takennto a medical asylum in Frankfurt.,Auguste was delusional,and couldn't rememberneven the most basic details of her life.,Her doctor was called Alois.,Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,,but he watched over her until,nsadly, she passed away in 1906.,After she died, Alois performed an autopsy,and found strange plaquesnand tangles in Auguste's brain --,the likes of which he'd never seen before. 
 Now here's the even more striking thing.,If Auguste had instead been alive today,,we could offer her no more helpnthan Alois was able to 114 years ago.,Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.,And Auguste Deter,was the first patient to be diagnosed withnwhat we now call Alzheimer's disease.,Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.,We've discovered antibiotics and vaccinesnto protect us from infections,,many treatments for cancer,nantiretrovirals for HIV,,statins for heart disease and much more.,But we've made essentially no progressnat all in treating Alzheimer's disease. 
 I'm part of a team of scientists,who has been working to findna cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.,So I think about this all the time.,Alzheimer's now affectsn40 million people worldwide.,But by 2050, it will affectn150 million people --,which, by the way,nwill include many of you.,If you're hopingnto live to be 85 or older,,your chance of getting Alzheimer'snwill be almost one in two.,In other words, odds arenyou'll spend your golden years,either suffering from Alzheimer's,or helping to look after a friendnor loved one with Alzheimer's.,Already in the United States alone,,Alzheimer's care costsn200 billion dollars every year.,One out of every fivenMedicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.,It is today the most expensive disease,,and costs are projectednto increase fivefold by 2050,,as the baby boomer generation ages. 
 It may surprise you that, put simply,,Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medicalnand social challenges of our generation.,But we've done relativelynlittle to address it.,Today, of the top 10ncauses of death worldwide,,Alzheimer's is the only onenwe cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.,We understand less about the sciencenof Alzheimer's than other diseases,because we've invested less timenand money into researching it.,The US governmentnspends 10 times more every year,on cancer research than on Alzheimer's,despite the factnthat Alzheimer's costs us more,and causes a similar numbernof deaths each year as cancer. 
 The lack of resourcesnstems from a more fundamental cause:,a lack of awareness.,Because here's what few people knownbut everyone should:,Alzheimer's is a disease,nand we can cure it.,For most of the past 114 years,,everyone, including scientists, mistakenlynconfused Alzheimer's with aging.,We thought that becoming senile,was a normal and inevitablenpart of getting old.,But we only have to look at a picture,of a healthy aged brain comparednto the brain of an Alzheimer's patient,to see the real physical damagencaused by this disease.,As well as triggering severe lossnof memory and mental abilities,,the damage to the brainncaused by Alzheimer's,significantly reduces life expectancynand is always fatal. 
 Remember Dr. Alzheimernfound strange plaques and tangles,in Auguste's brain a century ago.,For almost a century,nwe didn't know much about these.,Today we know they're madenfrom protein molecules.,You can imagine a protein molecule,as a piece of paper that normally foldsninto an elaborate piece of origami.,There are spotsnon the paper that are sticky.,And when it folds correctly,nthese sticky bits end up on the inside.,But sometimes things go wrong,nand some sticky bits are on the outside.,This causes the protein moleculesnto stick to each other,,forming clumps that eventually becomenlarge plaques and tangles.,That's what we seenin the brains of Alzheimer's patients. 
 We've spent the past 10 yearsnat the University of Cambridge,trying to understandnhow this malfunction works.,There are many steps, and identifyingnwhich step to try to block is complex --,like defusing a bomb.,Cutting one wire might do nothing.,Cutting others mightnmake the bomb explore.,We have to find the right step to block,,and then create a drug that does it. 
 Until recently, we for the most part,have been cutting wiresnand hoping for the best.,But now we've got togetherna diverse group of people --,medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,nphysicists, engineers and mathematicians.,And together, we've managednto identify a critical step in the process,and are now testing a new class of drugsnwhich would specifically block this step,and stop the disease. 
 Now let me show younsome of our latest results.,No one outside of our labnhas seen these yet.,Let's look at some videos of what happenednwhen we tested these new drugs in worms.,So these are healthy worms,,and you can seenthey're moving around normally.,These worms, on the other hand,,have protein moleculesnsticking together inside them --,like humans with Alzheimer's.,And you can see they're clearly sick.,But if we give our new drugsnto these worms at an early stage,,then we see that they're healthy,nand they live a normal lifespan.,This is just an initial positive result,nbut research like this,shows us that Alzheimer's is a diseasenthat we can understand and we can cure. 
 After 114 years of waiting,,there's finally real hopenfor what can be achieved,in the next 10 or 20 years.,But to grow that hope,nto finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.,This isn't about scientists like me --,it's about you.,We need you to raise awarenessnthat Alzheimer's is a disease,and that if we try, we can beat it.,In the case of other diseases,,patients and their familiesnhave led the charge for more research,and put pressure on governments,nthe pharmaceutical industry,,scientists and regulators.,That was essential for advancing treatmentnfor HIV in the late 1980s.,Today, we see that same drivento beat cancer.,But Alzheimer's patients are oftennunable to speak up for themselves.,And their families, the hidden victims,ncaring for their loved ones night and day,,are often too worn outnto go out and advocate for change.,So, it really is down to you.,Alzheimer's isn't,nfor the most part, a genetic disease.,Everyone with a brain is at risk.,Today, there are 40 millionnpatients like Auguste,,who can't create the changenthey need for themselves.,Help speak up for them,,and help demand a cure. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?,There's still some confusionnabout that question,,as this is a fairly new field of research.,For example, I was talkingnto one of my colleagues, Robert,,who is an oncologist,,and he was telling me,,"Sandrine, this is puzzling.,Some of my patients that have been toldnthey are cured of their cancer,still develop symptoms of depression.",And I responded to him,,"Well, from my point of viewnthat makes sense.,The drug you give to your patientsnthat stops the cancer cells multiplying,also stops the newborn neuronsnbeing generated in their brain.",And then Robert looked at menlike I was crazy and said,,"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --,adults do not grow new nerve cells.",And much to his surprise, I said,n"Well actually, we do.",And this is a phenomenonnthat we call neurogenesis. 
 [Neurogenesis] 
 Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,,and when he went to medical schoolnhe was not taught what we know now --,that the adult brainncan generate new nerve cells.,So Robert, you know,nbeing the good doctor that he is,,wanted to come to my lab,to understand the topicna little bit better.,And I took him for a tour,of one of the most excitingnparts of the brain,when it comes to neurogenesis --,and this is the hippocampus.,So this is this gray structurenin the center of the brain.,And what we've known alreadynfor very long,,is that this is important for learning,nmemory, mood and emotion.,However, what wenhave learned more recently,is that this is one of the uniquenstructures of the adult brain,where new neurons can be generated.,And if we slice through the hippocampus,and zoom in,,what you actually see here in blue,is a newborn neuronnin an adult mouse brain.,So when it comes to the human brain --,my colleague Jonas Frisénnfrom the Karolinska Institutet,,has estimated that we producen700 new neurons per day,in the hippocampus.,You might think this is not much,,compared to the billionsnof neurons we have.,But by the time we turn 50,,we will have all exchanged the neuronsnwe were born with in that structure,with adult-born neurons. 
 So why are these new neurons importantnand what are their functions?,First, we know that they're importantnfor learning and memory.,And in the lab we have shown,that if we block the abilitynof the adult brain,to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,,then we block certain memory abilities.,And this is especially new and truenfor spatial recognition --,so like, how you navigatenyour way in the city. 
 We are still learning a lot,,and neurons are not only importantnfor memory capacity,,but also for the quality of the memory.,And they will have been helpfulnto add time to our memory,and they will help differentiatenvery similar memories, like:,how do you find your bike,that you park at the stationnevery day in the same area,,but in a slightly different position? 
 And more interestingnto my colleague Robert,is the research we have been doingnon neurogenesis and depression.,So in an animal model of depression,,we have seen that we havena lower level of neurogenesis.,And if we give antidepressants,,then we increase the productionnof these newborn neurons,,and we decreasenthe symptoms of depression,,establishing a clear linknbetween neurogenesis and depression.,But moreover, if younjust block neurogenesis,,then you block the efficacynof the antidepressant.,So by then, Robert had understood,that very likely his patientsnwere suffering from depression,even after being cured of their cancer,,because the cancer drug had stoppednnewborn neurons from being generated.,And it will take timento generate new neurons,that reach normal functions. 
 So, collectively, now we thinknwe have enough evidence,to say that neurogenesisnis a target of choice,if we want to improvenmemory formation or mood,,or even prevent the declinenassociated with aging,,or associated with stress. 
 So the next question is:,can we control neurogenesis?,The answer is yes.,And we are now going to do a little quiz.,I'm going to give you a setnof behaviors and activities,,and you tell me if you thinknthey will increase neurogenesis,or if they will decrease neurogenesis.,Are we ready?,OK, let's go. 
 So what about learning?,Increasing?,Yes.,Learning will increase the productionnof these new neurons. 
 How about stress?,Yes, stress will decrease the productionnof new neurons in the hippocampus. 
 How about sleep deprivation?,Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis. 
 How about sex?,Oh, wow! 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, you are right, it will increasenthe production of new neurons.,However, it's all about balance here.,We don't want to fall in a situation -- 
 (Laughter) 
 about too much sexnleading to sleep deprivation. 
 (Laughter) 
 How about getting older?,So the neurogenesis ratenwill decrease as we get older,,but it is still occurring. 
 And then finally, how about running?,I will let you judge that one by yourself. 
 So this is one of the first studies,that was carried out by one of my mentors,nRusty Gage from the Salk Institute,,showing that the environmentncan have an impact,on the production of new neurons.,And here you see a sectionnof the hippocampus of a mouse,that had no running wheel in its cage.,And the little black dots you seenare actually newborn neurons-to-be.,And now, you see a sectionnof the hippocampus of a mouse,that had a running wheel in its cage.,So you see the massive increase,of the black dots representingnthe new neurons-to-be. 
 So activity impacts neurogenesis,nbut that's not all.,What you eat will have an effect,on the production of new neuronsnin the hippocampus.,So here we have a sample of diet --,of nutrients that have been shownnto have efficacy.,And I'm just goingnto point a few out to you:,Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percentnwill increase neurogenesis.,Intermittent fasting --nspacing the time between your meals --,will increase neurogenesis.,Intake of flavonoids,,which are containednin dark chocolate or blueberries,,will increase neurogenesis.,Omega-3 fatty acids,,present in fatty fish, like salmon,,will increase the productionnof these new neurons.,Conversely, a diet richnin high saturated fat,will have a negative impactnon neurogenesis.,Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --nwill decrease neurogenesis.,However, not everything is lost;,resveratrol, which isncontained in red wine,,has been shown to promotenthe survival of these new neurons.,So next time you are at a dinner party,,you might want to reach for this possiblyn"neurogenesis-neutral" drink. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then finally,nlet me point out the last one --,a quirky one.,So Japanese groups are fascinatednwith food textures,,and they have shown that actuallynsoft diet impairs neurogenesis,,as opposed to food that requiresnmastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food. 
 So all of this data,,where we need to looknat the cellular level,,has been generated using animal models.,But this diet has also been givennto human participants,,and what we could see is thatnthe diet modulates memory and mood,in the same directionnas it modulates neurogenesis,,such as: calorie restrictionnwill improve memory capacity,,whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbatensymptoms of depression --,as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,nwhich increase neurogenesis,,and also help to decreasenthe symptoms of depression.,So we think that the effect of diet,on mental health, on memory and mood,,is actually mediated by the productionnof the new neurons in the hippocampus.,And it's not only what you eat,,but it's also the texturenof the food, when you eat it,and how much of it you eat. 
 On our side -- neuroscientistsninterested in neurogenesis --,we need to understand betternthe function of these new neurons,,and how we can control their survivalnand their production.,We also need to find a way to protectnthe neurogenesis of Robert's patients.,And on your side --,I leave you in chargenof your neurogenesis. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Margaret Heffernan:nFantastic research, Sandrine.,Now, I told you you changed my life --,I now eat a lot of blueberries. 
 Sandrine Thuret: Very good. 
 MH: I'm really interestednin the running thing.,Do I have to run?,Or is it really justnabout aerobic exercise,,getting oxygen to the brain?,Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise? 
 ST: So for the moment,,we can't really saynif it's just the running itself,,but we think that anything that indeednwill increase the production --,or moving the blood flow to the brain,,should be beneficial. 
 MH: So I don't have to getna running wheel in my office? 
 ST: No, you don't! 
 MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.,Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much. 
 ST: Thank you, Margaret. 
 (Applause)Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prizen[winner] in economics, once wrote:,"Productivity is not everything,nbut in the long run,,it is almost everything." 
 So this is serious.,There are not that many things on earthnthat are "almost everything.",Productivity is the principal drivernof the prosperity of a society.,So we have a problem.,In the largest European economies,,productivity used to grownfive percent per annum,in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.,From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.,From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.,Since 1995: less thannone percent per annum.,The same profile in Japan.,The same profile in the US,,despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,,and despite allnthe technological innovations,around us: the Internet, the information,,the new informationnand communication technologies. 
 When productivity growsnthree percent per annum,,you double the standard of livingnevery generation.,Every generation is twicenas well-off as its parents'.,When it grows one percent per annum,,it takes three generationsnto double the standard of living.,And in this process, many peoplenwill be less well-off than their parents.,They will have less of everything:,smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,,less access to education, to vitamins,nto antibiotics, to vaccination --,to everything.,Think of all the problemsnthat we're facing at the moment.,All.,Chances are that they are rootednin the productivity crisis. 
 Why this crisis?,Because the basic tenetsnabout efficiency --,effectiveness in organizations,nin management --,have become counterproductivenfor human efforts.,Everywhere in public services --nin companies, in the way we work,,the way we innovate, invest --ntry to learn to work better.,Take the holy trinity of efficiency:,clarity, measurement, accountability.,They make human efforts derail. 
 There are two waysnto look at it, to prove it.,One, the one I prefer,,is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.,But the full math versionntakes a little while,,so there is another one.,It is to look at a relay race.,This is what we will do today.,It's a bit more animated, more visualnand also faster -- it's a race.,Hopefully, it's faster. 
 (Laughter) 
 World championship final -- women.,Eight teams in the final.,The fastest team is the US team.,They have the fastest women on earth.,They are the favorite team to win.,Notably, if you compare themnto an average team,,say, the French team, 
 (Laughter) 
 based on their best performancesnin the 100-meter race,,if you add the individual timesnof the US runners,,they arrive at the finish linen3.2 meters ahead of the French team.,And this year, the US teamnis in great shape.,Based on their best performance this year,,they arrive 6.4 metersnahead of the French team,,based on the data.,We are going to look at the race.,At some point you will see,ntowards the end,,that Torri Edwards,nthe fourth US runner, is ahead.,Not surprising -- this year she gotnthe gold medal in the 100-meter race.,And by the way, Chryste Gaines,nthe second runner in the US team,,is the fastest woman on earth.,So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.,Where are the two fastest? On the US team.,And the two other runnersnon the US team are not bad, either. 
 (Laughter) 
 So clearly, the US team has wonnthe war for talent.,But behind, the average teamnis trying to catch up.,Let's watch the race. 
 (Video: French sportscasters narrate race) 
 (Video: Race narration ends) 
 Yves Morieux: So what happened?,The fastest team did not win;nthe slower one did.,By the way, I hope you appreciate,the deep historical research I didnto make the French look good. 
 (Laughter) 
 But let's not exaggerate --nit's not archeology, either. 
 (Laughter) 
 But why?,Because of cooperation.,When you hear this sentence:,"Thanks to cooperation, the wholenis worth more than the sum of the parts.",This is not poetry;nthis is not philosophy.,This is math.,Those who carry the baton are slower,,but their baton is faster.,Miracle of cooperation:,it multiplies energy,nintelligence in human efforts.,It is the essence of human efforts:,how we work together, how each effortncontributes to the efforts of others.,With cooperation,nwe can do more with less. 
 Now, what happens to cooperationnwhen the holy grail --,the holy trinity, even --,of clarity, measurement, accountability --,appears? 
 Clarity.,Management reports are full of complaintsnabout the lack of clarity.,Compliance audits,nconsultants' diagnostics.,We need more clarity, we neednto clarify the roles, the processes.,It is as though the runnersnon the team were saying,,"Let's be clear -- where does my rolenreally start and end?,Am I supposed to run for 95 meters,n96, 97...?",It's important, let's be clear.,If you say 97, after 97 meters,,people will drop the baton, whethernthere is someone to take it or not. 
 Accountability.,We are constantly tryingnto put accountability,in someone's hands.,Who is accountable for this process?,We need somebody accountablenfor this process.,So in the relay race,nsince passing the baton is so important,,then we need somebodynclearly accountable for passing the baton.,So between each runner,,now we will have a new dedicated athlete,,clearly dedicated to takingnthe baton from one runner,,and passing it to the next runner.,And we will have at least two like that.,Well, will we, in that case, win the race?,That I don't know, but for sure,,we would have a clear interface,,a clear line of accountability.,We will know who to blame.,But we'll never win the race.,If you think about it,nwe pay more attention,to knowing who to blame in case we fail,,than to creatingnthe conditions to succeed.,All the human intelligencenput in organization design --,urban structures, processing systems --,what is the real goal?,To have somebody guilty in case they fail.,We are creatingnorganizations able to fail,,but in a compliant way,,with somebody clearlynaccountable when we fail.,And we are quite effectivenat that -- failing. 
 Measurement.,What gets measured gets done.,Look, to pass the baton,nyou have to do it at the right time,,in the right hand, at the right speed.,But to do that, you have to putnenergy in your arm.,This energy that is in your armnwill not be in your legs.,It will come at the expensenof your measurable speed.,You have to shout early enoughnto the next runner,when you will pass the baton,nto signal that you are arriving,,so that the next runnerncan prepare, can anticipate.,And you have to shout loud.,But the blood, the energynthat will be in your throat,will not be in your legs.,Because you know, there areneight people shouting at the same time.,So you have to recognize the voicenof your colleague.,You cannot say, "Is it you?",Too late! 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, let's look at the racenin slow motion,,and concentrate on the third runner.,Look at where she allocates her efforts,,her energy, her attention.,Not all in her legs -- that wouldnbe great for her own speed --,but in also in her throat,narm, eye, brain.,That makes a difference in whose legs?,In the legs of the next runner.,But when the next runner runs super-fast,,is it because she made a super effort,,or because of the waynthe third runner passed the baton?,There is no metric on earthnthat will give us the answer.,And if we reward people on the basisnof their measurable performance,,they will put their energy,ntheir attention, their blood,in what can get measured -- in their legs.,And the baton will fall and slow down. 
 To cooperate is not a super effort,,it is how you allocate your effort.,It is to take a risk,,because you sacrificenthe ultimate protection,granted by objectively measurablenindividual performance.,It is to make a super differencenin the performance of others,,with whom we are compared.,It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.,And people are not stupid;nthey don't cooperate. 
 You know, clarity, accountability,nmeasurement were OK,when the world was simpler.,But business has become much more complex.,With my teams, we have measured,the evolution of complexity in business.,It is much more demanding todaynto attract and retain customers,,to build advantage on a global scale,,to create value.,And the more business gets complex,,the more, in the name of clarity,naccountability, measurement,we multiply structures,nprocesses, systems. 
 You know, this drive for claritynand accountability triggers,a counterproductive multiplicationnof interfaces, middle offices,,coordinators that do not onlynmobilize people and resources,,but that also add obstacles.,And the more complicated the organization,,the more difficult it is to understandnwhat is really happening.,So we need summaries, proxies, reports,,key performance indicators, metrics.,So people put their energynin what can get measured,,at the expense of cooperation.,And as performance deteriorates,,we add even more structure,nprocess, systems.,People spend their time in meetings,,writing reports they havento do, undo and redo.,Based on our analysis,nteams in these organizations,spend between 40 and 80 percentnof their time wasting their time,,but working harder and harder,nlonger and longer,,on less and less value-adding activities.,This is what is killing productivity,,what makes people suffer at work. 
 Our organizations are wastingnhuman intelligence.,They have turned against human efforts.,When people don't cooperate,,don't blame their mindsets,ntheir mentalities, their personality --,look at the work situations.,Is it really in their personal interestnto cooperate or not,,if, when they cooperate,nthey are individually worse off?,Why would they cooperate?,When we blame personalities,instead of the clarity,nthe accountability, the measurement,,we add injustice to ineffectiveness. 
 We need to create organizations,in which it becomes individually usefulnfor people to cooperate.,Remove the interfaces,nthe middle offices --,all these complicatedncoordination structures.,Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.,Fuzziness overlaps.,Remove most of the quantitative metricsnto assess performance.,Speed the "what.",Look at cooperation, the "how.",How did you pass the baton?,Did you throw it,nor did you pass it effectively?,Am I putting my energynin what can get measured --,my legs, my speed --nor in passing the baton? 
 You, as leaders, as managers,,are you making it individually usefulnfor people to cooperate?,The future of our organizations,,our companies, our societies,hinges on your answer to these questions. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I published this article,in the New York Times Modern Love columnnin January of this year.,"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This.",And the articlenis about a psychological study,designed to create romantic lovenin the laboratory,,and my own experiencentrying the study myself,one night last summer. 
 So the procedure is fairly simple:,two strangers take turns asking each othern36 increasingly personal questions,and then they stare into each other's eyes,without speaking for four minutes. 
 So here are a couple of sample questions. 
 Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrownhaving gained any one quality or ability,,what would it be? 
 Number 28: When did you last crynin front of another person?,By yourself? 
 As you can see, they really donget more personal as they go along. 
 Number 30, I really like this one:,Tell your partnernwhat you like about them;,be very honest this time,,saying things you might not saynto someone you just met. 
 So when I first came across this studyna few years earlier,,one detail really stuck out to me,,and that was the rumornthat two of the participants,had gotten married six months later,,and they'd invited the entire labnto the ceremony.,So I was of course very skeptical,about this process of justnmanufacturing romantic love,,but of course I was intrigued.,And when I got the chancento try this study myself,,with someone I knewnbut not particularly well,,I wasn't expecting to fall in love.,But then we did, and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And I thought it made a good story,nso I sent it to the Modern Love column,a few months later. 
 Now, this was published in January,,and now it is August,,so I'm guessing that some of younare probably wondering,,are we still together?,And the reason I thinknyou might be wondering this,is because I have been asked this question,again and again and againnfor the past seven months.,And this question is reallynwhat I want to talk about today.,But let's come back to it. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the week before the article came out,,I was very nervous.,I had been workingnon a book about love stories,for the past few years,,so I had gotten used to writingnabout my own experiences,with romantic love on my blog.,But a blog post might getna couple hundred views at the most,,and those were usuallynjust my Facebook friends,,and I figured my articlenin the New York Times,would probably get a few thousand views.,And that felt like a lot of attention,on a relatively new relationship.,But as it turned out, I had no idea. 
 So the article was published online,on a Friday evening,,and by Saturday, this had happenednto the traffic on my blog.,And by Sunday, both the Today Shownand Good Morning America had called.,Within a month, the articlenwould receive over 8 million views,,and I was, to say the least,,underprepared for this sort of attention.,It's one thing to work upnthe confidence to write honestly,about your experiences with love,,but it is another thing to discover,that your love lifenhas made international news -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and to realizenthat people across the world,are genuinely investednin the status of your new relationship. 
 (Laughter) 
 And when people called or emailed,nwhich they did every day for weeks,,they always asked the same question first:,are you guys still together?,In fact, as I was preparing this talk,,I did a quick search of my email inbox,for the phrase "Are you still together?",and several messagesnpopped up immediately.,They were from students and journalists,and friendly strangers like this one.,I did radio interviews and they asked.,I even gave a talk, and one womannshouted up to the stage,,"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?",And I promptly turned bright red. 
 I understand that thisnis part of the deal.,If you write about your relationshipnin an international newspaper,,you should expect peoplento feel comfortable asking about it.,But I just wasn't preparednfor the scope of the response.,The 36 questions seemnto have taken on a life of their own.,In fact, the New York Timesnpublished a follow-up article,for Valentine's Day,,which featured readers' experiencesnof trying the study themselves,,with varying degrees of success. 
 So my first impulsenin the face of all of this attention,was to become very protectivenof my own relationship.,I said no to every requestnfor the two of us,to do a media appearance together.,I turned down TV interviews,,and I said no to every requestnfor photos of the two us.,I think I was afraid that we would become,inadvertent iconsnfor the process of falling in love,,a position I did not at allnfeel qualified for. 
 And I get it:,people didn't just want to knownif the study worked,,they wanted to know if it really worked:,that is, if it was capablenof producing love that would last,,not just a fling, but real love,nsustainable love. 
 But this was a questionnI didn't feel capable of answering.,My own relationshipnwas only a few months old,,and I felt like people were askingnthe wrong question in the first place.,What would knowing whether or notnwe were still together really tell them?,If the answer was no,,would it make the experiencenof doing these 36 questions,any less worthwhile?,Dr. Arthur Aron first wrotenabout these questions,in this study here in 1997,,and here, the researcher's goalnwas not to produce romantic love.,Instead, they wanted to foster,interpersonal closenessnamong college students,,by using what Aron called,"sustained, escalating, reciprocal,npersonalistic self-disclosure.",Sounds romantic, doesn't it?,But the study did work.,The participantsndid feel closer after doing it,,and several subsequent studies have alsonused Aron's fast friends protocol,as a way to quickly createntrust and intimacy between strangers.,They've used it between membersnof the police and members of community,,and they've used it between peoplenof opposing political ideologies.,The original version of the story,,the one that I tried last summer,,that pairs the personal questionsnwith four minutes of eye contact,,was referenced in this article,,but unfortunately it was never published. 
 So a few months ago, I was giving a talk,at a small liberal arts college,,and a student came up to me afterwards,and he said, kind of shyly,,"So, I tried your study,nand it didn't work.",He seemed a little mystified by this.,"You mean, you didn't fall in lovenwith the person you did it with?" I asked. 
 "Well..." He paused.,"I think she just wants to be friends." 
 "But did you becomenbetter friends?" I asked.,"Did you feel like you got to reallynknow each other after doing the study?",He nodded. 
 "So, then it worked," I said. 
 I don't think this is the answernhe was looking for.,In fact, I don't think this is the answernthat any of us are looking for,when it comes to love. 
 I first came across this study,when I was 29,and I was going throughna really difficult breakup.,I had been in the relationshipnsince I was 20,,which was basically my entire adult life,,and he was my first real love,,and I had no idea how or ifnI could make a life without him.,So I turned to science.,I researched everything I could findnabout the science of romantic love,,and I think I was hoping that it mightnsomehow inoculate me from heartache.,I don't know if I realizednthis at the time --,I thought I was just doing researchnfor this book I was writing --,but it seems really obvious in retrospect.,I hoped that if I armed myselfnwith the knowledge of romantic love,,I might never have to feelnas terrible and lonely as I did then.,And all this knowledgenhas been useful in some ways.,I am more patient with love.nI am more relaxed.,I am more confidentnabout asking for what I want.,But I can also see myself more clearly,,and I can see that what I wantnis sometimes more,than can reasonably be asked for.,What I want from love is a guarantee,,not just that I am loved today,and that I will be loved tomorrow,,but that I will continue to be lovednby the person I love indefinitely.,Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee,that people were really asking about,when they wanted to knownif we were still together. 
 So the story that the media toldnabout the 36 questions,was that there might bena shortcut to falling in love.,There might be a way to somehownmitigate some of the risk involved,,and this is a very appealing story,,because falling in love feels amazing,,but it's also terrifying.,The moment you admit to loving someone,,you admit to having a lot to lose,,and it's true that these questionsndo provide a mechanism,for getting to know someone quickly,,which is also a mechanism for being known,,and I think this is the thingnthat most of us really want from love:,to be known, to be seen, to be understood.,But I think when it comes to love,,we are too willing to acceptnthe short version of the story.,The version of the story that asks,n"Are you still together?",and is content with a yes or no answer. 
 So rather than that question,,I would propose we asknsome more difficult questions,,questions like:,How do you decide who deserves your love,and who does not?,How do you stay in lovenwhen things get difficult,,and how do you knownwhen to just cut and run?,How do you live with the doubt,that inevitably creepsninto every relationship,,or even harder,,how do you live with your partner's doubt?,I don't necessarily knownthe answers to these questions,,but I think they're an important startnat having a more thoughtful conversation,about what it means to love someone. 
 So, if you want it,,the short version of the storynof my relationship is this:,a year ago, an acquaintancenand I did a study,designed to create romantic love,,and we fell in love,,and we are still together,,and I am so glad. 
 But falling in love is notnthe same thing as staying in love.,Falling in love is the easy part.,So at the end of my article, I wrote,n"Love didn't happen to us.,We're in love because we eachnmade the choice to be.",And I cringe a littlenwhen I read that now,,not because it isn't true,,but because at the time,nI really hadn't considered,everything that was containednin that choice.,I didn't consider how many timesnwe would each have to make that choice,,and how many times I will continuento have to make that choice,without knowing whether or notnhe will always choose me.,I want it to be enough to have askednand answered 36 questions,,and to have chosen to love someonenso generous and kind and fun,and to have broadcast that choicenin the biggest newspaper in America.,But what I have done insteadnis turn my relationship,into the kind of mythnI don't quite believe in.,And what I want, what perhapsnI will spend my life wanting,,is for that myth to be true. 
 I want the happy endingnimplied by the title to my article,,which is, incidentally,,the only part of the articlenthat I didn't actually write. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what I have instead is the chancento make the choice to love someone,,and the hope that he will choosento love me back,,and it is terrifying,,but that's the deal with love. 
 Thank you.When I was a kid,nmy parents would tell me,,"You can make a mess,nbut you have to clean up after yourself.",So freedom came with responsibility.,But my imagination would take mento all these wonderful places,,where everything was possible.,So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --,or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,,because adults would lie to usnto protect us from the ugly truth.,And growing up, I found outnthat adults make a mess,,and they're not very goodnat cleaning up after themselves. 
 Fast forward, I am an adult now,,and I teach citizen science and inventionnat the Hong Kong Harbour School.,And it doesn't take too long,before my students walk on a beachnand stumble upon piles of trash.,So as good citizens,nwe clean up the beaches --,and no, he is not drinking alcohol,nand if he is, I did not give it to him. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so it's sad to say,,but today more than 80 percent nof the oceans have plastic in them.,It's a horrifying fact.,And in past decades,,we've been taking those big ships outnand those big nets,,and we collect those plastic bitsnthat we look at under a microscope,,and we sort them,,and then we put this data onto a map.,But that takes forever,nit's very expensive,,and so it's quite riskynto take those big boats out. 
 So with my students, ages six to 15,,we've been dreamingnof inventing a better way.,So we've transformed our tinynHong Kong classroom into a workshop.,And so we started buildingnthis small workbench,,with different heights,nso even really short kids can participate.,And let me tell you, kids with power toolsnare awesome and safe. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not really.,And so, back to plastic.,We collect this plastic and we grind itnto the size we find it in the ocean,,which is very smallnbecause it breaks down.,And so this is how we work.,I let the imaginationsnof my students run wild.,And my job is to try to collectnthe best of each kid's idea,and try to combine it into somethingnthat hopefully would work.,And so we have agreednthat instead of collecting plastic bits,,we are going to collect only the data.,So we're going to get an imagenof the plastic with a robot --,so robots, kids get very excited.,And the next thing we do --nwe do what we call "rapid prototyping.",We are so rapid at prototyping,that the lunch is still in the lunchboxnwhen we're hacking it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we hack table lamps and webcams,ninto plumbing fixtures,and we assemble that into a floating robotnthat will be slowly moving through water,and through the plasticnthat we have there --,and this is the imagenthat we get in the robot.,So we see the plastic piecesnfloating slowly through the sensor,,and the computer on boardnwill process this image,,and measure the size of each particle,,so we have a rough estimatenof how much plastic there is in the water. 
 So we documentednthis invention step by step,on a website for inventorsncalled Instructables,,in the hope that somebodynwould make it even better. 
 What was really cool about this projectnwas that the students saw a local problem,,and boom -- they are tryingnto immediately address it. 
 [I can investigate my local problem] 
 But my students in Hong Kongnare hyperconnected kids.,And they watch the news,nthey watch the Internet,,and they came across this image.,This was a child, probably under 10,ncleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,,in the Sundarbans, which is the world'snlargest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.,So they were very shocked,,because this is the water they drink,nthis is the water they bathe in,,this is the water they fish in --nthis is the place where they live.,And also you can see the water is brown,nthe mud is brown and oil is brown,,so when everything is mixed up,,it's really hard to seenwhat's in the water.,But, there's a technologynthat's rather simple,,that's called spectrometry,,that allows you see what's in the water.,So we built a rough prototypenof a spectrometer,,and you can shine lightnthrough different substances,that produce different spectrums,,so that can help younidentify what's in the water.,So we packed this prototype of a sensor,,and we shipped it to Bangladesh.,So what was cool about this project,was that beyond addressingna local problem,,or looking at a local problem,,my students used their empathynand their sense of being creative,to help, remotely, other kids. 
 [I can investigate a remote problem] 
 So I was very compellednby doing the second experiments,,and I wanted to take it even further --,maybe addressing an even harder problem,nand it's also closer to my heart. 
 So I'm half Japanese and half French,,and maybe you remember in 2011nthere was a massive earthquake in Japan.,It was so violent that it triggerednseveral giant waves --,they are called tsunami --,and those tsunami destroyed many citiesnon the eastern coast of Japan.,More than 14,000 peoplendied in an instant.,Also, it damaged the nuclearnpower plant of Fukushima,,the nuclear power plant just by the water.,And today, I read the reports,and an average of 300 tons,are leaking from the nuclear power plantninto the Pacific Ocean.,And today the whole Pacific Oceannhas traces of contamination of cesium-137.,If you go outside on the West Coast,nyou can measure Fukushima everywhere.,But if you look at the map,nit can look like most of the radioactivity,has been washed awaynfrom the Japanese coast,,and most of it is now --nit looks like it's safe, it's blue.,Well, reality is a bitnmore complicated than this. 
 So I've been going to Fukushimanevery year since the accident,,and I measure independentlynand with other scientists,,on land, in the river --,and this time we wanted to take the kids.,So of course we didn't take the kids,nthe parents wouldn't allow that to happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 But every night we would reportnto "Mission Control" --,different masks they're wearing.,It could look like they didn't takenthe work seriously, but they really did,because they're going to have to livenwith radioactivity their whole life.,And so what we did with them,is that we'd discuss the datanwe collected that day,,and talk about wherenwe should be going next --,strategy, itinerary, etc...,And to do this, we builtna very rough topographical map,of the region aroundnthe nuclear power plant.,And so we built the elevation map,,we sprinkled pigments to representnreal-time data for radioactivity,,and we sprayed waternto simulate the rainfall.,And with this we could seenthat the radioactive dust,was washing from the top of the mountainninto the river system,,and leaking into the ocean.,So it was a rough estimate. 
 But with this in mind,nwe organized this expedition,,which was the closest civilians have beennto the nuclear power plant.,We are sailing 1.5 kilometers awaynfrom the nuclear power plant,,and with the help of the local fisherman,,we are collecting sediment from the seabed,with a custom sediment samplernwe've invented and built.,We pack the sediment into small bags,,we then dispatch themnto hundreds of small bags,that we send to different universities,,and we produce the mapnof the seabed radioactivity,,especially in estuariesnwhere the fish will reproduce,,and I will hope that we will have improved,the safety of the local fishermennand of your favorite sushi. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see a progression here --,we've gone from a local problemnto a remote problem to a global problem.,And it's been super excitingnto work at these different scales,,with also very simple,nopen-source technologies.,But at the same time,nit's been increasingly frustrating,because we have only started to measurenthe damage that we have done.,We haven't even startednto try to solve the problems.,And so I wondernif we should just take a leap,and try to invent better waysnto do all these things. 
 And so the classroomnstarted to feel a little bit small,,so we found an industrialnsite in Hong Kong,,and we turned it intonthe largest mega-space,focused on socialnand environmental impact.,It's in central Hong Kong,,and it's a place we can worknwith wood, metal, chemistry,,a bit of biology, a bit of optics,,basically you can buildnpretty much everything there.,And its a place wherenadults and kids can play together.,It's a place wherenkids' dreams can come true,,with the help of adults,,and where adults can be kids again. 
 Student: Acceleration! Acceleration! 
 Cesar Harada: We're askingnquestions such as,,can we invent the future of mobilitynwith renewable energy?,For example.,Or, can we help the mobilitynof the aging population,by transforming very standard wheelchairsninto cool, electric vehicles? 
 So plastic, oil and radioactivitynare horrible, horrible legacies,,but the very worst legacynthat we can leave our children is lies.,We can no longer affordnto shield the kids from the ugly truth,because we need their imaginationnto invent the solutions. 
 So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --,we must prepare the next generation,that cares aboutnthe environment and people,,and that can actuallyndo something about it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Religion is more than belief.,It's power, and it's influence.,And that influence affects all of us,,every day, regardless of your own belief.,Despite the enormous influencenof religion on the world today,,we hold them to a different standardnof scrutiny and accountability,than any other sector of our society.,For example, if there werena multinational organization,,government or corporation today,that said no femalencould be on a leadership board,,not one woman could havena decision-making authority,,not one woman could handlenany financial matter,,we would have outrage.,There would be sanctions.,And yet this is a common practicenin almost every world religion today. 
 We accept things in our religious lives,that we do not acceptnin our secular lives,,and I know this because I've beenndoing it for three decades.,I was the type of girl that fought everynform of gender discrimination growing up.,I played pickup basketball gamesnwith the boys and inserted myself.,I said I was going to be the firstnfemale President of the United States.,I have been fightingnfor the Equal Rights Amendment,,which has been dead for 40 years.,I'm the first womannin both sides of my family,to ever work outside the homenand ever receive a higher education. 
 I never accepted being excludednbecause I was a woman,,except in my religion.,Throughout all of that time,,I was a part of a very patriarchalnorthodox Mormon religion.,I grew up in an enormouslyntraditional family.,I have eight siblings,na stay-at-home mother.,My father's actuallyna religious leader in the community.,And I grew up in a world believingnthat my worth and my standing,was in keeping these rulesnthat I'd known my whole life.,You get married a virgin,nyou never drink alcohol,,you don't smoke, you always do service,,you're a good kid.,Some of the rules we had were strict,,but you followed the rulesnbecause you loved the people,and you loved the religionnand you believed. 
 Everything about Mormonismndetermined what you wore,,who you dated, who you married.,It determined what underwear we wore.,I was the kind of religiousnwhere everyone I know,donated 10 percent of everythingnthey earned to the church,,including myself.,From paper routes and babysitting,nI donated 10 percent.,I was the kind of religiousnwhere I heard parents tell children,when they're leavingnon a two-year proselytizing mission,that they would rather have them die,than return homenwithout honor, having sinned.,I was the type and the kind of religious,where kids kill themselvesnevery single year,because they're terrifiednof coming out to our community as gay.,But I was also the kind of religious,where it didn't matternwhere in the world I lived,,I had friendship,ninstantaneous mutual aid.,This was where I felt safe.nThis is certainty and clarity about life.,I had help raising my little daughter.,So that's why I accepted without questionnthat only men can lead,,and I accepted without question,that women can't have the spiritualnauthority of God on the Earth,,which we call the priesthood.,And I allowed discrepancies betweennmen and women in operating budgets,,disciplinary councils,nin decision-making capacities,,and I gave my religion a free pass,because I loved it. 
 Until I stopped,,and I realized that I hadnbeen allowing myself to be treated,as the support staffnto the real work of men.,And I faced this contradiction in myself,,and I joined with other activistsnin my community.,We've been working very, very, very hardnfor the last decade and more. 
 The first thing we didnwas raise consciousness.,You can't change what you can't see.,We started podcasting,nblogging, writing articles.,I created lists of hundreds of ways,that men and womennare unequal in our community. 
 The next thing we didnwas build advocacy organizations.,We tried to do thingsnthat were unignorable,,like wearing pants to churchnand trying to attend all-male meetings.,These seem like simple things,,but to us, the organizers,nthey were enormously costly.,We lost relationships. We lost jobs.,We got hate mail on a daily basis.,We were attacked in social medianand national press.,We received death threats.,We lost standing in our community.nSome of us got excommunicated.,Most of us got putnin front of a disciplinary council,,and were rejectednfrom the communities that we loved,because we wanted to make them better,nbecause we believed that they could be. 
 And I began to expect this reactionnfrom my own people.,I know what it feels like when you feelnlike someone's trying to change you,or criticize you.,But what utterly shocked menwas throughout all of this work,I received equal measures of vitriolnfrom the secular left,,the same vehemence as the religious right.,And what my secular friends didn't realizenwas that this religious hostility,,these phrases of, "Oh, all religiousnpeople are crazy or stupid.","Don't pay attention to religion.","They're going to benhomophobic and sexist.",What they didn't understand,was that that type of hostilityndid not fight religious extremism,,it bred religious extremism.,Those arguments don't work,nand I know because I remember,someone telling menthat I was stupid for being Mormon.,And what it caused me to donwas defend myself and my people,and everything we believe in,nbecause we're not stupid. 
 So criticism and hostility doesn't work,nand I didn't listen to these arguments.,When I hear these arguments,nI still continue to bristle,,because I have family and friends.,These are my people,nand I'm the first to defend them,,but the struggle is real.,How do we respectnsomeone's religious beliefs,while still holding them accountablenfor the harm or damage,that those beliefs may cause others?,It's a tough question.nI still don't have a perfect answer.,My parents and I have been walkingnon this tightrope for the last decade.,They're intelligent people.nThey're lovely people.,And let me try to help younunderstand their perspective.,In Mormonism, we believenthat after you die,,if you keep all the rulesnand you follow all the rituals,,you can be together as a family again.,And to my parents,nme doing something as simple,as having a sleeveless top right now,nshowing my shoulders,,that makes me unworthy.,I won't be with my familynin the eternities.,But even more, I had a brotherndie in a tragic accident at 15,,and something as simple as thisnmeans we won't be together as a family.,And to my parents, they cannot understand,why something as simplenas fashion or women's rights,would prevent menfrom seeing my brother again.,And that's the mindsetnthat we're dealing with,,and criticism does not change that.,And so my parents and Inhave been walking this tightrope,,explaining our sides,nrespecting one another,,but actually invalidatingneach other's very basic beliefs,by the way we live our lives,nand it's been difficult.,The way that we've been able to do that,is to get past those defensive shells,and really see the soft insidenof unbelief and belief,and try to respect each othernwhile still holding boundaries clear. 
 The other thing that the secular leftnand the atheists and the orthodox,and the religious right,nwhat they all don't understand,was why even carenabout religious activism?,I cannot tell you the hundredsnof people who have said,,"If you don't like religion, just leave.",Why would you try to change it?,Because what is taught on the Sabbath,leaks into our politics,nour health policy,,violence around the world.,It leaks into education,nmilitary, fiscal decision-making.,These laws get legallynand culturally codified.,In fact, my own religion has hadnan enormous effect on this nation.,For example, during Prop 8,nmy church raised over 22 million dollars,to fight same-sex marriage in California.,Forty years ago,npolitical historians will say,,that if it wasn't for the Mormonnopposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,,we'd have an Equal Rights Amendmentnin our Constitution today.,How many lives did that affect?,And we can spend timenfighting every single one,of these little tiny laws and rules,,or we can ask ourselves,,why is gender inequalitynthe default around the world?,Why is that the assumption? 
 Because religion doesn't justncreate the roots of morality,,it creates the seeds of normality.,Religions can liberate or subjugate,,they can empower or exploit,nthey can comfort or destroy,,and the people that tip the scalesnover to the ethical and the moral,are often not those in charge.,Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.,We need to take them seriously.,But it's not easy to influence a religion,nlike we just talked about. 
 But I'll tell younwhat my people have done.,My groups are small,nthere's hundreds of us,,but we've had huge impact.,Right now, women's picturesnare hanging in the halls next to men,for the first time.,Women are now allowednto pray in our church-wide meetings,,and they never were beforenin the general conferences.,As of last week, in a historic move,,three women were invitedndown to three leadership boards,that oversee the entire church.,We've seen perceptual shiftsnin the Mormon community,that allow for talk of gender inequality.,We've opened up space,nregardless of being despised,,for more conservative womennto step in and make real changes,,and the words "women" and "the priesthood"ncan now be uttered in the same sentence.,I never had that.,My daughter and my nieces are inheritingna religion that I never had,,that's more equal -- we've had an effect. 
 It wasn't easy standing in those lines,trying to get into those male meetings.,There were hundreds of us,,and one by one, when we got to the door,,we were told, "I'm sorry,nthis meeting is just for men,",and we had to step backnand watch men get into the meeting,as young as 12 years old,,escorted and walked past usnas we all stood in line.,But not one woman in that linenwill forget that day,,and not one little boynthat walked past us will forget that day. 
 If we were a multinational corporationnor a government, and that had happened,,there would be outrage,,but we're just a religion.,We're all just part of religions.,We can't keep lookingnat religion that way,,because it doesn't only affect me,nit affects my daughter,and all of your daughtersnand what opportunities they have,,what they can wear,nwho they can love and marry,,if they have accessnto reproductive healthcare.,We need to reclaim moralitynin a secular context,that creates ethical scrutinynand accountability,for religions all around the world,,but we need to do it in a respectful way,that breeds cooperation and not extremism.,And we can do it throughnunignorable acts of bravery,,standing up for gender equality. 
 It's time that halfnof the world's population,had voice and equalitynwithin our world's religions,,churches, synagogues, mosquesnand shrines around the world.,I'm working on my people.nWhat are you doing for yours? 
 (Applause)There's something about caves --,a shadowy opening in a limestonencliff that draws you in.,As you pass through the portalnbetween light and dark,,you enter a subterranean world --,a place of perpetual gloom,nof earthy smells, of hushed silence. 
 Long ago in Europe,,ancient people also enterednthese underground worlds.,As witness to their passage,,they left behind mysteriousnengravings and paintings,,like this panel of humans, trianglesnand zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain.,You now walk the same pathnas these early artists.,And in this surreal, otherworldly place,,it's almost possible to imagine,that you hear the muffled footfallnof skin boots on soft earth,,or that you see the flickering of a torchnaround the next bend. 
 When I'm in a cave,,I often find myself wonderingnwhat drove these people to go so deep,to brave dangerous and narrownpassageways to leave their mark?,In this video clip,,that was shot half a kilometer,nor about a third of a mile, underground,,in the cave of Cudon in Spain,,we found a seriesnof red paintings on a ceiling,in a previously unexplorednsection of the cave.,As we crawled forward, military-style,nwith the ceiling getting ever lower,,we finally got to a pointnwhere the ceiling was so low,that my husbandnand project photographer, Dylan,,could no longer achieve focusnon the ceiling with his DSLR camera.,So while he filmed me,,I kept following the trail of red paintnwith a single light,and a point-and-shoot cameranthat we kept for that type of occasion.,Half a kilometer underground. 
 Seriously.,What was somebody doing down therenwith a torch or a stone lamp? 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean -- me, it makes sense, right? 
 But you know,,this is the kind of question thatnI'm trying to answer with my research.,I study some of the oldestnart in the world.,It was created by thesenearly artists in Europe,,between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.,And the thing is,that I'm not just studying itnbecause it's beautiful,,though some of it certainly is.,But what I'm interested innis the development of the modern mind,,of the evolution of creativity,nof imagination, of abstract thought,,about what it means to be human.,While all species communicatenin one way or another,,only we humans have reallyntaken it to another level.,Our desire and abilitynto share and collaborate,has been a huge part of our success story.,Our modern world is based on a globalnnetwork of information exchange,made possible, in large part,nby our ability to communicate --,in particular, using graphicnor written forms of communication.,The thing is, though,,that we've been buildingnon the mental achievements,of those that came before us for so long,that it's easy to forget that certainnabilities haven't already existed.,It's one of the thingsnI find most fascinating,about studying our deep history.,Those people didn't have the shouldersnof any giants to stand on.,They were the original shoulders.,And while a surprising numbernof important inventions,come out of that distant time,,what I want to talk to you about todaynis the invention of graphic communication. 
 There are threenmain types of communication,,spoken, gestural --nso things like sign language --,and graphic communication.,Spoken and gestural arenby their very nature ephemeral.,It requires close contactnfor a message to be sent and received.,And after the momentnof transmission, it's gone forever.,Graphic communication, on the other hand,ndecouples that relationship.,And with its invention,nit became possible for the first time,for a message to bentransmitted and preserved,beyond a single moment in place and time. 
 Europe is one of the first places,that we start to see graphic marksnregularly appearing,in caves, rock sheltersnand even a few surviving open-air sites.,But this is not the Europe we know today.,This was a world dominatednby towering ice sheets,,three to four kilometers high,,with sweeping grass plainsnand frozen tundra.,This was the Ice Age. 
 Over the last century,,more than 350 Ice Age rock art sitesnhave been found across the continent,,decorated with animals, abstract shapesnand even the occasional human,like these engraved figuresnfrom Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.,They provide us with a rare glimpse,into the creative world and imaginationnof these early artists. 
 Since their discovery,,it's been the animals that have receivednthe majority of the study,like this black horsenfrom Cullalvera in Spain,,or this unusual purple bisonnfrom La Pasiega.,But for me, it was the abstract shapes,nwhat we call geometric signs,,that drew me to study the art.,The funny this is that at most sites,the geometric signs far outnumbernthe animal and human images.,But when I started on this back in 2007,,there wasn't even a definitive listnof how many shapes there were,,nor was there a strong sense,of whether the same onesnappeared across space or time.,Before I could evennget started on my questions,,my first step was to compile a database,of all known geometric signsnfrom all of the rock art sites.,The problem was that while they werenwell documented at some sites,,usually the onesnwith the very nice animals,,there was also a large number of themnwhere it was very vague --,there wasn't a lotnof description or detail.,Some of them hadn't been visitednin half a century or more.,These were the onesnthat I targeted for my field work. 
 Over the course of two years,,my faithful husband Dylan and Ineach spent over 300 hours underground,,hiking, crawling and wrigglingnaround 52 sites,in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.,And it was totally worth it.,We found new, undocumented geometric signsnat 75 percent of the sites we visited.,This is the level of accuracynI knew I was going to need,if I wanted to start answeringnthose larger questions. 
 So let's get to those answers.,Barring a handful of outliers,nthere are only 32 geometric signs.,Only 32 signs,across a 30,000-year time spannand the entire continent of Europe.,That is a very small number.,Now, if these were randomndoodles or decorations,,we would expect to seena lot more variation,,but instead what we findnare the same signs,repeating across both space and time.,Some signs start out strong,nbefore losing popularity and vanishing,,while other signs are later inventions.,But 65 percent of those signs stayednin use during that entire time period --,things like lines, rectanglesntriangles, ovals and circles,like we see herenfrom the end of the Ice Age,,at a 10,000-year-old sitenhigh in the Pyrenees Mountains.,And while certain signsnspan thousands of kilometers,,other signs had much morenrestricted distribution patterns,,with some being limitednto a single territory,,like we see herenwith these divided rectangles,that are only found in northern Spain,,and which some researchers have speculated,could be some sortnof family or clan signs. 
 On a side note,,there is surprising degreenof similarity in the earliest rock art,found all the way from France and Spainnto Indonesia and Australia.,With many of the same signsnappearing in such far-flung places,,especially in that 30,000nto 40,000-year range,,it's starting to seem increasingly likely,that this invention actually traces backnto a common point of origin in Africa.,But that I'm afraid,nis a subject for a future talk. 
 So back to the matter at hand.,There could be no doubt that these signsnwere meaningful to their creators,,like these 25,000-year-oldnbas-relief sculptures,from La Roque de Venasque in France.,We might not know what they meant,nbut the people of the time certainly did.,The repetition of the same signs,nfor so long, and at so many sites,tells us that the artistsnwere making intentional choices.,If we're talking about geometric shapes,,with specific, culturally recognized,nagreed-upon meanings,,than we could very well be looking,at one of the oldest systemsnof graphic communication in the world. 
 I'm not talking about writing yet.,There's just not enoughncharacters at this point,to have represented all of the wordsnin the spoken language,,something which is a requirementnfor a full writing system.,Nor do we see the signsnrepeating regularly enough,to suggest that they werensome sort of alphabet.,But what we do havenare some intriguing one-offs,,like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,nknown as "The Inscription,",with its symmetrical markings on the left,,possible stylized representationsnof hands in the middle,,and what looks a bitnlike a bracket on the right. 
 The oldest systems of graphicncommunication in the world --,Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,nthe earliest Chinese script,,all emerged between 4,000nand 5,000 years ago,,with each coming into existencenfrom an earlier protosystem,made up of counting marksnand pictographic representations,,where the meaningnand the image were the same.,So a picture of a bird would reallynhave represented that animal.,It's only later that we start to seenthese pictographs become more stylized,,until they almost become unrecognizable,and that we also start to seenmore symbols being invented,to represent all those othernmissing words in language --,things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives. 
 So knowing all this,,it seems highly unlikely thatnthe geometric signs from Ice Age Europe,were truly abstract written characters.,Instead, what's much more likely,is that these early artistsnwere also making counting marks,,maybe like this row of linesnfrom Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,,as well as creatingnstylized representations,of things from the world around them.,Could some of the signsnbe weaponry or housing?,Or what about celestial objectsnlike star constellations?,Or maybe even rivers, mountains,ntrees -- landscape features,,possibly like this black penniformnsurrounded by strange bell-shaped signs,from the site of El Castillo in Spain.,The term penniformnmeans "feather-shaped" in Latin,,but could this actually bena depiction of a plant or a tree?,Some researchers have begunnto ask these questions,about certain signs at specific sites,,but I believe the time has comento revisit this category as a whole.,The irony in all of this, of course,,is that having just carefully classifiednall of the signs into a single category,,I have a feeling that my next stepnwill involve breaking it back apart,as different types of imagerynare identified and separated off. 
 Now don't get me wrong,,the later creationnof fully developed writing,was an impressive feat in its own right.,But it's important to remember,that those early writing systemsndidn't come out of a vacuum.,And that even 5,000 years ago,,people were already buildingnon something much older,,with its origins stretching backntens of thousands of years --,to the geometric signsnof Ice Age Europe and far beyond,,to that point, deepnin our collective history,,when someone first came up with the ideanof making a graphic mark,,and forever changed the naturenof how we communicate. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Great things happen at intersections.,In fact, I would arguenthat some of the most interesting things,of the human experiencenoccur at the intersections,,in the liminal space,,where by liminalnI mean the space in-between.,There's freedom in that in-between,,freedom to create from the indefinitenessnof not-quite-here, not-quite-there,,a new self-definition.,Some of the great intersectionsnof the world come to mind,,like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,,or Times Square in New York City,,both bustling with the excitementnof a seemingly endless stream of people.,Other intersections,,like the Edmund Pettus Bridgenin Selma, Alabama,,or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Courtnin Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind,because of the tremendous energynat the intersection of human beings,,ideologies and the ongoingnstruggle for justice. 
 Beyond the physicalnlandscape of our planet,,some of the most famous celestial imagesnare of intersections.,Stars are born at the messynintersection of gas and dust,,instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.,Stars die by this same intersection,nthis time flung outward,in a violent collision of smaller atoms,,intersecting and efficiently fusingninto altogether new and heavier things.,We can all think of intersectionsnthat have special meaning to us.,To be intersectional, then,,is to occupy a positionnat an intersection. 
 I've lived the entirety of my lifenin the in-between,,in the liminal spacenbetween dreams and reality,,race and gender,,poverty and plenty,,science and society.,I am both black and a woman.,Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,,this robust combination of knowingnresults in a shining example,of the explosive fusion of identities. 
 I am also an astrophysicist.,I study blazars, supermassive,nhyperactive black holes,that sit at the centersnof massive galaxies,and shoot out jetsnnearby those black holes,at speeds approaching the speed of light,in a process we are still tryingnto completely understand. 
 I have dreamednof becoming an astrophysicist,since I was 12 years old.,I had no idea that at that time,,according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archivenof African-American women in physics,,only 18 black women in the United Statesnhad ever earned a PhD,in a physics-related discipline,,and that the first black woman to graduatenwith a PhD in an astronomy-related field,did so just one year before my birth. 
 As I journeyed along my path,,I encountered the best and worstnof life at an intersection:,the tremendous opportunity to self-define,,the collision of expectationnand experience,,the exhilarationnof victorious breakthroughs,and, sometimes,,the explosive pain of regeneration. 
 I began my college experiencenjust after my family had fallen apart.,Our financial situation disintegrated,just after my father'sndeparture from our lives.,This thrust my mother, my sister and I,out of the relative comfortnof middle-class life,and into the almost constant strugglento make ends meet.,Thus, I was one of roughlyn60 percent of women of color,who find finances to be a major barriernto their educational goals.,Thankfully, Norfolk State Universitynprovided me with full funding,,and I was able to achievenmy bachelor's in physics. 
 After graduation, and despite knowingnthat I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,,I fell through the cracks.,It was a poster that saved my dream,,and some really incrediblenpeople and programs.,The American Physical Societynhad this beautiful poster,encouraging students of colornto become physicists.,It was striking to menbecause it featured a young black girl,,probably around 12 years old,,looking studiouslynat some physics equations.,I remember thinking,I was looking directly backnat the little girl,who first dared to dream this dream.,I immediately wrote to the Society,and requested my personalncopy of the poster,,which to this daynstill hangs in my office.,I described to them in the emailnmy educational path,,and my desire to find myself againnin pursuit of the PhD.,They directed me to the Fisk-VanderbiltnUniversity Bridge Program,,itself an intersectionnof the master's and PhD degrees,at two institutions.,After two years out of school,nthey accepted me into the program,,and I found myself againnon the path to the PhD. 
 After receiving my master's at Fisk,,I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.,Once I was physically occupyingnthe space that would ultimately give way,to my childhood aspirations,,I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD. 
 (Laughter) 
 It became immediately apparent,that not everyone was thrillednto have that degree of liminality,in their space.,I was ostracized by many of my classmates,,one of whom went so far as to invite mento "do what I really came here to do",as he pushed all the dirty dishesnfrom our meal in front of me to clean up.,I wish that were an isolated occurrence,,but for many women of color,in science, technology, engineering,nand mathematics, or STEM,,this is something they have long endured.,One hundred percentnof the 60 women of color,interviewed in a recent studynby Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings,reported facing racialized gender bias,,including being mistakennfor the janitorial staff.,This mistaken identity was not reported,by any of the white womenninterviewed for this study,,which comprised 557 women in total.,While there is nothing inherently wrongnwith a janitorial position,,and in fact my forefathers and foremothersnwere able to attend college,because many of their parentsnworked these jobs,,it was a clear attemptnto put me in my place. 
 While there was certainlynthe acute pain of the encounter,,the real issue is that my appearance,can tell anyone anything about my ability.,Beyond that, though, it underscores,that the women of color in STEMndo not experience the same set of barriers,that just womennor just people of color face.,That's why today I want to highlightnwomen of color in STEM,,who are inexorably, unapologetically,living as the inseparablensum of identities. 
 STEM itself is an intersectional term,,such that its true richnessncannot be appreciated,without consideringnthe liminal space between disciplines.,Science, the pursuitnof understanding the physical world,by way of chemistry, physics, biology,,cannot be accomplishednin the absence of mathematics.,Engineering requires the applicationnof basic science and math,to the lived experience.,Technology sits firmlynon the foundation of math,,engineering and science.,Math itself servesnthe critical role of Rosetta Stone,,decoding and encodingnthe physical principles of the world.,STEM is utterly incompletenwithout each individual piece.,This is to say nothingnof the enrichment that is realized,when STEM is combinednwith other disciplines. 
 The purpose for this talk is twofold:,first, to say directly to every black,nLatina, indigenous, First Nation,or any other woman or girl,who finds herself restingnat the blessed intersection,of race and gender,,that you can be anything you want to be.,My personal hope isnthat you'll become an astrophysicist,,but beyond that, anything you want.,Do not think for one minute,that because you are who you are,,you cannot benwho you imagine yourself to be.,Hold fast to those dreams,and let them carry youninto a world you can't even imagine. 
 Secondly, among the mostnpressing issues of our time,,most now findntheir intersection with STEM.,We have as a global society solved,most of the single-facetednissues of our time.,Those that remainnrequire a thorough investigation,of the liminal space between disciplines,to create the multifacetednsolutions of tomorrow.,Who better to solve these liminal problems,than those who have facedntheir whole lives at the intersections.,We as thought leaders and decision makers,must push pastnthe first steps of diversity,and into the richernand more robust territory,of full inclusion and equal opportunity. 
 One of my favorite examplesnof liminal excellence,comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,,a black woman plasma physicist,,who passed away this past Julynafter a 10-year bout with breast cancer.,She was a NASA project scientistnwho spearheaded the NASA side,of the Rosetta mission,,which became famous this yearnfor landing a rover on a comet,,and the 1.5 billion dollarnGalileo mission to Jupiter,,two high-profile scientific victories,for NASA, the United Statesnand the world.,Dr. Alexander said it this way:,"I'm used to walking between two cultures.,For me, it's among the purposes of my life,to take us from states of ignorancento states of understanding,with bold explorationnthat you can't do every day." 
 This shows exactlynthe power of a liminal person.,She had the technical ability to spearhead,some of the most ambitiousnspace missions of our time,,and she perfectly understood her place,of being exactly who she wasnin any place she was. 
 Jessica Matthews, inventornof the SOCCKET line of sports products,,like soccer balls, that generatenrenewable energy as you play with them,,said it this way:,"A major part of inventionnisn't just creating things,,it's understanding people,and understanding the systemsnthat make this world.",The reason I tell my story,and the story of Dr. Alexandernand Jessica Matthews,is because they are fundamentallynintersectional stories,,the stories of lives lived at the nexusnof race, gender and innovation. 
 Despite implicit and explicit questionsnof my right to be in an elite space,,I'm proud to report that when I graduated,,I was the first black womannto earn a PhD in astrophysics,in Yale's then 312-year history. 
 (Applause) 
 I am now part of a small but growing cadrenof women of color in STEM,who are poised to bring new perspectivesnand new ideas to life,on the most pressing issues of our time:,things like educational inequities,,police brutality, HIV/AIDS,nclimate change, genetic editing,,artificial intelligencenand Mars exploration.,This is to say nothing of the thingsnwe haven't even thought of yet. 
 Women of color in STEMnoccupy some of the toughest,and most exciting sociotechnologicalnissues of our time.,Thus, we are uniquely positioned,to contribute tonand drive these conversations,in ways that are more inclusivenof a wider variety of lived experience.,This outlook can be expandednto the many intersectional people,whose experiences, positive and negative,,enrich the conversationsnin ways that outmatch,even the best-resourced homogenous groups. 
 This is not a requestnborn out of a desire to fit in.,It's a reminder that we cannot getnto the best possible outcomes,for the totality of humanity,without precisely this collaboration,,this bringing together of the liminal,,the differently lived,ndistinctly experienced,and disparately impacted.,Simply put, we cannot benthe most excellent expression,of our collective genius,without the full measurenof humanity brought to bear. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is one of the most amazing animalsnon the face of the Earth.,This is a tapir.,Now this, this is a baby tapir,,the cutest animal offspringnin the animal kingdom. 
 (Laughter) 
 By far.,There is no competition here. 
 I have dedicatednthe past 20 years of my life,to the research and conservationnof tapirs in Brazil,,and it has been absolutely amazing.,But at the moment,nI've been thinking really, really hard,about the impact of my work.,I've been questioning myselfnabout the real contributions I have made,for the conservationnof these animals I love so much.,Am I being effective,in safeguarding their survival?,Am I doing enough?,I guess the big question here is,,am I studying tapirsnand contributing to their conservation,,or am I just documenting their extinction? 
 The world is facingnso many different conservation crises.,We all know that.nIt's all over the news every day.,Tropical forests and other ecosystemsnare being destroyed,,climate change, so many speciesnon the brink of extinction:,tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs. 
 This is the lowland tapir,nthe tapir species I work with,,the largest terrestrial mammalnof South America.,They're massive. They're powerful.,Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.,That's half the size of a horse.,They're gorgeous. 
 Tapirs are mostly foundnin tropical forests such as the Amazon,,and they absolutely neednlarge patches of habitat,in order to find all the resourcesnthey need to reproduce and survive.,But their habitat is being destroyed,,and they have been hunted out of severalnparts of their geographic distribution. 
 And you see, this isnvery, very unfortunate,because tapirs are extremely importantnfor the habitats where they are found.,They're herbivores.,Fifty percent of their dietnconsists of fruit,,and when they eat the fruit,nthey swallow the seeds,,which they disperse throughoutnthe habitat through their feces.,They play this major rolenin shaping and maintaining,the structure and diversity of the forest,,and for that reason, tapirs are knownnas gardeners of the forest.,Isn't that amazing?,If you think about it,,the extinction of tapirsnwould seriously affect,biodiversity as a whole. 
 I started my tapir work in 1996,nstill very young, fresh out of college,,and it was a pioneer researchnand conservation program.,At that point, we had nearlynzero information about tapirs,,mostly because they'renso difficult to study.,They're nocturnal, solitary,nvery elusive animals,,and we got started gettingnvery basic data about these animals. 
 But what is itnthat a conservationist does?,Well, first, we need data.,We need field research.,We need those long-term datasetsnto support conservation action,,and I told you tapirsnare very hard to study,,so we have to relynon indirect methods to study them.,We have to capture and anesthetize them,so that we can install GPS collarsnaround their necks,and follow their movements,,which is a technique used by manynother conservationists around the world.,And then we can gather informationnabout how they use space,,how they move through the landscape,,what are their priority habitats,,and so much more. 
 Next, we must disseminate what we learn.,We have to educate people about tapirs,and how important these animals are.,And it's amazingnhow many people around the world,do not know what a tapir is.,In fact, many people thinknthis is a tapir.,Let me tell you, this is not a tapir. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a giant anteater.,Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever. 
 And then next we have to providentraining, capacity building.,It is our responsibility to preparenthe conservationists of the future.,We are losing severalnconservation battles,,and we need more people doing what we do,,and they need the skills,nand they need the passion to do that.,Ultimately, we conservationists,,we must be able to apply our data,,to apply our accumulated knowledge,to support actual conservation action.,Our first tapir program,took place in the Atlantic Forest,in the eastern part of Brazil,,one of the most threatenednbiomes in the world.,The destruction of the Atlantic Forest,began in the early 1500s,,when the Portuguesenfirst arrived in Brazil,,beginning European colonizationnin the eastern part of South America.,This forest was almost completely cleared,for timber, agriculture, cattle ranchingnand the construction of cities,,and today only seven percentnof the Atlantic forest,is still left standing.,And tapirs are found in very, very small,nisolated, disconnected populations.,In the Atlantic Forest, we found outnthat tapirs move through open areas,of pastureland and agriculture,going from one patch of forestnto patch of forest.,So our main approach in this region,was to use our tapir datanto identify the potential places,for the establishmentnof wildlife corridors,in between those patches of forest,,reconnecting the habitat,so that tapirs and many other animalsncould cross the landscape safely. 
 After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,,in 2008, we expanded our tapirnconservation efforts to the Pantanal,in the western part of Brazil,near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.,This is the largest continuousnfreshwater floodplain in the world,,an incredible place,and one of the most important strongholdsnfor lowland tapirs in South America.,And working in the Pantanalnhas been extremely refreshing,because we found large,nhealthy tapir populations in the area,,and we have been able to study tapirs,in the most natural conditionsnwe'll ever find,,very much free of threats. 
 In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,nwe are using another technique:,camera traps.,This camera is equippednwith a movement sensor,and it photographs animalsnwhen they walk in front of it.,So thanks to these amazing devices,,we have been ablento gather precious information,about tapir reproductionnand social organization,which are very importantnpieces of the puzzle,when you're trying to developnthose conservation strategies. 
 And right now, 2015,nwe are expanding our work once again,to the Brazilian Cerrado,,the open grasslands and shrub forestsnin the central part of Brazil.,Today this region is the very epicenternof economic development in my country,,where natural habitatnand wildlife populations,are rapidly being eradicatednby several different threats,,including once again cattle ranching,,large sugarcane and soybean plantations,,poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.,And somehow, tapirs are still there,,which gives me a lot of hope.,But I have to say that startingnthis new program in the Cerrado,was a bit of a slap in the face.,When you drive around,and you find dead tapirsnalong the highways,and signs of tapirs wandering aroundnin the middle of sugarcane plantations,where they shouldn't be,,and you talk to kids and they tell younthat they know how tapir meat tastes,because their families poach and eat them,,it really breaks your heart. 
 The situation in the Cerradonmade me realize --,it gave me the sense of urgency.,I am swimming against the tide.,It made me realize that despitentwo decades of hard work,trying to save these animals,nwe still have so much work to do,if we are to prevent themnfrom disappearing.,We have to find waysnto solve all these problems.,We really do, and you know what?,We really came to a pointnin the conservation world,where we have to think out of the box.,We'll have to be a lot more creativenthan we are right now.,And I told you, roadkill is a big problemnfor tapirs in the Cerrado,,so we just came up with the ideanof putting reflective stickers,on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.,These are the same stickersnused on big trucks,to avoid collision.,Tapirs cross the highways after dark,,so the stickers will hopefullynhelp drivers see this shining thing,crossing the highway,,and maybe they willnslow down a little bit.,For now, this is just a crazy idea.,We don't know. We'll see if it willnreduce the amount of tapir roadkill.,But the point is, maybe this isnthe kind of stuff that needs to be done. 
 And although I'm strugglingnwith all these questions,in my mind right now,,I have a pact with tapirs.,I know in my heart,that tapir conservation is my cause.,This is my passion.,I am not alone.,I have this huge networknof supporters behind me,,and there is no waynI'm ever going to stop.,I will continue doing this,nmost probably for the rest of my life.,And I'll keep doing thisnfor Patrícia, my namesake,,one of the first tapirs we capturednand monitored in the Atlantic Forest,many, many years ago;,for Rita and her baby Vincentnin the Pantanal.,And I'll keep doing this for Ted,na baby tapir we captured,in December last yearnalso in the Pantanal. 
 And I will keep doing this,for the hundreds of tapirsnthat I've had the pleasure to meet,over the years,and the many others I knownI will encounter in the future.,These animals deserve to be cared for.,They need me. They need us.,And you know? We human beingsndeserve to live in a world,where we can get out therenand see and benefit from,not only tapirs,but all the other beautiful species,,now and in the future. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)Interpreter: Piano, "p,"nis my favorite musical symbol.,It means to play softly.,If you're playing a musical instrumentnand you notice a "p" in the score,,you need to play softer.,Two p's -- even softer.,Four p's -- extremely soft.,This is my drawing of a p-tree,,which demonstrates,no matter how many thousandsnupon thousands of p's there may be,,you'll never reach complete silence.,That's my current definition of silence:,a very obscure sound. 
 I'd like to share a little bit,about the historynof American Sign Language, ASL,,plus a bit of my own background.,French sign language was broughtnto America during the early 1800s,,and as time went by,nmixed with local signs,,it evolved into the languagenwe know today as ASL.,So it has a history of about 200 years. 
 I was born deaf,,and I was taught to believenthat sound wasn't a part of my life.,And I believed it to be true.,Yet, I realize nownthat that wasn't the case at all.,Sound was very much a part of my life,,really, on my mind every day.,As a Deaf person livingnin a world of sound,,it's as if I was livingnin a foreign country,,blindly following its rules,ncustoms, behaviors and norms,without ever questioning them. 
 So how is it that I understand sound?,Well, I watch how peoplenbehave and respond to sound.,You people are like my loudspeakers,nand amplify sound.,I learn and mirror that behavior.,At the same time,nI've learned that I create sound,,and I've seen how people respond to me.,Thus I've learned, for example ...,"Don't slam the door!","Don't make too much noise whennyou're eating from the potato-chip bag!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Don't burp,,and when you're eating,,make sure you don't scrapenyour utensils on the plate.",All of these thingsnI term "sound etiquette.",Maybe I think about sound etiquette,more than the average hearing person does.,I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.,And I'm always waitingnin eager nervous anticipation,around sound, about what's to come next. 
 Hence, this drawing.,TBD, to be decided.,TBC, to be continued.,TBA, to be announced.,And you notice the staff --,there are no notes contained in the lines.,That's because the linesnalready contain sound,through the subtle smudges and smears. 
 In Deaf culture,nmovement is equivalent to sound.,This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.,A typical staff contains five lines.,Yet for me, signing itnwith my thumb sticking up like that,doesn't feel natural.,That's why you'll notice in my drawings,nI stick to four lines on paper. 
 In the year 2008, I had the opportunitynto travel to Berlin, Germany,,for an artist residency there.,Prior to this time,nI had been working as a painter.,During this summer, I visitedndifferent museums and gallery spaces,,and as I went from one place to the next,,I noticed there was no visual art there.,At that time, sound was trending,nand this struck me ...,there was no visual art,,everything was auditory. 
 Now sound has come into my art territory.,Is it going to furtherndistance me from art?,I realized that doesn'tnhave to be the case at all.,I actually know sound.,I know it so well,that it doesn't have to be somethingnjust experienced through the ears.,It could be felt tactually,,or experienced as a visual,,or even as an idea. 
 So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound,and to put it into my art practice.,And everything that I had beenntaught regarding sound,,I decided to do away with and unlearn.,I started creating a new body of work.,And when I presented thisnto the art community,,I was blown away with the amountnof support and attention I received.,I realized:,sound is like money,,power, control --,social currency.,In the back of my mind, I've always feltnthat sound was your thing,,a hearing person's thing.,And sound is so powerful,that it could eitherndisempower me and my artwork,,or it could empower me.,I chose to be empowered. 
 There's a massive culturenaround spoken language.,And just because I don't usenmy literal voice to communicate,,in society's eyesnit's as if I don't have a voice at all.,So I need to work with individualsnwho can support me as an equal,and become my voice.,And that way, I'm able to maintainnrelevancy in society today. 
 So at school, at work and institutions,,I work with manyndifferent ASL interpreters.,And their voice becomesnmy voice and identity.,They help me to be heard.,And their voices hold value and currency.,Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,,I'm able to maintainna temporary form of currency,,kind of like taking out a loannwith a very high interest rate.,If I didn't continue this practice,,I feel that I could justnfade off into oblivion,and not maintainnany form of social currency. 
 So with sound as my new art medium,,I delved into the world of music.,And I was surprised to seenthe similarities between music and ASL.,For example,,a musical note,cannot be fully capturednand expressed on paper.,And the same holds truenfor a concept in ASL.,They're both highly spatialnand highly inflected --,meaning that subtle changes,can affect the entire meaning,of both signs and sounds. 
 I'd like to share with youna piano metaphor,,to have you have a betternunderstanding of how ASL works.,So, envision a piano.,ASL is broken down intonmany different grammatical parameters.,If you assign a different parameternto each finger as you play the piano --,such as facial expression, body movement,,speed, hand shape and so on,,as you play the piano --,English is a linear language,,as if one key is being pressed at a time.,However, ASL is more like a chord --,all 10 fingers neednto come down simultaneously,to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.,If just one of those keysnwere to change the chord,,it would create a completelyndifferent meaning.,The same applies to musicnin regards to pitch, tone and volume.,In ASL, by playing around with thesendifferent grammatical parameters,,you can express different ideas. 
 For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.,This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.,I'm looking at you.,Staring at you. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh -- busted. 
 (Laughter) 
 Uh-oh.,What are you looking at?,Aw, stop. 
 (Laughter) 
 I then started thinking,,"What if I was to look at ASLnthrough a musical lens?",If I was to create a signnand repeat it over and over,,it could becomenlike a piece of visual music.,For example, this is the sign for "day,",as the sun rises and sets.,This is "all day.",If I was to repeat it and slow it down,,visually it looks like a piece of music.,All ... day.,I feel the same holds truenfor "all night.","All night.",This is ALL-NIGHT,nrepresented in this drawing.,And this led me to thinkingnabout three different kinds of nights:,"last night,","overnight,",(Sings) "all night long." 
 (Laughter) 
 I feel like the third one hasna lot more musicality than the other two. 
 (Laughter) 
 This represents how timenis expressed in ASL,and how the distance from your bodyncan express the changes in time.,For example,,1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,,present tense happens closestnand in front of the body,,future is in front of the bodynand the past is to your back.,So, the first examplenis "a long time ago.",Then "past,","used to",and the last one, which is my favorite,,with the very romanticnand dramatic notion to it,,"once upon a time." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Common time",is a musical term,with a specific time signaturenof four beats per measure.,Yet when I see the word "common time,",what automatically comes to mind for menis "at the same time.",So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.,We have the staffnacross the head and the chest. 
 [Head: RH, Flash claw] 
 [Common time] 
 [Chest: LH, Flash claw] 
 I'm now going to demonstratena hand shape called the "flash claw.",Can you please follow along with me?,Everybody, hands up.,Now we're going to do itnin both the head and the chest,,kind of like "common time"nor at the same time.,Yes, got it.,That means "to fall in love"nin International [Sign]. 
 (Laughter) 
 International [Sign], as a note,,is a visual tool to help communicate,across cultures and sign languagesnaround the world. 
 The second one I'd likento demonstrate is this --,please follow along with me again.,And now this.,This is "colonization" in ASL. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now the third --,please follow along again.,And again.,This is "enlightenment" in ASL.,So let's do all three together.,"Fall in love,","colonization",and "enlightenment.",Good job, everyone. 
 (Laughter) 
 Notice how all three signsnare very similar,,they all happen at the head and the chest,,but they convey quite different meanings. 
 So it's amazing to seenhow ASL is alive and thriving,,just like music is.,However, in this day and age,,we live in a very audio-centric world.,And just because ASL has no sound to it,,it automatically holds no social currency.,We need to start thinking hardernabout what defines social currency,and allow ASL to developnits own form of currency --,without sound.,And this could possibly be a stepnto lead to a more inclusive society.,And maybe people will understand,that you don't neednto be deaf to learn ASL,,nor do you have to be hearingnto learn music. 
 ASL is such a rich treasure,that I'd like younto have the same experience.,And I'd like to invite younto open your ears,,to open your eyes,,take part in our culture,and experience our visual language.,And you never know,,you might just fall in love with us. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me. 
 (Applause)As a singer-songwriter,,people often ask me about my influencesnor, as I like to call them,,my sonic lineages.,And I could easily tell you,that I was shaped by the jazznand hip hop that I grew up with,,by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,,or by the 1980s popnon my childhood radio stations.,But beyond genre,nthere is another question:,how do the sounds we hear every dayninfluence the music that we make?,I believe that everyday soundscape,can be the most unexpectedninspiration for songwriting,,and to look at this ideana little bit more closely,,I'm going to talk todaynabout three things:,nature, language and silence --,or rather, the impossibilitynof true silence.,And through this I hope to give youna sense of a world,already alive with musical expression,,with each of us servingnas active participants,,whether we know it or not. 
 I'm going to start today with nature,nbut before we do that,,let's quickly listen to this snippetnof an opera singer warming up.,Here it is. 
 (Singing) 
 (Singing ends) 
 It's beautiful, isn't it?,Gotcha!,That is actually not the soundnof an opera singer warming up.,That is the sound of a bird,slowed down to a pace,that the human ear mistakenlynrecognizes as its own.,It was released as part of Peter Szöke'sn1987 Hungarian recording,"The Unknown Music of Birds,",where he records many birdsnand slows down their pitches,to reveal what's underneath.,Let's listen to the full-speed recording. 
 (Bird singing) 
 Now, let's hear the two of them together,so your brain can juxtapose them. 
 (Bird singing at slow then full speed) 
 (Singing ends) 
 It's incredible.,Perhaps the techniques of opera singingnwere inspired by birdsong.,As humans, we intuitively understand birdsnto be our musical teachers. 
 In Ethiopia, birdsnare considered an integral part,of the origin of music itself.,The story goes like this:,1,500 years ago, a young mannwas born in the Empire of Aksum,,a major trading centernof the ancient world.,His name was Yared.,When Yared was seven years oldnhis father died,,and his mother sent him to go livenwith an uncle, who was a priest,of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,,one of the oldest churches in the world.,Now, this tradition has an enormous amountnof scholarship and learning,,and Yared had to study and studynand study and study,,and one day he was studying under a tree,,when three birds came to him.,One by one, these birdsnbecame his teachers.,They taught him music -- scales, in fact.,And Yared, eventuallynrecognized as Saint Yared,,used these scales to composenfive volumes of chants and hymns,for worship and celebration.,And he used these scalesnto compose and to create,an indigenous musical notation system.,And these scales evolvedninto what is known as kiñit,,the unique, pentatonic, five-note,nmodal system that is very much alive,and thriving and still evolvingnin Ethiopia today. 
 Now, I love this story becausenit's true at multiple levels.,Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,,and the natural worldncan be our musical teacher.,And we have so many examples of this:,the Pygmies of the Congontune their instruments,to the pitches of the birdsnin the forest around them.,Musician and natural soundscapenexpert Bernie Krause describes,how a healthy environmentnhas animals and insects,taking up low, mediumnand high-frequency bands,,in exactly the same waynas a symphony does.,And countless works of musicnwere inspired by bird and forest song.,Yes, the natural worldncan be our cultural teacher. 
 So let's go now to the uniquelynhuman world of language.,Every language communicatesnwith pitch to varying degrees,,whether it's Mandarin Chinese,,where a shift in melodic inflectionngives the same phonetic syllable,an entirely different meaning,,to a language like English,,where a raised pitchnat the end of a sentence ...,(Going up in pitch) implies a question? 
 (Laughter) 
 As an Ethiopian-American woman,,I grew up around the languagenof Amharic, Amhariña.,It was my first language,nthe language of my parents,,one of the main languages of Ethiopia.,And there are a million reasonsnto fall in love with this language:,its depth of poetics,nits double entendres,,its wax and gold, its humor,,its proverbs that illuminatenthe wisdom and follies of life.,But there's also this melodicism,na musicality built right in.,And I find this distilled most clearly,in what I like to callnemphatic language --,language that's meantnto highlight or underline,or that springs from surprise.,Take, for example, the word: "indey.",Now, if there are Ethiopiansnin the audience,,they're probably chuckling to themselves,,because the word meansnsomething like "No!",or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't.",It kind of depends on the situation.,But when I was a kid,nthis was my very favorite word,,and I think it's because it has a pitch.,It has a melody.,You can almost see the shapenas it springs from someone's mouth.,"Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again.,And as a musician and composer,nwhen I hear that word,,something like thisnis floating through my mind. 
 (Music and singing "Indey") 
 (Music ends) 
 Or take, for example, the phrasenfor "It is right" or "It is correct" --,"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu.",It's an affirmation, an agreement.,"Lickih nehu.",When I hear that phrase,,something like this starts rollingnthrough my mind. 
 (Music and singing "Lickih nehu") 
 (Music ends) 
 And in both of those cases,nwhat I did was I took the melody,and the phrasingnof those words and phrases,and I turned them into musical partsnto use in these short compositions.,And I like to write bass lines,,so they both ended upnkind of as bass lines. 
 Now, this is based on the worknof Jason Moran and others,who work intimatelynwith music and language,,but it's also something I've hadnin my head since I was a kid,,how musical my parents sounded,when they were speakingnto each other and to us.,It was from themnand from Amhariña that I learned,that we are awash in musical expression,with every word,nevery sentence that we speak,,every word, every sentencenthat we receive.,Perhaps you can hear itnin the words I'm speaking even now. 
 Finally, we go to the 1950s United States,and the most seminal worknof 20th century avant-garde composition:,John Cage's "4:33,",written for any instrumentnor combination of instruments.,The musician or musicians are invitednto walk onto the stage,with a stopwatch and open the score,,which was actually purchasednby the Museum of Modern Art --,the score, that is.,And this score has notna single note written,and there is not a single note played,for four minutes and 33 seconds.,And, at once enraging and enrapturing,,Cage shows us that evennwhen there are no strings,being plucked by fingersnor hands hammering piano keys,,still there is music,nstill there is music,,still there is music.,And what is this music?,It was that sneeze in the back. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is the everyday soundscapenthat arises from the audience themselves:,their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,ntheir whispers, their sneezes,,the room, the woodnof the floors and the walls,expanding and contracting,ncreaking and groaning,with the heat and the cold,,the pipes clanking and contributing.,And controversial though it was,nand even controversial though it remains,,Cage's point is that there is nonsuch thing as true silence.,Even in the most silent environments,nwe still hear and feel the sound,of our own heartbeats.,The world is alivenwith musical expression.,We are already immersed. 
 Now, I had my own moment of,nlet's say, remixing John Cage,a couple of months ago,when I was standingnin front of the stove cooking lentils.,And it was late one nightnand it was time to stir,,so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,,and I placed it ontonthe kitchen counter next to me,,and it started to roll back and forth,making this sound. 
 (Sound of metal lidnclanking against a counter) 
 (Clanking ends) 
 And it stopped me cold.,I thought, "What a weird, cool swingnthat cooking pan lid has.",So when the lentils were ready and eaten,,I hightailed it to my backyard studio,,and I made this. 
 (Music, including the soundnof the lid, and singing) 
 (Music ends) 
 Now, John Cagenwasn't instructing musicians,to mine the soundscapenfor sonic textures to turn into music.,He was saying that on its own,,the environment is musically generative,,that it is generous, that it is fertile,,that we are already immersed. 
 Musician, music researcher, surgeonnand human hearing expert Charles Limb,is a professor at Johns Hopkins University,and he studies music and the brain.,And he has a theory,that it is possible -- it is possible --,that the human auditory systemnactually evolved to hear music,,because it is so much more complexnthan it needs to be for language alone.,And if that's true,,it means that we're hard-wired for music,,that we can find it anywhere,,that there is no such thingnas a musical desert,,that we are permanentlynhanging out at the oasis,,and that is marvelous.,We can add to the soundtrack,nbut it's already playing. 
 And it doesn't mean don't study music.,Study music, trace your sonic lineagesnand enjoy that exploration.,But there is a kind of sonic lineagento which we all belong.,So the next time you are seekingnpercussion inspiration,,look no further than your tires,nas they roll over the unusual grooves,of the freeway,,or the top-right burner of your stove,and that strange way that it clicks,as it is preparing to light.,When seeking melodic inspiration,,look no further than dawnnand dusk avian orchestras,or to the natural liltnof emphatic language.,We are the audiencenand we are the composers,and we take from these pieces,we are given.,We make, we make, we make, we make,,knowing that when it comes to naturenor language or soundscape,,there is no end to the inspiration --,if we are listening. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Father Daniel Berrigan once saidnthat "writing about prisoners,is a little like writing about the dead.",I think what he meant is thatnwe treat prisoners as ghosts.,They're unseen and unheard.,It's easy to simply ignore them,and it's even easier when the governmentngoes to great lengths to keep them hidden. 
 As a journalist, I think these stories,of what people in power donwhen no one is watching,,are precisely the storiesnthat we need to tell.,That's why I began investigating,the most secretive and experimentalnprison units in the United States,,for so-called "second-tier" terrorists.,The government calls these unitsnCommunications Management Units or CMUs.,Prisoners and guards call themn"Little Guantanamo.",They are islands unto themselves.,But unlike Gitmo they existnright here, at home,,floating within larger federal prisons. 
 There are 2 CMUs.,One was opened inside the prisonnin Terre Haute, Indiana,,and the other is inside this prison,nin Marion, Illinois.,Neither of them underwentnthe formal review process,that is required by lawnwhen they were opened.,CMU prisoners have allnbeen convicted of crimes.,Some of their cases are questionablenand some involve threats and violence.,I'm not here to argue the guiltnor innocence of any prisoner.,I'm here because as Supreme Court JusticenThurgood Marshall said,,"When the prisons and gates slam shut,,prisoners do not losentheir human quality." 
 Every prisoner I've interviewednhas said there are three flecks of light,in the darkness of prison:,phone calls,,letters,and visits from family.,CMUs aren't solitary confinement,nbut they radically restrict all of these,to levels that meet or exceed the mostnextreme prisons in the United States.,Their phone calls can be limitednto 45 minutes a month,,compared to the 300 minutesnother prisoners receive.,Their letters can be limitednto six pieces of paper.,Their visits can be limitednto four hours per month,,compared to the 35 hours that peoplenlike Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph,receive in the supermax.,On top of that, CMU visits are non-contactnwhich means prisoners are not allowed,to even hug their family.,As one CMU prisoner said,,"We're not being tortured here,nexcept psychologically." 
 The government won't saynwho is imprisoned here.,But through court documents,nopen records requests,and interviews with currentnand former prisoners,,some small windowsninto the CMUs have opened. 
 There's an estimatedn60 to 70 prisoners here,,and they're overwhelmingly Muslim.,They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,,who violated the economic sanctionsnon Iraq by sending medical supplies,for the children there.,They've included people like Yassin Aref.,Aref and his family fled to New Yorknfrom Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.,He was arrested in 2004nas part of an FBI sting.,Aref is an imam and he was askednto bear witness to a loan,,which is a tradition in Islamic culture.,It turned out that one of the peopleninvolved in the loan was trying to enlist,someone else in a fake attack.,Aref didn't know.,For that, he was convicted,of conspiracy to provide material supportnto a terrorist group. 
 The CMUs also includensome non-Muslim prisoners.,The guards call them "balancers,",meaning they help balance outnthe racial numbers,,in hopes of deflecting law suits.,These balancers include animal rightsnand environmental activists,like Daniel McGowan. 
 McGowan was convictednof participating in two arsons,in the name of defending the environment,as part of the Earth Liberation Front.,During his sentencing, he was afraidnthat he would be sent,to a rumored secret prison for terrorists.,The judge dismissed all those fears,,saying that theynweren't supported by any facts.,But that might be because the governmentnhasn't fully explained,why some prisoners end up in a CMU,,and who is responsiblenfor these decisions.,When McGowan was transferred, he was told,it's because he is a "domestic terrorist,",a term the FBI uses repeatedly whenntalking about environmental activists.,Now, keep in mind there are about 400nprisoners in US prisons,who are classified as terrorists,,and only a handful of themnare in the CMUs.,In McGowan's case, he was previouslynat a low-security prison,and he had no communications violations. 
 So, why was he moved?,Like other CMU prisoners,,McGowan repeatedly askednfor an answer, a hearing,,or some opportunity for an appeal.,This example from another prisonernshows how those requests are viewed.,"Wants a transfer." "Told him no.",At one point, the prison warden himselfnrecommended McGowan's transfer,out of the CMU citing his good behavior,,but the warden was overruled,by the Bureau of Prison'snCounterterrorism Unit,,working with the Joint TerrorismnTask Force of the FBI. 
 Later I found out that McGowannwas really sent to a CMU,not because of what he did,,but what he has said.,A memo from the Counterterrorism Unitncited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs.",While imprisoned, he continued writingnabout environmental issues,,saying that activists mustnreflect on their mistakes,and listen to each other.,Now, in fairness, if you've spentnany time at all in Washington, DC,,you know this is really a radicalnconcept for the government. 
 (Laughter) 
 I actually asked to visitnMcGowan in the CMU.,And I was approved.,That came as quite a shock.,First, because as I've discussednon this stage before,,I learned that the FBI has beennmonitoring my work.,Second, because it would make me the firstnand only journalist to visit a CMU.,I had even learned,through the Bureau of PrisonsnCounterterrorism Unit,,that they had been monitoring my speechesnabout CMUs, like this one.,So how could I possiblynbe approved to visit?,A few days before I wentnout to the prison, I got an answer. 
 I was allowed to visit McGowannas a friend, not a journalist.,Journalists are not allowed here.,McGowan was told by CMU officialsnthat if I asked any questions,or published any story,,that he would be punishednfor my reporting.,When I arrived for our visit,nthe guards reminded me,that they knew who I wasnand knew about my work.,And they said that if I attemptednto interview McGowan,,the visit would be terminated.,The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUsnas "self-contained housing units.",But I think that's an Orwellian waynof describing black holes.,When you visit a CMU,,you go through all the securityncheckpoints that you would expect.,But then the walknto the visitation room is silent.,When a CMU prisoner has a visit,nthe rest of the prison is on lockdown.,I was ushered into a small room,,so small my outstretched armsncould touch each wall.,There was a grapefruit-sizednorb in the ceiling,for the visit to be live-monitorednby the Counterterrorism Unit,in West Virginia.,The unit insists that all the visitsnhave to be in English for CMU prisoners,,which is an additional hardshipnfor many of the Muslim families.,There is a thick sheet of foggy,nbulletproof glass,and on the other side was Daniel McGowan.,We spoke through these handsetsnattached to the wall,and talked about books and movies.,We did our best to find reasons to laugh.,To fight boredom and amuse himselfnwhile in the CMU,,McGowan had been spreading a rumornthat I was secretly the president,of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC 
 (Laughter) 
 For the record, I'm not. 
 (Laughter),But I kind of the hope the FBInnow thinks that Bella and Edward,are terrorist code names. 
 (Laughter) 
 During our visit, McGowan spoke mostnand at length about his niece Lily,,his wife Jenny and how torturousnit feels to never be able to hug them,,to never be able to hold their hands.,Three months after our visit, McGowannwas transferred out of the CMU,and then, without warning,nhe was sent back again.,I had published leakednCMU documents on my website,and the Counterterrorism Unit saidnthat McGowan had called his wife,and asked her to mail them.,He wanted to see what the governmentnwas saying about him,,and for that he was sent back to the CMU.,When he was finally releasednat the end of his sentence,,his story got even more Kafkaesque.,He wrote an articlenfor the Huffington Post headlined,,"Court Documents Prove I was Sent tona CMU for my Political Speech." 
 The next day he was thrownnback in jail for his political speech.,His attorneys quickly secured his release,,but the message was very clear:,Don't talk about this place. 
 Today, nine years after they were openednby the Bush administration,,the government is codifyingnhow and why CMUs were created.,According to the Bureau of Prisons,,they are for prisonersnwith "inspirational significance.",I think that is very nice way of sayingnthese are political prisons,for political prisoners. 
 Prisoners are sent to a CMUnbecause of their race,,their religion or theirnpolitical beliefs. 
 Now, if you think thatncharacterization is too strong,,just look at somenof the government's own documents.,When some of McGowan's mail was rejectednby the CMU, the sender was told,it's because the letters were intendedn"for political prisoners.",When another prisoner, animal rightsnactivist Andy Stepanian,,was sent to a CMU, it was because of hisnanti-government and anti-corporate views. 
 Now, I know all of thisnmay be hard to believe,,that it's happening right now,nand in the United States.,But the unknown realitynis that the US has a dark history,of disproportionately punishing peoplenbecause of their political beliefs.,In the 1960s, before Marionnwas home to the CMU,,it was home to the notorious Control Unit.,Prisoners were locked downnin solitary for 22 hours a day.,The warden said the unitnwas to "control revolutionary attitudes.",In the 1980s, another experiment callednthe Lexington High Security Unit,held women connectednto the Weather Underground,,Black Liberation and Puerto Ricannindependent struggles.,The prison radically restrictedncommunication and used sleep deprivation,,and constant light for so-calledn"ideological conversion.",Those prisons were eventually shut down,nbut only through the campaigning,of religious groups and human rightsnadvocates, like Amnesty International. 
 Today, civil rights lawyersnwith the Center for Constitutional Rights,are challenging CMUs in court,for depriving prisonersnof their due process rights,and for retaliating against them,for their protected politicalnand religious speech.,Many of these documents would havennever come to light without this lawsuit. 
 The message of these groupsnand my message for you today,is that we must bear witnessnto what is being done to these prisoners.,Their treatment is a reflectionnof the values held beyond prison walls.,This story is not just about prisoners.,It is about us.,It is about our own commitmentnto human rights.,It is about whether we will choose to stopnrepeating the mistakes of our past.,If we don't listen to what Father Berriganndescribed as the stories of the dead,,they will soon becomenthe stories of ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions.,When I was in high school,nI learned about the Bill of Rights,,the Constitution, freedom of speech,,due process and nabout 25 other laws and rights,that seem to be violated by this.,How could this possibly be happening? 
 Will Potter: I think that'snthe number one question I get,throughout all of my work,,and the short answer isnthat people don't know.,I think the solution to any of these typesnof situations, any rights abuses,,are really dependent on two things.,They're dependent on knowledgenthat it's actually happening,and then a means and efficacynto actually make a change.,And unfortunately with these prisoners,,one, people don't knownwhat's happening at all,and then they're alreadyndisenfranchised populations,who don't have access to attorneys,nnot native English speakers.,In some of these cases, they have greatnrepresentation that I mentioned,,but there's just not a public awarenessnof what's happening. 
 TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prisonnthat you have right to council,or access to council? 
 WP: There's a tendency in our culture,to see when people have beennconvicted of a crime,,no matter if that chargenwas bogus or legitimate,,that whatever happens to themnafter that is warranted.,And I think that's a really damagingnand dangerous narrative that we have,,that allows these typesnof things to happen,,as the general public justnkind of turns a blind eye to it. 
 TR: All those documents on screennwere all real documents, word for word,,unchanged at all, right? 
 WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploadednall of them to my website.,It's willpotter.com/CMU and it'sna footnoted version of the talk,,so you can see the documents for yourselfnwithout the little snippets.,You can see the full version.,I relied overwhelminglynon primary source documents,or on primary interviewsnwith former and current prisoners,,with people that are dealingnwith this situation every day.,And like I said, I've beennthere myself, as well. 
 TR: You're doing courageous work. 
 WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all. 
 (Applause)Imagine being unable to say,n"I am hungry," "I am in pain,","thank you," or "I love you.",Being trapped inside your body,,a body that doesn't respond to commands.,Surrounded by people,,yet utterly alone.,Wishing you could reach out,,to connect, to comfort, to participate.,For 13 long years, that was my reality. 
 Most of us never think twicenabout talking, about communicating.,I've thought a lot about it.,I've had a lot of time to think. 
 For the first 12 years of my life,,I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.,Then everything changed.,I contracted a brain infection.,The doctors weren't sure what it was,,but they treated me the best they could.,However, I progressively got worse.,Eventually, I lost my abilitynto control my movements,,make eye contact,,and finally, my ability to speak. 
 While in hospital,,I desperately wanted to go home.,I said to my mother, "When home?",Those were the last wordsnI ever spoke with my own voice.,I would eventually fail every testnfor mental awareness.,My parents were toldnI was as good as not there.,A vegetable, having the intelligencenof a three-month-old baby.,They were told to take me homenand try to keep me comfortable,until I died. 
 My parents, in factnmy entire family's lives,,became consumed by taking care of menthe best they knew how.,Their friends drifted away.,One year turned to two,,two turned to three.,It seemed like the person I once wasnbegan to disappear.,The Lego blocks and electronic circuitsnI'd loved as a boy were put away.,I had been moved out of my bedroomninto another more practical one.,I had become a ghost,,a faded memory of a boynpeople once knew and loved. 
 Meanwhile, my mind begannknitting itself back together.,Gradually, my awareness started to return.,But no one realizednthat I had come back to life.,I was aware of everything,,just like any normal person.,I could see and understand everything,,but I couldn't find a waynto let anybody know.,My personality was entombednwithin a seemingly silent body,,a vibrant mind hidden in plain sightnwithin a chrysalis. 
 The stark reality hit menthat I was going to spend,the rest of my life locked inside myself,,totally alone.,I was trapped with onlynmy thoughts for company.,I would never be rescued.,No one would ever show me tenderness.,I would never talk to a friend.,No one would ever love me.,I had no dreams, no hope,nnothing to look forward to.,Well, nothing pleasant.,I lived in fear,,and, to put it bluntly,,was waiting for deathnto finally release me,,expecting to die all alone in a care home. 
 I don't know if it's truly possiblento express in words,what it's like not to be ablento communicate.,Your personality appearsnto vanish into a heavy fog,and all of your emotions and desires arenconstricted, stifled and muted within you.,For me, the worst was the feelingnof utter powerlessness.,I simply existed.,It's a very dark place to find yourself,because in a sense, you have vanished.,Other people controllednevery aspect of my life.,They decided what I ate and when.,Whether I was laid on my sidenor strapped into my wheelchair.,I often spent my daysnpositioned in front of the TV,watching Barney reruns.,I think because Barneynis so happy and jolly,,and I absolutely wasn't,,it made it so much worse. 
 I was completely powerlessnto change anything in my life,or people's perceptions of me.,I was a silent, invisible observernof how people behaved,when they thought no one was watching.,Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.,With no way to communicate,nI became the perfect victim:,a defenseless object,nseemingly devoid of feelings,that people usednto play out their darkest desires.,For more than 10 years,npeople who were charged with my care,abused me physically,nverbally and sexually.,Despite what they thought, I did feel.,The first time it happened,,I was shocked and filled with disbelief.,How could they do this to me?,I was confused.,What had I done to deserve this?,Part of me wanted to crynand another part wanted to fight.,Hurt, sadness and angernflooded through me.,I felt worthless.,There was no one to comfort me.,But neither of my parentsnknew this was happening.,I lived in terror, knowingnit would happen again and again.,I just never knew when.,All I knew was that I wouldnnever be the same.,I remember once listeningnto Whitney Houston singing,,"No matter what they take from me,nthey can't take away my dignity.",And I thought to myself,n"You want to bet?" 
 Perhaps my parents could havenfound out and could have helped.,But the years of constant caretaking,,having to wake upnevery two hours to turn me,,combined with them essentiallyngrieving the loss of their son,,had taken a toll on my mother and father.,Following yet another heated argumentnbetween my parents,,in a moment of despair and desperation,,my mother turned to menand told me that I should die.,I was shocked, but as I thoughtnabout what she had said,,I was filled with enormous compassionnand love for my mother,,yet I could do nothing about it. 
 There were many moments when I gave up,,sinking into a dark abyss.,I remember one particularly low moment.,My dad left me alone in the car,while he quickly wentnto buy something from the store.,A random stranger walked past,,looked at me and he smiled.,I may never know why, but that simple act,,the fleeting moment of human connection,,transformed how I was feeling,,making me want to keep going. 
 My existence was tortured by monotony,,a reality that was often too much to bear.,Alone with my thoughts,nI constructed intricate fantasies,about ants running across the floor.,I taught myself to tell the timenby noticing where the shadows were.,As I learned how the shadows movednas the hours of the day passed,,I understood how long it would benbefore I was picked up and taken home.,Seeing my father walknthrough the door to collect me,was the best moment of the day. 
 My mind became a tool that I could use,to either close downnto retreat from my reality,or enlarge into a gigantic spacenthat I could fill with fantasies.,I hoped that my reality would change,and someone would seenthat I had come back to life.,But I had been washed awaynlike a sand castle,built too close to the waves,,and in my place was the personnpeople expected me to be.,To some I was Martin,na vacant shell, the vegetable,,deserving of harsh words,ndismissal and even abuse.,To others, I was the tragicallynbrain-damaged boy,who had grown to become a man.,Someone they were kind to and cared for.,Good or bad, I was a blank canvas,onto which different versionsnof myself were projected. 
 It took someone newnto see me in a different way.,An aromatherapist began comingnto the care home about once a week.,Whether through intuitionnor her attention to details,that others failed to notice,,she became convinced that I couldnunderstand what was being said.,She urged my parentsnto have me tested by experts,in augmentativenand alternative communication.,And within a year,,I was beginning to usena computer program to communicate.,It was exhilarating,nbut frustrating at times.,I had so many words in my mind,,that I couldn't waitnto be able to share them.,Sometimes, I would say things to myselfnsimply because I could.,In myself, I had a ready audience,,and I believed that by expressingnmy thoughts and wishes,,others would listen, too. 
 But as I began to communicate more,,I realized that it was in factnonly just the beginning,of creating a new voice for myself.,I was thrust into a worldnI didn't quite know how to function in.,I stopped going to the care home,and managed to get my first jobnmaking photocopies.,As simple as this may sound,nit was amazing.,My new world was really exciting,but often quite overwhelmingnand frightening.,I was like a man-child,,and as liberating as it often was,,I struggled.,I also learned that many of thosenwho had known me for a long time,found it impossible to abandon the ideanof Martin they had in their heads.,While those I had only just met,struggled to look past the imagenof a silent man in a wheelchair.,I realized that some peoplenwould only listen to me,if what I said was in linenwith what they expected.,Otherwise, it was disregarded,and they did what they felt was best. 
 I discovered that true communication,is about more than merelynphysically conveying a message.,It is about getting the messagenheard and respected.,Still, things were going well.,My body was slowly getting stronger.,I had a job in computing that I loved,,and had even got Kojak, the dognI had been dreaming about for years. 
 However, I longed to sharenmy life with someone.,I remember staring out the windownas my dad drove me home from work,,thinking I have so much love inside of menand nobody to give it to.,Just as I had resigned myselfnto being single for the rest of my life,,I met Joan.,Not only is she the best thingnthat has ever happened to me,,but Joan helped me to challengenmy own misconceptions about myself.,Joan said it was through my wordsnthat she fell in love with me.,However, after all I had been through,,I still couldn't shake the belief,that nobody could truly seenbeyond my disability,and accept me for who I am. 
 I also really strugglednto comprehend that I was a man.,The first time someonenreferred to me as a man,,it stopped me in my tracks.,I felt like looking aroundnand asking, "Who, me?",That all changed with Joan.,We have an amazing connection,and I learned how important it isnto communicate openly and honestly.,I felt safe, and it gave me the confidencento truly say what I thought.,I started to feel whole again,na man worthy of love. 
 I began to reshape my destiny.,I spoke up a little more at work.,I asserted my need for independencento the people around me.,Being given a means of communicationnchanged everything.,I used the power of words and willnto challenge the preconceptions,of those around menand those I had of myself. 
 Communication is what makes us human,,enabling us to connectnon the deepest level,with those around us --,telling our own stories,,expressing wants, needs and desires,,or hearing those of othersnby really listening.,All this is how the worldnknows who we are.,So who are we without it? 
 True communication increases understanding,and creates a more caringnand compassionate world.,Once, I was perceivednto be an inanimate object,,a mindless phantomnof a boy in a wheelchair.,Today, I am so much more.,A husband, a son, a friend,,a brother, a business owner,na first-class honors graduate,,a keen amateur photographer.,It is my ability to communicatenthat has given me all this. 
 We are told that actionsnspeak louder than words.,But I wonder,,do they?,Our words, however we communicate them,,are just as powerful.,Whether we speak the wordsnwith our own voices,,type them with our eyes,,or communicate them non-verballynto someone who speaks them for us,,words are among our most powerful tools. 
 I have come to you throughna terrible darkness,,pulled from it by caring souls,and by language itself.,The act of you listening to me todaynbrings me farther into the light.,We are shining here together.,If there is one most difficult obstaclento my way of communicating,,it is that sometimes I want to shout,and other times simply to whisperna word of love or gratitude.,It all sounds the same.,But if you will,,please imagine these next two wordsnas warmly as you can: 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Your company launchesna search for an open position.,The applications start rolling in,,and the qualified candidatesnare identified.,Now the choosing begins.,Person A: Ivy League,n4.0, flawless resume,,great recommendations.,All the right stuff.,Person B: state school,nfair amount of job hopping,,and odd jobs like cashiernand singing waitress.,But remember -- both are qualified.,So I ask you:,who are you going to pick? 
 My colleagues and I creatednvery official terms,to describe two distinctncategories of candidates.,We call A "the Silver Spoon,",the one who clearly had advantagesnand was destined for success.,And we call B "the Scrapper,",the one who had to fightnagainst tremendous odds,to get to the same point.,You just heard a human resourcesndirector refer to people,as Silver Spoons and Scrappers -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is not exactly politically correctnand sounds a bit judgmental.,But before my human resourcesncertification gets revoked -- 
 (Laughter) 
 let me explain. 
 A resume tells a story.,And over the years, I've learnednsomething about people,whose experiences readnlike a patchwork quilt,,that makes me stop and fully consider them,before tossing their resumes away.,A series of odd jobs may indicate,inconsistency, lack of focus,nunpredictability.,Or it may signal a committednstruggle against obstacles.,At the very least, the Scrapperndeserves an interview. 
 To be clear,,I don't hold anythingnagainst the Silver Spoon;,getting into and graduatingnfrom an elite university,takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.,But if your whole life has beennengineered toward success,,how will you handle the tough times?,One person I hired felt thatnbecause he attended an elite university,,there were certain assignmentsnthat were beneath him,,like temporarily doing manual labornto better understand an operation.,Eventually, he quit.,But on the flip side,,what happens when your whole lifenis destined for failure,and you actually succeed? 
 I want to urge younto interview the Scrapper.,I know a lot about thisnbecause I am a Scrapper.,Before I was born,,my father was diagnosednwith paranoid schizophrenia,,and he couldn't hold a jobnin spite of his brilliance.,Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,",one part "Awakenings",and one part "A Beautiful Mind." 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm the fourth of five childrennraised by a single mother,in a rough neighborhoodnin Brooklyn, New York.,We never owned a home,na car, a washing machine,,and for most of my childhood,nwe didn't even have a telephone.,So I was highly motivated,to understand the relationshipnbetween business success and Scrappers,,because my life could easilynhave turned out very differently.,As I met successful business people,and read profiles of high-powered leaders,,I noticed some commonality. 
 Many of them had experiencednearly hardships,,anywhere from poverty, abandonment,,death of a parent while young,,to learning disabilities,nalcoholism and violence.,The conventional thinking has beennthat trauma leads to distress,,and there's been a lot of focusnon the resulting dysfunction.,But during studies of dysfunction,ndata revealed an unexpected insight:,that even the worst circumstancesncan result in growth and transformation.,A remarkable and counterintuitivenphenomenon has been discovered,,which scientists callnPost Traumatic Growth. 
 In one study designed to measurenthe effects of adversity,on children at risk,,among a subset of 698 children,who experienced the most severenand extreme conditions,,fully one-third grew up to lead healthy,nsuccessful and productive lives.,In spite of everything and againstntremendous odds, they succeeded.,One-third. 
 Take this resume.,This guy's parentsngive him up for adoption.,He never finishes college.,He job-hops quite a bit,,goes on a sojourn to India for a year,,and to top it off, he has dyslexia.,Would you hire this guy?,His name is Steve Jobs. 
 In a study of the world'snmost highly successful entrepreneurs,,it turns out a disproportionatennumber have dyslexia.,In the US,,35 percent of the entrepreneursnstudied had dyslexia.,What's remarkable --namong those entrepreneurs,who experience post traumatic growth,,they now view their learning disability,as a desirable difficultynwhich provided them an advantage,because they became better listenersnand paid greater attention to detail.,They don't think they are who they arenin spite of adversity,,they know they are who they arenbecause of adversity.,They embrace their trauma and hardships,as key elements of who they've become,,and know that without those experiences,,they might not have developednthe muscle and grit required,to become successful. 
 One of my colleaguesnhad his life completely upended,as a result of the ChinesenCultural Revolution in 1966.,At age 13, his parents were relocatednto the countryside,,the schools were closed,and he was left alone in Beijingnto fend for himself until 16,,when he got a job in a clothing factory.,But instead of accepting his fate,,he made a resolution that he wouldncontinue his formal education.,Eleven years later, whennthe political landscape changed,,he heard about a highly selectivenuniversity admissions test.,He had three months to learnnthe entire curriculum,of middle and high school.,So, every day he came homenfrom the factory,,took a nap, studied until 4am,nwent back to work,and repeated this cyclenevery day for three months.,He did it, he succeeded.,His commitment to his educationnwas unwavering, and he never lost hope.,Today, he holds a master's degree,,and his daughters each have degreesnfrom Cornell and Harvard. 
 Scrappers are propelled by the belief,that the only person you havenfull control over is yourself.,When things don't turn out well,,Scrappers ask, "What can I do differentlynto create a better result?",Scrappers have a sense of purpose,that prevents themnfrom giving up on themselves,,kind of like if you've survived poverty,na crazy father and several muggings,,you figure, "Business challenges? -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Really?,Piece of cake. I got this." 
 (Laughter) 
 And that reminds me -- humor.,Scrappers know that humorngets you through the tough times,,and laughter helps younchange your perspective. 
 And finally, there are relationships.,People who overcome adversityndon't do it alone.,Somewhere along the way,,they find people whonbring out the best in them,and who are invested in their success.,Having someone you canncount on no matter what,is essential to overcoming adversity.,I was lucky.,In my first job after college,,I didn't have a car, so I carpoolednacross two bridges,with a woman who wasnthe president's assistant.,She watched me work,and encouraged me to focus on my future,and not dwell on my past.,Along the way I've met many people,who've provided menbrutally honest feedback,,advice and mentorship.,These people don't mind,that I once worked as a singing waitressnto help pay for college. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll leave you with one final,nvaluable insight.,Companies that are committednto diversity and inclusive practices,tend to support Scrappers,and outperform their peers.,According to DiversityInc,,a study of their top 50ncompanies for diversity,outperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent. 
 So back to my original question.,Who are you going to bet on:,Silver Spoon or Scrapper?,I say choose the underestimated contender,,whose secret weaponsnare passion and purpose. 
 Hire the Scrapper. 
 (Applause)Our grandparents' generationncreated an amazing system,of canals and reservoirsnthat made it possible,for people to live in placesnwhere there wasn't a lot of water.,For example, during the Great Depression,,they created the Hoover Dam,,which in turn, created Lake Mead,and made it possible for the citiesnof Las Vegas and Phoenix,and Los Angeles to provide water,for people who livednin a really dry place. 
 In the 20th century,nwe literally spent trillions of dollars,building infrastructurento get water to our cities.,In terms of economic development,nit was a great investment.,But in the last decade,nwe've seen the combined effects,of climate change, population growthnand competition for water resources,threaten these vital lifelinesnand water resources. 
 This figure shows you the changenin the lake level of Lake Mead,that happened in the last 15 years.,You can see starting around the year 2000,,the lake level started to drop.,And it was dropping at such a rate,that it would have left the drinking waternintakes for Las Vegas high and dry.,The city became so concerned about this,that they recently constructedna new drinking water intake structure,that they referred to as the "Third Straw",to pull water outnof the greater depths of the lake. 
 The challenges associatednwith providing water to a modern city,are not restrictednto the American Southwest.,In the year 2007, the third largestncity in Australia, Brisbane,,came within 6 monthsnof running out of water.,A similar drama is playing out todaynin São Paulo, Brazil,,where the main reservoir for the city,has gone from beingncompletely full in 2010,,to being nearly empty today,as the city approachesnthe 2016 Summer Olympics. 
 For those of us who are fortunate enough,to live in onenof the world's great cities,,we've never truly experiencednthe effects of a catastrophic drought.,We like to complainnabout the navy showers we have to take.,We like our neighbors to seenour dirty cars and our brown lawns.,But we've never really facednthe prospect of turning on the tap,and having nothing come out.,And that's because when thingsnhave gotten bad in the past,,it's always been possiblento expand a reservoir,or dig a few more groundwater wells.,Well, in a time when allnof the water resources are spoken for,,it's not going to be possiblento rely on this tried and true way,of providing ourselves with water. 
 Some people think that we're goingnto solve the urban water problem,by taking water from our rural neighbors.,But that's an approach that's fraughtnwith political, legal and social dangers.,And even if we succeed in grabbingnthe water from our rural neighbors,,we're just transferringnthe problem to someone else,and there's a good chancenit will come back and bite us,in the form of higher food prices,and damage to the aquatic ecosystemsnthat already rely upon that water. 
 I think that there's a better waynto solve our urban water crisis,and I think that's to open upnfour new local sources of water,that I liken to faucets.,If we can make smart investmentsnin these new sources of water,in the coming years,,we can solve our urban water problem,and decrease the likelihoodnthat we'll ever run across,the effects of a catastrophic drought. 
 Now, if you told me 20 years ago,that a modern city could existnwithout a supply of imported water,,I probably would have dismissed younas an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.,But my own experiences,working with some of the world's mostnwater-starved cities in the last decades,have shown me that we haventhe technologies and the management skills,to actually transition awaynfrom imported water,,and that's what I wantnto tell you about tonight. 
 The first source of local waternsupply that we need to develop,to solve our urban water problem,will flow with the rainwaternthat falls in our cities.,One of the great tragediesnof urban development,is that as our cities grew,,we started covering all the surfacesnwith concrete and asphalt.,And when we did that,nwe had to build storm sewers,to get the waternthat fell on the cities out,before it could cause flooding,,and that's a wastenof a vital water resource.,Let me give you an example. 
 This figure here shows younthe volume of water,that could be collectednin the city of San Jose,if they could harvest the stormwaternthat fell within the city limits.,You can see from the intersectionnof the blue line and the black dotted line,that if San Jose could just capture halfnof the water that fell within the city,,they'd have enough waternto get them through an entire year. 
 Now, I know what some of younare probably thinking.,"The answer to our problemnis to start building great big tanks,and attaching themnto the downspouts of our roof gutters,,rainwater harvesting.",Now, that's an ideanthat might work in some places.,But if you live in a placenwhere it mainly rains in the winter time,and most of the water demandnis in the summertime,,it's not a very cost-effective waynto solve a water problem.,And if you experience the effectsnof a multiyear drought,,like California's currently experiencing,,you just can't build a rainwater tanknthat's big enough to solve your problem. 
 I think there's a lot more practical way,to harvest the stormwater andnthe rainwater that falls in our cities,,and that's to capture itnand let it percolate into the ground.,After all, many of our cities are sittingnon top of a natural water storage system,that can accommodatenhuge volumes of water. 
 For example, historically,nLos Angeles has obtained,about a third of its water supplynfrom a massive aquifer,that underlies the San Fernando Valley.,Now, when you look at the waternthat comes off of your roof,and runs off of your lawnnand flows down the gutter,,you might say to yourself,n"Do I really want to drink that stuff?",Well, the answer isnyou don't want to drink it,until it's been treated a little bit.,And so the challenge that we facenin urban water harvesting,is to capture the water, clean the water,and get it underground. 
 And that's exactlynwhat the city of Los Angeles is doing,with a new project that they're buildingnin Burbank, California.,This figure here showsnthe stormwater park that they're building,by hooking a series of stormwaterncollection systems, or storm sewers,,and routing that waterninto an abandoned gravel quarry.,The water that's captured in the quarry,is slowly passednthrough a man-made wetland,,and then it goesninto that ball field there,and percolates into the ground,,recharging the drinking waternaquifer of the city. 
 And in the processnof passing through the wetland,and percolating through the ground,,the water encounters microbesnthat live on the surfaces of the plants,and the surfaces of the soil,,and that purifies the water.,And if the water'snstill not clean enough to drink,after it's been throughnthis natural treatment process,,the city can treat it again,when they pump if back outnof the groundwater aquifers,before they deliver it to people to drink. 
 The second tap that we need to open upnto solve our urban water problem,will flow with the wastewater,that comes outnof our sewage treatment plants.,Now, many of you are probably familiarnwith the concept of recycled water.,You've probably seen signs like this,that tell you that the shrubberynand the highway median,and the local golf course,is being watered with water,that used to benin a sewage treatment plant.,We've been doing thisnfor a couple of decades now.,But what we're learningnfrom our experience,is that this approach is much morenexpensive that we expected it to be.,Because once we buildnthe first few water recycling systems,close to the sewage treatment plant,,we have to build longernand longer pipe networks,to get that water to where it needs to go.,And that becomes prohibitivenin terms of cost. 
 What we're finding is,that a much more cost-effectivenand practical way of recycling wastewater,is to turn treated wastewaterninto drinking water,through a two-step process.,In the first step in this processnwe pressurize the water,and pass it throughna reverse osmosis membrane:,a thin, permeable plastic membrane,that allows water moleculesnto pass through,but traps and retains the salts,nthe viruses and the organic chemicals,that might be present in the wastewater. 
 In the second step in the process,,we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide,and shine ultraviolet light on the water.,The ultraviolet lightncleaves the hydrogen peroxide,into two parts that are callednhydroxyl radicals,,and these hydroxyl radicalsnare very potent forms of oxygen,that break down most organic chemicals. 
 After the water's beennthrough this two-stage process,,it's safe to drink.,I know,,I've been studying recycled water,using every measurement techniquenknown to modern science,for the past 15 years.,We've detected some chemicals,that can make it throughnthe first step in the process,,but by the time we get to the second step,,the advanced oxidation process,,we rarely see any chemicals present.,And that's in stark contrastnto the taken-for-granted water supplies,that we regularly drink all the time. 
 There's another way we can recycle water.,This is an engineered treatment wetlandnthat we recently built,on the Santa Ana Rivernin Southern California.,The treatment wetland receives waternfrom a part of the Santa Ana River,that in the summertime consistsnalmost entirely of wastewater effluent,from cities like Riversidenand San Bernardino.,The water comesninto our treatment wetland,,it's exposed to sunlight and algae,and those break downnthe organic chemicals,,remove the nutrientsnand inactivate the waterborne pathogens.,The water gets put backnin the Santa Ana River,,it flows down to Anaheim,,gets taken out at Anaheimnand percolated into the ground,,and becomes the drinking waternof the city of Anaheim,,completing the tripnfrom the sewers of Riverside County,to the drinking water supplynof Orange County. 
 Now, you might thinknthat this idea of drinking wastewater,is some sort of futuristic fantasynor not commonly done.,Well, in California, we already recyclenabout 40 billion gallons a year,of wastewater through the two-stagenadvanced treatment process,I was telling you about.,That's enough water to benthe supply of about a million people,if it were their sole water supply. 
 The third tap that we need to open upnwill not be a tap at all,,it will be a kind of virtual tap,,it will be the water conservationnthat we manage to do.,And the place where we need to thinknabout water conservation is outdoors,because in Californianand other modern American cities,,about half of our water usenhappens outdoors. 
 In the current drought,,we've seen that it's possible,to have our lawns survivenand our plants survive,with about half as much water.,So there's no neednto start painting concrete green,and putting in Astroturfnand buying cactuses.,We can have California-friendlynlandscaping with soil moisture detectors,and smart irrigation controllers,and have beautifulngreen landscapes in our cities. 
 The fourth and final water tapnthat we need to open up,to solve our urban water problem,will flow with desalinated seawater.,Now, I know what you probably heardnpeople say about seawater desalination.,"It's a great thing to do if you havenlots of oil, not a lot of water,and you don't care about climate change.",Seawater desalination is energy-intensivenno matter how you slice it.,But that characterizationnof seawater desalination,as being a nonstarternis hopelessly out of date.,We've made tremendous progressnin seawater desalination,in the past two decades. 
 This picture shows you,the largest seawater desalination plantnin the Western hemisphere,that's currently being builtnnorth of San Diego.,Compared to the seawaterndesalination plant,that was built innSanta Barbara 25 years ago,,this treatment plantnwill use about half the energy,to produce a gallon of water. 
 But just because seawater desalinationnhas become less energy-intensive,,doesn't mean we should start buildingndesalination plants everywhere.,Among the different choices we have,,it's probably the most energy-intensive,and potentially environmentally damaging,of the options to createna local water supply. 
 So there it is.,With these four sources of water,,we can move awaynfrom our reliance on imported water.,Through reform in the way we landscapenour surfaces and our properties,,we can reduce outdoor water usenby about 50 percent,,thereby increasing nthe water supply by 25 percent.,We can recycle the waternthat makes it into the sewer,,thereby increasingnour water supply by 40 percent.,And we can make up the differencenthrough a combination,of stormwater harvestingnand seawater desalination. 
 So, let's create a water supply,that will be ablento withstand any of the challenges,that climate change throws at usnin the coming years.,Let's create a water supplynthat uses local sources,and leaves more waternin the environment for fish and for food.,Let's create a water system that'snconsistent with out environmental values.,And let's do it for our childrennand our grandchildren,and let's tell them this is the system,that they have tontake care of in the future,because it's our last chancento create a new kind of water system. 
 Thank you very much for your attention. 
 (Applause)I'm really glad to be here.,I'm glad you're here,,because that would be a little weird.,I'm glad we're all here.,And by "here," I don't mean here.,Or here.,But here.,I mean Earth.,And by "we," I don't meannthose of us in this auditorium,,but life,,all life on Earth -- 
 (Laughter) 
 from complex to single-celled,,from mold to mushrooms,to flying bears. 
 (Laughter) 
 The interesting thing is,,Earth is the only placenwe know of that has life --,8.7 million species.,We've looked other places,,maybe not as hardnas we should or we could,,but we've looked and haven't found any;,Earth is the only placenwe know of with life.,Is Earth special?,This is a question I've wantednto know the answer to,since I was a small child,,and I suspect 80 percentnof this auditorium,has thought the same thingnand also wanted to know the answer.,To understand whethernthere are any planets --,out there in our solar system or beyond --,that can support life,,the first step is to understandnwhat life here requires. 
 It turns out, of all of thosen8.7 million species,,life only needs three things.,On one side, all lifenon Earth needs energy.,Complex life like us derivesnour energy from the sun,,but life deep undergroundncan get its energy,from things like chemical reactions.,There are a numbernof different energy sources,available on all planets.,On the other side,,all life needs food or nourishment.,And this seems like a tall order,nespecially if you want a succulent tomato. 
 (Laughter) 
 However, all life on Earthnderives its nourishment,from only six chemical elements,,and these elements can be foundnon any planetary body,in our solar system.,So that leaves the thingnin the middle as the tall pole,,the thing that's hardest to achieve.,Not moose, but water. 
 (Laughter) 
 Although moose would be pretty cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 And not frozen water, and not waternin a gaseous state, but liquid water.,This is what life needsnto survive, all life.,And many solar system bodiesndon't have liquid water,,and so we don't look there.,Other solar system bodiesnmight have abundant liquid water,,even more than Earth,,but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,,and so it's hard to access,nit's hard to get to,,it's hard to even find outnif there's any life there. 
 So that leaves a few bodiesnthat we should think about.,So let's make the problemnsimpler for ourselves.,Let's think only about liquid waternon the surface of a planet.,There are only three bodiesnto think about in our solar system,,with regard to liquid waternon the surface of a planet,,and in order of distance from the sun,nit's: Venus, Earth and Mars.,You want to have an atmospherenfor water to be liquid.,You have to be very carefulnwith that atmosphere.,You can't have too much atmosphere,ntoo thick or too warm an atmosphere,,because then you end upntoo hot like Venus,,and you can't have liquid water.,But if you have too little atmospherenand it's too thin and too cold,,you end up like Mars, too cold.,So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,,and Earth is just right.,You can look at these images behind menand you can see automatically,where life can survivenin our solar system.,It's a Goldilocks-type problem,,and it's so simplenthat a child could understand it. 
 However,,I'd like to remind you of two things,from the Goldilocks storynthat we may not think about so often,but that I think are really relevant here.,Number one:,if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,when Goldilocks walks into the room,,does that mean it's always been too cold?,Or could it have been just rightnat some other time?,When Goldilocks walks into the roomndetermines the answer,that we get in the story.,And the same is true with planets.,They're not static things. They change.,They vary. They evolve.,And atmospheres do the same.,So let me give you an example. 
 Here's one of my favoritenpictures of Mars.,It's not the highest resolution image,nit's not the sexiest image,,it's not the most recent image,,but it's an image that shows riverbedsncut into the surface of the planet;,riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;,riverbeds that take hundreds or thousandsnor tens of thousands of years to form.,This can't happen on Mars today.,The atmosphere of Mars todaynis too thin and too cold,for water to be stable as a liquid.,This one image tells younthat the atmosphere of Mars changed,,and it changed in big ways.,And it changed from a statenthat we would define as habitable,,because the three requirementsnfor life were present long ago.,Where did that atmosphere go,that allowed waternto be liquid at the surface? 
 Well, one idea is it escapednaway to space.,Atmospheric particlesngot enough energy to break free,from the gravity of the planet,,escaping away to space, never to return.,And this happens with all bodiesnwith atmospheres.,Comets have tails,that are incredibly visible remindersnof atmospheric escape.,But Venus also has an atmospherenthat escapes with time,,and Mars and Earth as well.,It's just a matter of degreenand a matter of scale.,So we'd like to figure outnhow much escaped over time,so we can explain this transition. 
 How do atmospheresnget their energy for escape?,How do particles getnenough energy to escape?,There are two ways, if we're goingnto reduce things a little bit.,Number one, sunlight.,Light emitted from the sun can be absorbednby atmospheric particles,and warm the particles.,Yes, I'm dancing, but they -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh my God, not even at my wedding. 
 (Laughter) 
 They get enough energynto escape and break free,from the gravity of the planetnjust by warming.,A second way they can get energynis from the solar wind.,These are particles, mass, material,nspit out from the surface of the sun,,and they go screamingnthrough the solar system,at 400 kilometers per second,,sometimes faster during solar storms,,and they go hurtlingnthrough interplanetary space,towards planets and their atmospheres,,and they may provide energy,for atmospheric particlesnto escape as well. 
 This is something that I'm interested in,,because it relates to habitability.,I mentioned that there were two thingsnabout the Goldilocks story,that I wanted to bring to your attentionnand remind you about,,and the second onenis a little bit more subtle.,If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,,and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,,shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder,if we're following the trend?,This thing that you've acceptednyour entire life,,when you think about it a little bit more,nmay not be so simple.,And of course, distance of a planetnfrom the sun determines its temperature.,This has to play into habitability.,But maybe there are other thingsnwe should be thinking about.,Maybe it's the bowls themselves,that are also helping to determinenthe outcome in the story,,what is just right. 
 I could talk to you about a lotnof different characteristics,of these three planets,that may influence habitability,,but for selfish reasons relatednto my own research,and the fact that I'm standing up herenholding the clicker and you're not -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I would like to talknfor just a minute or two,about magnetic fields.,Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.,Magnetic fields are generatednin the deep interior of a planet,by electrically conductingnchurning fluid material,that creates this big old magnetic fieldnthat surrounds Earth.,If you have a compass,nyou know which way north is.,Venus and Mars don't have that.,If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,,congratulations, you're lost. 
 (Laughter) 
 Does this influence habitability?,Well, how might it?,Many scientists thinknthat a magnetic field of a planet,serves as a shield for the atmosphere,,deflecting solar wind particlesnaround the planet,in a bit of a force field-type effect,having to do with electric chargenof those particles.,I like to think of it insteadnas a salad bar sneeze guard for planets. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yes, my colleaguesnwho watch this later will realize,this is the first time in the historynof our community,that the solar wind has beennequated with mucus. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so the effect, then, is that Earthnmay have been protected,for billions of years,,because we've had a magnetic field.,Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.,Mars, on the other hand,nhas been unprotected,because of its lack of magnetic field,,and over billions of years,,maybe enough atmospherenhas been stripped away,to account for a transitionnfrom a habitable planet,to the planet that we see today. 
 Other scientists thinknthat magnetic fields,may act more like the sails on a ship,,enabling the planet to interactnwith more energy from the solar wind,than the planet would have been ablento interact with by itself.,The sails may gather energynfrom the solar wind.,The magnetic field may gathernenergy from the solar wind,that allows even morenatmospheric escape to happen.,It's an idea that has to be tested,,but the effect and how it works,seems apparent.,That's because we know,energy from the solar windnis being deposited into our atmosphere,here on Earth.,That energy is conductednalong magnetic field lines,down into the polar regions,,resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.,If you've ever experienced them,nit's magnificent.,We know the energy is getting in.,We're trying to measurenhow many particles are getting out,and if the magnetic fieldnis influencing this in any way. 
 So I've posed a problem for you here,,but I don't have a solution yet.,We don't have a solution.,But we're working on it.nHow are we working on it?,Well, we've sent spacecraftnto all three planets.,Some of them are orbiting now,,including the MAVEN spacecraftnwhich is currently orbiting Mars,,which I'm involved withnand which is led here,,out of the University of Colorado.,It's designed to measurenatmospheric escape.,We have similar measurementsnfrom Venus and Earth.,Once we have all our measurements,,we can combine all these together,nand we can understand,how all three planets interactnwith their space environment,,with the surroundings.,And we can decide whether magnetic fieldsnare important for habitability,or not. 
 Once we have that answer,nwhy should you care?,I mean, I care deeply ...,And financially as well, but deeply. 
 (Laughter) 
 First of all, an answer to this question,will teach us morenabout these three planets,,Venus, Earth and Mars,,not only about how they interactnwith their environment today,,but how they were billions of years ago,,whether they were habitablenlong ago or not.,It will teach us about atmospheres,that surround us and that are close.,But moreover, what we learnnfrom these planets,can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,,including planets that we're nownobserving around other stars.,For example, the Kepler spacecraft,,which is built and controllednhere in Boulder,,has been observingna postage stamp-sized region of the sky,for a couple years now,,and it's found thousands of planets --,in one postage stamp-sizednregion of the sky,that we don't think is any differentnfrom any other part of the sky. 
 We've gone, in 20 years,,from knowing of zero planetsnoutside of our solar system,,to now having so many,,that we don't knownwhich ones to investigate first.,Any lever will help.,In fact, based on observationsnthat Kepler's taken,and other similar observations,,we now believe that,,of the 200 billion starsnin the Milky Way galaxy alone,,on average, every starnhas at least one planet.,In addition to that,,estimates suggest there are somewherenbetween 40 billion and 100 billion,of those planetsnthat we would define as habitable,in just our galaxy. 
 We have the observations of those planets,,but we just don't knownwhich ones are habitable yet.,It's a little bit likenbeing trapped on a red spot -- 
 (Laughter) 
 on a stage,and knowing that there arenother worlds out there,and desperately wanting to knownmore about them,,wanting to interrogate them and find outnif maybe just one or two of them,are a little bit like you.,You can't do that.nYou can't go there, not yet.,And so you have to use the toolsnthat you've developed around you,for Venus, Earth and Mars,,and you have to apply themnto these other situations,,and hope that you're makingnreasonable inferences from the data,,and that you're going to be ablento determine the best candidates,for habitable planets,nand those that are not. 
 In the end, and for now, at least,,this is our red spot, right here.,This is the only planetnthat we know of that's habitable,,although very soon we mayncome to know of more.,But for now, this isnthe only habitable planet,,and this is our red spot.,I'm really glad we're here. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Science.,The very word for many of you conjuresnunhappy memories of boredom,in high school biology or physics class.,But let me assure that what you did there,had very little to do with science.,That was really the "what" of science.,It was the historynof what other people had discovered.,What I'm most interested in as a scientist,is the "how" of science.,Because science is knowledge in process.,We make an observation,nguess an explanation for that observation,,and then make a predictionnthat we can test,with an experiment or other observation. 
 A couple of examples.,First of all, people noticednthat the Earth was below, the sky above,,and both the Sun and the Moonnseemed to go around them.,Their guessed explanation,was that the Earth must benthe center of the universe.,The prediction: everythingnshould circle around the Earth.,This was first really tested,when Galileo got his handsnon one of the first telescopes,,and as he gazed into the night sky,,what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,,with four moons circling around it.,He then used those moonsnto follow the path of Jupiter,and found that Jupiternalso was not going around the Earth,but around the Sun.,So the prediction test failed.,And this led tonthe discarding of the theory,that the Earth was the centernof the universe. 
 Another example: Sir Isaac Newtonnnoticed that things fall to the Earth.,The guessed explanation was gravity,,the prediction that everythingnshould fall to the Earth.,But of course, not everythingndoes fall to the Earth.,So did we discard gravity?,No. We revised the theory and said,ngravity pulls things to the Earth,unless there is an equalnand opposite force in the other direction.,This led us to learn something new.,We began to pay more attentionnto the bird and the bird's wings,,and just think of all the discoveries,that have flownnfrom that line of thinking.,So the test failures,nthe exceptions, the outliers,teach us what we don't knownand lead us to something new.,This is how science moves forward.nThis is how science learns. 
 Sometimes in the media,nand even more rarely,,but sometimes even scientists will say,that something or othernhas been scientifically proven.,But I hope that you understandnthat science never proves anything,definitively forever.,Hopefully science remains curious enough,to look for,and humble enough to recognize,when we have found,the next outlier,,the next exception,,which, like Jupiter's moons,,teaches us what we don't actually know. 
 We're going to change gearsnhere for a second.,The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,,means a lot of different thingsnto different people,,but most of ournpublic discourse on medicine,really turns it intonan engineering problem.,We have the hallways of Congress,,and the boardrooms of insurance companiesnthat try to figure out how to pay for it.,The ethicists and epidemiologists,try to figure outnhow best to distribute medicine,,and the hospitals and physiciansnare absolutely obsessed,with their protocols and checklists,,trying to figure outnhow best to safely apply medicine.,These are all good things.,However, they also all assume,at some level,that the textbook of medicine is closed.,We start to measurenthe quality of our health care,by how quickly we can access it.,It doesn't surprise menthat in this climate,,many of our institutionsnfor the provision of health care,start to look a heck of a lotnlike Jiffy Lube. 
 (Laughter) 
 The only problem is thatnwhen I graduated from medical school,,I didn't get one of thosenlittle doohickeys,that your mechanicnhas to plug into your car,and find out exactly what's wrong with it,,because the textbook of medicine,is not closed.,Medicine is science.,Medicine is knowledge in process.,We make an observation,,we guess an explanationnof that observation,,and then we make a predictionnthat we can test.,Now, the testing groundnof most predictions in medicine,is populations.,And you may remembernfrom those boring days in biology class,that populations tend to distribute,around a mean,as a Gaussian or a normal curve.,Therefore, in medicine,,after we make a predictionnfrom a guessed explanation,,we test it in a population.,That means that what we know in medicine,,our knowledge and our know-how,,comes from populations,but extends only as far,as the next outlier,,the next exception,,which, like Jupiter's moons,,will teach us what we don't actually know. 
 Now, I am a surgeon,who looks after patients with sarcoma.,Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.,It's the cancer of flesh and bones.,And I would tell you that every onenof my patients is an outlier,,is an exception.,There is no surgery I have ever performednfor a sarcoma patient,that has ever been guidednby a randomized controlled clinical trial,,what we consider the best kindnof population-based evidence in medicine.,People talk about thinkingnoutside the box,,but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.,What we do have as we takena bath in the uncertainty,and unknowns and exceptionsnand outliers that surround us in sarcoma,is easy access to what I thinknare those two most important values,for any science:,humility and curiosity.,Because if I am humble and curious,,when a patient asks me a question,,and I don't know the answer,,I'll ask a colleague,who may have a similarnalbeit distinct patient with sarcoma.,We'll even establishninternational collaborations.,Those patients will startnto talk to each other through chat rooms,and support groups.,It's through this kindnof humbly curious communication,that we begin to try and learn new things. 
 As an example, this is a patient of mine,who had a cancer near his knee.,Because of humbly curious communication,in international collaborations,,we have learned that we can repurposenthe ankle to serve as the knee,when we have to remove the kneenwith the cancer.,He can then wear a prostheticnand run and jump and play.,This opportunity was available to him,because of international collaborations.,It was desirable to him,because he had contacted other patientsnwho had experienced it.,And so exceptions and outliers in medicine,teach us what we don't know,nbut also lead us to new thinking. 
 Now, very importantly,,all the new thinking that outliersnand exceptions lead us to in medicine,does not only applynto the outliers and exceptions.,It is not that we only learnnfrom sarcoma patients,ways to manage sarcoma patients.,Sometimes, the outliers,and the exceptions,teach us things that matter quite a lotnto the general population.,Like a tree standing outside a forest,,the outliers and the exceptionsndraw our attention,and lead us into a much greater sensenof perhaps what a tree is.,We often talk aboutnlosing the forests for the trees,,but one also loses a tree,within a forest.,But the tree that stands out by itself,makes those relationshipsnthat define a tree,,the relationships between trunknand roots and branches,,much more apparent.,Even if that tree is crooked,or even if that treenhas very unusual relationships,between trunk and roots and branches,,it nonetheless draws our attention,and allows us to make observations,that we can then testnin the general population. 
 I told you that sarcomas are rare.,They make up about one percentnof all cancers.,You also probably know that cancernis considered a genetic disease.,By genetic disease we meannthat cancer is caused by oncogenes,that are turned on in cancer,and tumor suppressor genesnthat are turned off to cause cancer.,You might thinknthat we learned about oncogenes,and tumor suppressor genesnfrom common cancers,like breast cancer and prostate cancer,and lung cancer,,but you'd be wrong.,We learned about oncogenesnand tumor suppressor genes,for the first time,in that itty-bitty little one percentnof cancers called sarcoma.,In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize,for realizing that chickens,had a transmissible form of sarcoma.,Thirty years later, Harold Varmusnand Mike Bishop discovered,what that transmissible element was.,It was a virus,carrying a gene,,the src oncogene.,Now, I will not tell younthat src is the most important oncogene.,I will not tell you,that src is the most frequentlynturned on oncogene in all of cancer.,But it was the first oncogene.,The exception, the outlier,drew our attention and led us to something,that taught us very important thingsnabout the rest of biology. 
 Now, TP53 is the most importantntumor suppressor gene.,It is the most frequently turned offntumor suppressor gene,in almost every kind of cancer.,But we didn't learn about itnfrom common cancers.,We learned about itnwhen doctors Li and Fraumeni,were looking at families,,and they realized that these families,had way too many sarcomas.,I told you that sarcoma is rare.,Remember that a onenin a million diagnosis,,if it happens twice in one family,,is way too common in that family.,The very fact that these are rare,draws our attention,and leads us to new kinds of thinking. 
 Now, many of you may say,,and may rightly say,,that yeah, Kevin, that's great,,but you're not talkingnabout a bird's wing.,You're not talking about moonsnfloating around some planet Jupiter.,This is a person.,This outlier, this exception,nmay lead to the advancement of science,,but this is a person.,And all I can say,is that I know that all too well.,I have conversations with these patientsnwith rare and deadly diseases.,I write about these conversations.,These conversations are terribly fraught.,They're fraught with horrible phrases,like "I have bad news"nor "There's nothing more we can do.",Sometimes these conversationsnturn on a single word:,"terminal." 
 Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.,Where the blanks are in medicine,can be just as important,as the words that we usenin these conversations.,What are the unknowns?,What are the experimentsnthat are being done? 
 Do this little exercise with me.,Up there on the screen,nyou see this phrase, "no where.",Notice where the blank is.,If we move that blank one space over,"no where",becomes "now here,",the exact opposite meaning,,just by shifting the blank one space over. 
 I'll never forget the night,that I walked intonone of my patients' rooms.,I had been operating long that day,but I still wanted to come and see him.,He was a boy I had diagnosednwith a bone cancer a few days before.,He and his mother had been meetingnwith the chemotherapy doctors,earlier that day,,and he had been admittednto the hospital to begin chemotherapy.,It was almost midnightnwhen I got to his room.,He was asleep, but I found his mother,reading by flashlight,next to his bed.,She came out in the hallnto chat with me for a few minutes.,It turned out thatnwhat she had been reading,was the protocolnthat the chemotherapy doctors,had given her that day.,She had memorized it.,She said, "Dr. Jones, you told me,that we don't always win,with this type of cancer,,but I've been studying this protocol,nand I think I can do it.,I think I can complynwith these very difficult treatments.,I'm going to quit my job.nI'm going to move in with my parents.,I'm going to keep my baby safe.",I didn't tell her.,I didn't stop to correct her thinking.,She was trusting in a protocol,that even if complied with,,wouldn't necessarily save her son.,I didn't tell her.,I didn't fill in that blank.,But a year and a half later,her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.,Should I have told her? 
 Now, many of you may say, "So what?,I don't have sarcoma.,No one in my family has sarcoma.,And this is all fine and well,,but it probably doesn'tnmatter in my life.",And you're probably right.,Sarcoma may not matterna whole lot in your life.,But where the blanks are in medicine,does matter in your life. 
 I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.,I told you that in medicine,nwe test predictions in populations,,but I didn't tell you,,and so often medicine never tells you,that every time an individual,encounters medicine,,even if that individual is firmlynembedded in the general population,,neither the individualnnor the physician knows,where in that populationnthe individual will land.,Therefore, every encounter with medicine,is an experiment.,You will be a subject,in an experiment.,And the outcome will be eitherna better or a worse result for you.,As long as medicine works well,,we're fine with fast service,,bravado, brimminglynconfident conversations.,But when things don't work well,,sometimes we want something different. 
 A colleague of minenremoved a tumor from a patient's limb.,He was concerned about this tumor.,In our physician conferences,nhe talked about his concern,that this was a type of tumor,that had a high risknfor coming back in the same limb.,But his conversations with the patient,were exactly what a patient might want:,brimming with confidence.,He said, "I got it allnand you're good to go.",She and her husband were thrilled.,They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,nopened a bottle of champagne.,The only problem was a few weeks later,,she started to noticenanother nodule in the same area.,It turned out he hadn't gotten it all,nand she wasn't good to go.,But what happened at this juncturenabsolutely fascinates me.,My colleague came to me and said,,"Kevin, would you mindnlooking after this patient for me?",I said, "Why, you know the right thingnto do as well as I do.,You haven't done anything wrong.",He said, "Please, just looknafter this patient for me.",He was embarrassed --,not by what he had done,,but by the conversation that he had had,,by the overconfidence. 
 So I performedna much more invasive surgery,and had a very different conversationnwith the patient afterwards.,I said, "Most likely I've gotten it all,and you're most likely good to go,,but this is the experimentnthat we're doing.,This is what you're going to watch for.,This is what I'm going to watch for.,And we're going to work togethernto find out if this surgery will work,to get rid of your cancer.",I can guarantee you, she and her husband,did not crack another bottle of champagnenafter talking to me.,But she was now a scientist,,not only a subject in her experiment. 
 And so I encourage you,to seek humility and curiosity,in your physicians.,Almost 20 billion times each year,,a person walks into a doctor's office,,and that person becomes a patient.,You or someone you lovenwill be that patient sometime very soon.,How will you talk to your doctors?,What will you tell them?,What will they tell you?,They cannot tell you,what they do not know,,but they can tell you when they don't know,if only you'll ask.,So please, join the conversation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I opened a blind man's head.,I didn't make him think or reflect --nI cracked his head open, literally.,We were walking with himnholding onto my shoulder,,I miscalculated how much spacenthere was between us,,and I knocked him into a gate. 
 (Laughter) 
 Five stitches in his forehead.,At that moment, I felt likenthe worst teacher in the world.,I really didn't know how to apologize.,Luckily, El Pulga is one of those peoplenwho takes things quite well.,And to this day, he saysnthat I was the coach,who left the most importantnmark on his career. 
 (Laughter) 
 The truth is, when I started workingnat the institute for the blind,,I was surprised by a lot of things.,A lot of the things they did,nI never imagined they could:,they swam, did exercise, played cards.,They drank mate, and could pour it,without burning themselves in the process. 
 But when I saw them playing soccer --,that was amazing.,They had a dirt field,nrusty goalposts and broken nets.,The blind who attended the institutenwould play their games there,,just like I did at a field near my house.,But they played without being able to see.,The ball made a soundnso they could locate it.,They had a guidenbehind the rival team's goal,to know where to kick the ball.,And they used eye masks.,There were guysnwho could still see a little,,and they wore eye masksnso everyone was equal. 
 When I was more at ease with them,nI asked for a mask myself.,I put it on and tried to play.,I had played soccer all my life.,This is where it got even more amazing:,within two seconds, I didn't knownwhere I was standing.,I had studied physical educationnbecause I loved high performance. 
 I started workingnat the institute by chance.,My other job was with the ArgentiniannNational Rowing Team,,and I felt that was my thing.,Here, everything was twice as hard.,I'll never forget the first daynI did the warm-up with the team.,I lined them up in front of me --,I used to do that with the rowing team --,and I said, "OK, everyonenbend down," going like this.,When I looked up, two guys were seated,,three were lying downnand others were squatting. 
 (Laughter) 
 How could I do herenthe same things I was doing there?,It took me a while.,I started looking for toolsnto learn from them,,from the teachers who worked with them.,I learned I couldn't explain a playnon a chalkboard like a coach does,,but I could use a plastic traynand some bottle caps,so they could follow me by way of touch.,I also learned they could run on a track,if I ran with them, holding a rope.,So we started looking for volunteersnto help us run with them. 
 I was enjoying it,,and finding purpose and meaningnin what we were doing.,It was hard at first,nit was uncomfortable,,but I decided to overcome the discomfort.,And there came a time,when it became the mostnfascinating job I'd ever had. 
 I think that's when I wondered:,Why couldn't we bena high-performance team as well?,Of course, one thing was missing:,I needed to find out what they wanted,,the real protagonists of this story.,Three hours of training,nplaying soccer on that field,,were not going to be enough.,We would have to train differently. 
 We started to train harder,nand the results were great;,they asked for more.,I came to understandnthat they, too, wondered,why they couldn't do high-performance.,When we felt ready,nwe knocked at CENARD's door.,CENARD is the National Centernfor High-Performance Sports,here in Argentina.,It was hard to get themnto hear what we had to say.,But it was considerably more difficult,to get the other athletes training therento consider us their equals.,In fact, they would let us use the field,only when no other teams were using it.,And we were known as "the blind ones.",Not everyone knewnexactly what we were doing there. 
 The 2006 World Championshipnwas a turning point in the team's history.,It was held in Buenos Airesnfor the first time.,It was our chance to show everyone,what we had been doing all that time.,We made it to the finals.,We were growing as a team. 
 It was us against Brazil in the finals.,They were the best team in the tournament.,They won every game by a landslide.,Hardly anyone believednwe could win that game.,Hardly anyone -- except for us. 
 During pre-game meetings,,in the locker room,,during each warm-up,,it smelled of victory.,I swear that smell exists.,I smelled it several times with the team,,but I remember it in particular,nthe day before we played that final.,The Argentine Football Associationnhad opened their doors to us. 
 We were training at AFA,,where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.,For the first time ever,,we felt like a true national team.,At 7:30pm, the day before the game,,we were in the lounge discussing strategy,,and a waiter knocks on the door,ninterrupting our conversation.,He suggested we go to church.,He came to invite us to church.,I tried to get rid of him,nsaying it wasn't a good time,,that we better leave it for another day.,He kept insisting, asking me to pleasenlet him take the guys to church,,because that day, a pastornwho performed miracles would be there. 
 I was slightly afraid to asknwhat type of miracles he meant,,and he replied nonchalantly,,"Coach, let me takenthe team to the church,,and when we return, I guaranteenthat half of them will be able to see." 
 (Laughter) 
 Some of the guys laughed,,but imagine being a blind personnand someone says that to you.,I didn't know what to say.,I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.,I didn't want to make him feel bad,,because he truly believednthis could happen. 
 One of the players saved me,,when he stood up and confidently said,,"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --,Gonza already told younit's not the best time to go to church.,Besides, let me make this clear:,if we go to that church, and I end upnbeing able to see when we return,,I will beat you so hardnif I can't play tomorrow." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Juan left, laughing in resignation,,and we continued with our pregame talk.,That night when I went to sleep,,I began to dreamnabout the next day's game,,imagining what could happen,nhow we would play.,And that's when I noticednthat smell of victory,I mentioned a while ago.,And it's becausenat that moment, I thought:,if the other players had the same desirenas Diego going into the game,,it was impossible for us not to win. 
 The next day was going to be wonderful.,We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,,and we were already eager to play.,We left AFA, and the bus was fullnof flags that people had given to us.,We were talking about the game,,and we could hear peoplenhonking and cheering,,"Go Murciélagos! Today's the day!nThe final challenge!" 
 The guys asked me, "Do they know us?nDo they know we're playing?",Some people followed the bus to CENARD.,We arrived and found an amazing scene.,In the corridor leadingnfrom the locker room to the game field,,I was walking with Silvio,,who was holding onto my shoulder,nso I could guide him.,Fortunately, there werenno gates along the way. 
 (Laughter) 
 When we reached the field,nhe asked me about everything.,He didn't want to miss a single detail.,He said, "Tell me what you see,ntell me who's playing the drums." 
 I tried to explain what was happeningnwith as much detail as possible.,I told him, "The stands are packed,na lot of people couldn't get in,,there are blue and white balloonsnall over the field,,they're opening a giant Argentine flagnthat covers the entire grandstand." 
 Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,,"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?",That's the city where he lives.,I started looking into the stands,and I spotted a little white flag,with lettering donenin black spray paint, that read:,"Silvio, your familynand all of San Pedro are here." 
 I told him that and he replied,,"That's my mom, tell me wherenshe is, I want to I wave at her.",I pointed him toward the flag,and showed him with his armnwhere they were sitting,,and he waved his arms in that direction.,About 20 or 30 people stood upnand gave him an ovation.,When that happened,,I saw how his face changed,nhow moved he was.,It was moving for me, too;,two seconds later,nI had a lump in my throat.,It was strange -- I felt bothnthe excitement of what was happening,,and the anger and the anguishnthat he could not see it. 
 A few days later when I told himnwhat I had experienced,,he tried to reassure me, saying,,"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.,Differently, but I swear to younthat I saw them all." 
 The game started.,We could not fail; it was the final.,The audience was quiet, like here,,because in soccer for the blind,,the public has to be quietnso the players can hear the ball.,They're only allowed to cheernwhen the game is over. 
 And when there were eight minutes to go,,the crowd did all the cheeringnthey hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.,When pigeon-toed Silvionnailed the ball at an angle,,they cheered with all their heart,,in an incredible way. 
 Today, if you go to CENARD,nyou'll see a huge poster on the door,,with a photo of our team,nLos Murciélagos.,They're a model national team,neveryone in CENARD knows who they are,,and after having wonntwo World Championships,and two Paralympic medals,,no one doubts they arenhigh-performance athletes. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 I was lucky to trainnthis team for 10 years,,first as a trainernand later as their coach.,I feel that they've given me much more,than what I've given them. 
 Last year, they asked me to coachnanother national team, Power Soccer.,It's a national team of young mennwho play soccer in wheelchairs.,They use motorized wheelchairsnthat they drive with a joystick,,because they don't havenenough strength in their arms,to use conventional chairs.,They added a bumper to the chair,na safeguard that protects their feet,,while allowing them to kick the ball.,It's the first time that, insteadnof being the spectators,,they're now the main characters.,It's the first time their parents,nfriends and siblings can see them play. 
 For me, it's a new challenge,,with the same discomfort,ninsecurity, and fear I had,when I started working with the blind.,But I approach it allnfrom a more experienced position.,That's why from day one,nI treat them as athletes on the field,,and off the field, I trynto put myself in their shoes,and behave without prejudice,,because treating them naturallynfeels best to them. 
 Both teams play soccer;nsomething once unthinkable for them.,They had to adapt the rules to do so.,And both teams broke the same rule --,the one that saidnthey couldn't play soccer. 
 When you see them play,nyou see competition, not disability.,The problem starts when the game is over,,and they leave the field.,Then they step in to play our game,,in a society whose rulesndon't really take them into account,or care for them. 
 I learned from sports,that disability greatly depends onnthe rules of the game.,I believe that if we changensome of the rules of our game,,we can make life a little easier for them. 
 We all know there are peoplenwith disabilities; we see them daily.,But by having no direct contact with them,,we're not aware of the problemsnthey face every day,,like how hard it is for themnto get on a bus,,find a job,,take the subway,or cross the street. 
 It's true that there is an increasingnsocial responsibility,regarding the inclusionnof people with disabilities.,But I think it's still not enough.,I think change needs to comenfrom every one of us.,First, by leaving behindnour indifference toward the disabled,,and then by respecting the rulesnthat do take them into account.,They are few, but they do exist. 
 I cracked a blind man's headnopen -- El Pulga's head.,I can assure you these two teamsnopened mine as well.,They taught me that above all,,you have to get out therenand play every game,in this beautiful tournamentnthat we call life. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We lost a lot of time at schoolnlearning spelling.,Kids are still losing a lot of timenat school with spelling.,That's why I want to sharena question with you:,Do we need new spelling rules?,I believe that yes, we do.,Or even better, I think we neednto simplify the ones we already have. 
 Neither the question nor the answernare new in the Spanish language.,They have been bouncing aroundnfrom century to century,since 1492, when in the first grammarnguide of the Spanish language,,Antonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simplenprinciple for our spelling:,"... thus, we have to write wordsnas we pronounce them,,and pronounce words as we write them.",Each sound was to correspondnto one letter,,each letter was to representna single sound,,and those which did not representnany sound should be removed.,This approach, the phonetic approach,,which says we have to writenwords as we pronounce them,,both is and isn't at the root of spellingnas we practice it today.,It is, because the Spanish language,nin contrast to English, French or others,,always strongly resistednwriting words too differently,to how we pronounce them. 
 But the phonetic approachnis also absent today,,because when, in the 18th century,nwe decided how we would standardize,our writing,,there was another approach which guidedna good part of the decisions.,It was the etymological approach,,the one that says we have to write words,according to how they were writtennin their original language,,in Latin, in Greek.,That's how we ended up with silent H's,nwhich we write but don't pronounce.,That's how we have B's and V's that,ncontrary to what many people believe,,were never differentiatednin Spanish pronunciation.,That's how we wound up with G's,,that are sometimes aspirated,nas in "gente,",and other times unaspirated, as in "gato.",That's how we ended upnwith C's, S's and Z's,,three letters that in some placesncorrespond to one sound,,and in others, to two,nbut nowhere to three. 
 I'm not here to tell you anythingnyou don't know from your own experience.,We all went to school,,we all invested big amountsnof learning time,,big amounts of pliant,nchildlike brain time,in dictation,,in the memorization of spelling rulesnfilled, nevertheless, with exceptions.,We were told in many ways,nimplicitly and explicitly,,that in spelling, something fundamentalnto our upbringing was at stake.,Yet, I have the feeling,that teachers didn't ask themselvesnwhy it was so important.,In fact, they didn't ask themselvesna previous question:,What is the purpose of spelling?,What do we need spelling for? 
 And the truth is, when someonenasks themselves this question,,the answer is much simplernand less momentous,than we'd usually believe.,We use spelling to unify the way we write,nso we can all write the same way,,making it easier for us to understandnwhen we read to each other.,But unlike in other aspects of languagensuch as punctuation,,in spelling, there's nonindividual expression involved.,In punctuation, there is.,With punctuation, I can choosento change the meaning of a phrase.,With punctuation, I can imposena particular rhythm to what I am writing,,but not with spelling.,When it comes to spelling,nit's either wrong or right,,according to whether it conformsnor not to the current rules.,But then, wouldn't it be more sensiblento simplify the current rules,so it would be easier to teach, learnnand use spelling correctly?,Wouldn't it be more sensiblento simplify the current rules,so that all the time we devote todaynto teaching spelling,,we could devote to other language issues,whose complexities do, in fact,ndeserve the time and effort? 
 What I propose is not to abolish spelling,,and have everyone write however they want.,Language is a tool of common usage,,and so I believe it's fundamentalnthat we use it following common criteria.,But I also find it fundamental,that those common criterianbe as simple as possible,,especially becausenif we simplify our spelling,,we're not leveling it down;,when spelling is simplified,,the quality of the languagendoesn't suffer at all. 
 I work every day with SpanishnGolden Age literature,,I read Garcilaso, Cervantes,nGóngora, Quevedo,,who sometimes write "hombre" without H,,sometimes write "escribir" with V,,and it's absolutely clear to me,that the difference between those textsnand ours is one of convention,,or rather, a lack of conventionnduring their time.,But it's not a difference of quality.,But let me go back to the masters,,because they're key charactersnin this story.,Earlier, I mentioned this slightlynthoughtless insistence,with which teachers pester and pester us,over spelling.,But the truth is,nthings being as they are,,this makes perfect sense.,In our society, spelling servesnas an index of privilege,,separating the cultured from the brute,nthe educated from the ignorant,,independent of the contentnthat's being written.,One can get or not get a job,because of an H that one put or did not.,One can becomenan object of public ridicule,because of a misplaced B.,Therefore, in this context,,of course, it makes sense to dedicatenall this time to spelling. 
 But we shouldn't forget,that throughout the historynof our language,,it has always been teachers,or people involvednin the early learning of language,who promoted spelling reforms,,who realized that in our spellingnthere was often an obstacle,to the transmission of knowledge.,In our case, for example,,Sarmiento, together with Andrés Bello,nspearheaded the biggest spelling reform,to take place in the Spanish language:,the mid-19th century Chilean reform.,Then, why not take overnthe task of those teachers,and start making progress in our spelling?,Here, in this intimate group of 10,000,,I'd like to bring to the table,some changes that I find reasonablento start discussing. 
 Let's remove the silent H.,In places where we write an Hnbut pronounce nothing,,let's not write anything. 
 (Applause) 
 It's hard for me to imaginenwhat sentimental attachment,can justify to someonenall the hassle caused by the silent H.,B and V, as we said before,,were never differentiatednin the Spanish language -- 
 (Applause) 
 Let's choose one; it could be either.nWe can discuss it, talk it over.,Everyone will have their preferencesnand can make their arguments.,Let's keep one, remove the other.,G and J, let's separate their roles.,G should keep the unaspirated sound,nlike in "gato," "mago," and "águila,",and J should keep the aspirated sound,,as in "jarabe," "jirafa,"n"gente," "argentino.",The case of C, S and Z is interesting,,because it shows that the phoneticnapproach must be a guide,,but it can't be an absolute principle.,In some cases, the differencesnin pronunciation must be addressed.,As I said before, C, S and Z,,in some places, correspondnto one sound, in others to two.,If we go from three lettersnto two, we're all better off. 
 To some, these changesnmay seem a bit drastic.,They're really not.,The Royal Spanish Academy,nall of language academies,,also believes that spellingnshould be progressively modified;,that language is linked to history,ntradition and custom,,but that at the same time,nit is a practical everyday tool,and that sometimes this attachmentnto history, tradition and custom,becomes an obstacle for its current usage.,Indeed, this explains the fact,that our language, much more thannthe others we are geographically close to,,has been historicallynmodifying itself based on us,,for example, we wentnfrom "ortographia" to "ortografía,",from "theatro" to "teatro,"nfrom "quantidad" to "cantidad,",from "symbolo" to "símbolo.",And some silent H's are slowlynbeing stealthily removed:,in the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,,"arpa" and "armonía" can be writtennwith or without an H.,And everybody is OK. 
 I also believe,that this is a particularly appropriatenmoment to have this discussion.,It's always said that languagenchanges spontaneously,,from the bottom up,,that its users are the onesnwho incorporate new words,and who introduce grammatical changes,,and that the authority --nin some places an academy,,in others a dictionary,nin others a ministry --,accepts and incorporates themnlong after the fact.,This is true onlynfor some levels of language.,It is true on the lexical level,nthe level of words.,It is less true on the grammatical level,,and I would almost saynit is not true for the spelling level,,that has historically changednfrom the top down.,Institutions have always been the onesnto establish the rules,and propose changes. 
 Why do I say this is a particularlynappropriate moment?,Until today,,writing always had a much more restrictednand private use than speech.,But in our time,nthe age of social networks,,this is going throughna revolutionary change.,Never before have people written so much;,never before have people writtennfor so many others to see.,And in these social networks,nfor the first time,,we're seeing innovative usesnof spelling on a large scale,,where even more-than-educated peoplenwith impeccable spelling,,when using social networks,,behave a lot like the majority of usersnof social networks behave.,That is to say, they slacknon spell-checking,and prioritize speed and efficacynin communication.,For now, on social networks,nwe see chaotic, individual usages.,But I think we havento pay attention to them,,because they're probably telling us,that an era that designatesna new place for writing,seeks new criteria for that writing.,I think we'd be wrongnto reject them, to discard them,,because we identify them as symptomsnof the cultural decay of our times.,No, I believe we have to observe them,norganize them and channel them,within guidelines that better correspondnto the needs of our times. 
 I can anticipate some objections.,There will be those who'll say,that if we simplify spellingnwe'll lose etymology.,Strictly speaking, if we wantednto preserve etymology,,it would go beyond just spelling.,We'd also have to learnnLatin, Greek, Arabic.,With simplified spelling,,we would normalize etymologynin the same place we do now:,in etymological dictionaries.,A second objection will comenfrom those who say:,"If we simplify spelling,nwe'll stop distinguishing,between words that differnin just one letter.",That is true, but it's not a problem.,Our language has homonyms,nwords with more than one meaning,,yet we don't confusenthe "banco" where we sit,with the "banco" where we deposit money,,or the "traje" that we wearnwith the things we "trajimos.",In the vast majority of situations,ncontext dispels any confusion. 
 But there's a third objection.,To me,,it's the most understandable,neven the most moving.,It's the people who'll say:n"I don't want to change.,I was brought up like this,nI got used to doing it this way,,when I read a written wordnin simplified spelling, my eyes hurt." 
 (Laughter) 
 This objection is, in part, in all of us.,What do I think we should do?,The same thing that's alwaysndone in these cases:,changes are made looking forward;nchildren are taught the new rules,,those of us who don't want to adaptncan write the way we're used to writing,,and hopefully, time will cementnthe new rules in place.,The success of every spelling reformnthat affects deeply rooted habits,lies in caution, agreement,ngradualism and tolerance.,At the same time, can't allownthe attachment to old customs,impede us from moving forward.,The best tribute we can pay to the past,is to improve upon what it's given us. 
 So I believe that we mustnreach an agreement,,that academies must reach an agreement,,and purge from our spelling rules,all the habits we practicenjust for the sake of tradition,,even if they are useless now.,I'm convinced that if we do that,in the humble but extremelynimportant realm of language,,we'll be leaving a better futurento the next generations. 
 (Applause)I'll never forget the sound,of laughing with my friends.,I'll never forget the sound,of my mother's voicenright before I fell asleep.,And I'll never forgetnthe comforting sound of water,trickling down a stream.,Imagine my fear, pure fear,,when, at the age of 10,,I was told I was going to lose my hearing.,And over the next five years,,it progressed until I was classifiednas profoundly deaf. 
 But I believe that losing my hearing,was one of the greatest giftsnI've ever received.,You see, I get to experiencenthe world in a unique way.,And I believe thatnthese unique experiences,that people with disabilities have,is what's going to help usnmake and design a better world,for everyone -- both for peoplenwith and without disabilities. 
 I used to be a disability rights lawyer,,and I spent a lot of my timenfocused on enforcing the law,,ensuring that accommodations were made.,And then I had to quicklynlearn international policy,,because I was asked to worknon the UN Convention,that protects people with disabilities.,As the leader of the NGO there,,I spent most of my energyntrying to convince people,about the capabilitiesnof people with disabilities.,But somewhere along the way,,and after many career transitions,that my parents weren't so happy about -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I stumbled upon a solution,that I believe may benan even more powerful tool,to solve some of the world'sngreatest problems,,disability or not.,And that tool is called design thinking. 
 Design thinking is a processnfor innovation and problem solving.,There are five steps.,The first is defining the problem,and understanding its constraints.,The second is observing peoplenin real-life situations,and empathizing with them.,Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --nthe more the better,,the wilder the better.,Fourth, prototyping:ngathering whatever you can,,whatever you can find,,to mimic your solution, to test it,and to refine it.,And finally, implementation:,ensuring that the solutionnyou came up with is sustainable. 
 Warren Berger says that design thinkingnteaches us to look sideways,,to reframe, to refine, to experiment,and, probably most importantly,,ask those stupid questions.,Design thinkers believenthat everyone is creative.,They believe in bringing peoplenfrom multiple disciplines together,,because they want to sharenmultiple perspectives,and bring them togethernand ultimately merge them,to form something new. 
 Design thinking is such a successfulnand versatile tool,that it has been appliednin almost every industry.,I saw the potential that it hadnfor the issues I faced,,so I decided to go back to school,and get my master's in social design.,This looks at how to use designnto create positive change in the world.,While I was there,,I fell in love with woodworking.,But what I quickly realized,was that I was missing out on something.,As you're working with a tool,,right before it's aboutnto kick back at you --,which means the piece or the toolnjumps back at you --,it makes a sound.,And I couldn't hear this sound.,So I decided,,why not try and solve it?,My solution was a pair of safety glasses,that were engineerednto visually alert the user,to pitch changes in the tool,,before the human ear could pick it up.,Why hadn't tool designersnthought of this before? 
 (Laughter) 
 Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.,I wasn't weighed down by expertisenor conventional wisdom.,The second is: I was Deaf.,My unique experience of the worldnhelped inform my solution. 
 And as I went on, I kept running intonmore and more solutions,that were originally madenfor people with disabilities,,and that ended up being picked up,,embraced and loved by the mainstream,,disability or not.,This is an OXO potato peeler.,It was originally designednfor people with arthritis,,but it was so comfortable,neverybody loved it.,Text messaging: that was originallyndesigned for people who are Deaf.,And as you know,neverybody loves that, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 I started thinking:,What if we changed our mindset?,What if we started designingnfor disability first --,not the norm?,As you see, when we designnfor disability first,,we often stumble uponnsolutions that are not only inclusive,,but also are often betternthan when we design for the norm. 
 And this excites me,,because this means that the energynit takes to accommodate someone,with a disability,can be leveraged, molded and played with,as a force for creativity and innovation.,This moves us from the mindsetnof trying to change the hearts,and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,,to becoming an alchemist,,the type of magician that this worldnso desperately needs,to solve some of its greatest problems. 
 Now, I also believe,that people with disabilitiesnhave great potential to be designers,within this design-thinking process.,Without knowing it, from a very early age,,I've been a design thinker,nfine-tuning my skills.,Design thinkers are, by nature,nproblem solvers.,So imagine listening to a conversation,and only understandingn50 percent of what is said.,You can't ask them to repeatnevery single word.,They would just get frustrated with you.,So without even realizing it,,my solution was to takenthe muffled sound I heard,,that was the beat,,and turn it into a rhythmnand place it with the lips I read.,Years later, someone commentednthat my writing had a rhythm to it.,Well, this is because I experiencenconversations as rhythms.,I also became really,nreally good at failing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Quite literally.,My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.,But what I learnednwas that when I picked myself up,and changed a few things around,,eventually, I succeeded.,Similarly, design thinkingnencourages people to fail,and fail often,,because eventually, you will succeed.,Very few great innovations in this world,have come from someone succeedingnon the first try. 
 I also experienced this lesson in sports.,I'll never forget my coachnsaying to my mom,,"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,,she would be on the national team.",But what my coach, and what Indidn't even know at the time,,was that my hearing lossnactually helped me excel at sports.,You see, when you lose your hearing,nnot only do you adapt your behavior,,but you also adapt your physical senses.,One example of this,is that my visualnattention span increased.,Imagine a soccer player,ncoming down the left flank.,Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,,and the ball is comingndown the left flank.,A person with normal hearingnwould have the visual perspective of this.,I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.,So I picked up the players over here,,that were moving aboutnand coming down the field.,And I picked them up quicker,nso that if the ball was passed,,I could reposition myselfnand be ready for that shot. 
 So as you can see,,I've been a design thinkernfor nearly all my life.,My observation skills have been honednso that I pick up on things,that others would never pick up on.,My constant need to adaptnhas made me a great ideator,and problem solver.,And I've often had to do thisnwithin limitations and constraints.,This is something that designersnalso have to deal with frequently. 
 My work most recently took me to Haiti.,Design thinkers often seek outnextreme situations,,because that often informsnsome of their best designs.,And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm. 
 I lived and workednwith 300 Deaf individuals,that were relocatednafter the 2010 earthquake.,But five and a half years later,,there still was no electricity;,there still was no safe drinking water;,there were still no job opportunities;,there was still rampant crime,nand it went unpunished.,International aid organizationsncame one by one.,But they came,with pre-determined solutions.,They didn't come readynto observe and to adapt,based on the community's needs.,One organization gave themngoats and chickens.,But they didn't realize,that there was so much hungernin that community,,that when the Deaf went to sleepnat night and couldn't hear,,people broke into their yardsnand their homes,and stole these chickens and goats,,and eventually they were all gone. 
 Now, if that organizationnhad taken the time,to observe Deaf people,nto observe the community,,they would have realized their problem,and perhaps they would havencome up with a solution,,something like a solar light,,lighting up a secure pennto put them in at night,to ensure their safety. 
 You don't have to be a design thinker,to insert the ideasnI've shared with you today.,You are creative.,You are a designer --,everyone is.,Let people like me help you.,Let people with disabilitiesnhelp you look sideways,,and in the process,,solve some of the greatest problems. 
 That's it. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have been a police officernfor a very, very long time.,And you see these notes in my handnbecause I'm also a black preacher. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you know anythingnabout black preachers,,we'll close, and then we'll keepngoing for another 20 minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I need this to keepnpushing this thing forward.,I've been a police officernfor a very long time,,and I mean I predated technology.,I'm talking about before pagers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Laugh if you want to,nbut I'm telling the truth.,I predate War on Our Fellow Man --nI mean, War on Drugs.,I predate all of that.,I predate so much,and I've been through ebbs and flows,and I've been through good and bad times,,and still I absolutely lovenbeing a police officer.,I love being a police officernbecause it's always been a calling for me,and never a job. 
 And even with that,,my personal truth is thatnlaw enforcement is in a crisis.,It's an invisible crisis,,and it has been for many, many years.,Even though we in law enforcement say,,"You know what?nWe can't arrest our way out of this.",We say in law enforcement things like,,"Yeah, it's illegal to profile.",You know what?,In law enforcement, we even agreenthat we have to adopt this thinking,and become more orientednto community policing.,And yet all the while, still,,we continue in the same vein,,the same vein that contradictsneverything that we just admitted. 
 And so that's the reason for me,nseveral years ago.,Because I was tired of the racism,nI was tired of discrimination,,I was tired of the "-isms"nand the schisms.,I was just so tired.,I was tired of the vicious cycle,,and I was tired of it evennin the beloved agency,in the department that I still love today.,And so my wife and I, we sat down,and we decided and we targetedna date that we would retire.,We would retire and I wouldngo off into the sunset,,maybe do ministry full time,nlove my wife a long time.,Y'all know what I'm talking about. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we decided that I would retire.,But then there was a higher power than I.,There was a love for the city,that I loved, that I grew up in,nthat I was educated in --,a city that pulled my heartnback into the system.,So we didn't retire.,We didn't retire,and so what happened was,,over the next -- I would say,n18 months, 19 months,,I had this passion to implementnsome radical policing.,And so now, over the next 19 months,,I shifted, and I transcendednfrom being a drug sergeant --,ready to retire as a drug sergeant --,and went from level to level to level,,until I find myselfnas a district commander,,commander of the worst districtnin Baltimore city.,We call it the Eastern District,,the most violent district,,the most impoverished district --,46 percent unemployment in that district.,National rating at that time,,national rating, the AIDSnand the tuberculosis [rating],,was always on the top 10 list,for zip codes for citiesnacross the nation,,or just zip codes across the nation.,The top 10 -- I didn't say state,nI didn't say city --,that little neighborhood. 
 And I said, you know what?nWe gotta do something different.,We gotta do something different.nWe gotta think radical.,We gotta think outside the box.,And so in order to bring changenthat I desperately wanted,and I desperately felt in my heart,,I had to start listeningnto that inner spirit.,I had to start listeningnto that man on the inside,that went against everythingnthat I had been trained to do. 
 But we still did it.,We still did it because we listenednto that inner spirit,,because I realized this:,if I was to see real police reform,in the communities that I hadnauthority over for public safety,,we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'. 
 We had to change it.,And so what we didnis we started to think holistically,and not paramilitarily.,So we thought differently.,And we started to realize,that it could never benand never should have been,us versus them.,And so I decided to comento that intersection,where I could meet all classes,nall races, all creeds, all colors;,where I would meet the businessesnand the faith-based,,and the eds, the meds,,and I would meet all the people,that made up the communitiesnthat I had authority over. 
 So I met them and I began to listen.,See, police have a problem.,Off the top, we want to bringnthings into the community,and come up with these extravagantnstrategies and deployments,,but we never talknto the community about them.,And we shove them into the communitynand say, "Take that.",But we said we'd get ridnof that stinkin' thinkin',,so we talked to our communities.,We said, "This is your community table.,We'll pull up a chair.nWe want to hear from you.,What's going to work in your community?",And then some great thingsnstarted to happen. 
 See, here's the thing:,I had to figure out a way to shiftn130 cops that were under my tutelage,from being occupiers of communities,to being partners.,I had to figure out how to do that.,Because here's the crazy thing:,in law enforcement, we have evolvedninto something incredible.,Listen, we have become great protectors.,We know how to protect you.,But we have exercised that armnso much, so very much.,If I was a natural police department,and I represented a police department,,you would see this incredible,nbeautiful, 23-inch arm. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.,No fat on it. Mmm it look good.nIt just look good! 
 (Laughter) 
 That's a great arm -- protection!,That's who we are, but we've exercisednit so much sometimes,that it has led to abuse.,It's led to coldness and callousnessnand dehumanized us.,And we've forgotten,the mantra across this nation,is to protect and serve.,Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you look at the other arm,,and then you look at itnand ... there it is. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, it's kinda weak.,It looks sickly.,It's withering and it's dying,because we've invested so muchnin our protective arm.,But we forgot to treat our communities,like they're our customers;,like they're our sons and daughters,nour brothers and sisters,,our mothers and fathers.,And so somehow, along the way,,we've gotten out of balance.,And because we are a proud profession,,it is very hard for us to looknin the mirror and see our mistakes.,It's even harder to make a change. 
 And so, as I try to hurrynand get through this,,I need to say this:,it's not just law enforcement, though.,Because every one of usnmakes up a community.,Everybody makes up a community.,And as communities -- can I say this? --,we have put too much responsibilitynon law enforcement.,Too much. 
 (Applause) 
 And then we have the audacitynand the nerve to get upset,with law enforcementnwhen we take action.,There is no way in the world,that we, as a community,nshould be calling the police,for kids playing ball in the street.,No way in the world that wenshould be calling the police,because my neighbor'snmusic is up too loud,,because his dog came overnto my yard and did a number two;,there's no way we shouldnbe calling the police.,But we have surrenderednso much of our responsibility.,Listen, when I was a little boyncoming up in Baltimore --,and listen, we playednrough in the street --,I ain't never see the policencome and break us up.,You know who came? It was the elders.,It was the parental figuresnin the community.,It was those guardians,nit was that village mentality.,They came and said, "Stop that!"nand "Do this." and "Stop that.",We had mentors throughoutnall of the community. 
 So it takes all of us, all of us.,And when I say community,,I'm talking about everythingnthat makes up a community, even --,listen, because I'm a preacher,nI'm very hard on the churches,,because I believe the churchesntoo often have become MIA,,missing in action.,I believe they have shiftednover the last 10, 20 years,from being community churches,,where you walk outside your door,nround the corner and you're in church.,They shifted from that and becamencommuter churches.,So you now have churches who havenbecome disconnected by default,from the very communitynwhere they're planted.,And they don't take carenof that community. 
 I could go on and on,nbut I really need to wrap this up.,Community and policing:,we've all lost that precious gift,nand I call it relational equity.,We've lost it with one another.,It's not somebody else's fault --,it's all of our fault.,We all take responsibility in this.,But I say this: it's not too latenfor all of us to build our cities,and nation to make it great again.,It is never too late.,It is never too late.,You see, after three years,of my four-and-a-half-yearncommandship in that district,,three years in,,after putting pastorsnin the car with my police,because I knew this --nit's a little secret --,I knew this:,it was hard to stay a nasty police officer,while you're riding aroundnwith a clergy. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You'd be getting in and out of the car,nlooking to your right, talking about:,"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,"nall day long -- you can't do it!,So we came up with somenincredible initiatives,,engagements for our communitynand police to build that trust back.,We began to deal with our youth,and with those who we considernare on the wrong side of the fence.,We knew we had an economic problem,,so we began to create jobs.,We knew there was sicknessnin our community,and they didn't have accessnto proper medical care,,so we'd partner up.,We got to that intersectionnand partnered up,with anybody that wantednto partner with us,and talked aboutnwhat we needed holistically,,never thinking about the crime.,Because at the end of the day,,if we took carenof the needs of the people,,if we got to the root cause,,the crime would take care of itself.,It would take care of itself. 
 (Applause) 
 And so, after three yearsnof a four-and-a-half-year stint,,we looked back and we looked over,and found out that we werenat a 40-year historical low:,our crime numbers, our homicides --,everything had droppedndown, back to the 1970s.,And it might go back further,,but the problem is, we onlynstarted keeping data since 1970.,Forty-year crime low, so much so,nI had other commanders call me,,"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?,Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And so we gave them some of that.,And in a short period of time,,the city went to a 30-year crime low.,For the first time in 30 years,nwe fell, Baltimore city,,to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.,And we celebrated,,because we had learnednto become great servers,,become great servers first. 
 But I gotta tell you this:nthese last few years,,as much as we had learned,to become great proactive police officers,and great relational police officersnrather than reactive,,these last years have disappointed me.,They have broken my heart.,The uprising still hurts.,It still hurts my heart,,because truly I believenthat it should've never happened.,I believe it should've never happened,if we were allowed to continuenalong the vein that we were in,,servicing our community,,treating them like human beings,ntreating them with respect,,loving on them first.,If we continued in that vein,,it would've never happened.,But somehow, we went backnto business as usual. 
 But I'm excited again!,I'm excited again, because nownwe have a police commissioner,who not only talksnabout community policing,,but he absolutely understands it,,and more importantly, he embraces it.,So I'm very excited now.,Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,,because we, as many cities,nI believe shall rise from the ashes.,I believe -- I truly believe -- 
 (Applause) 
 that we will be great again.,I believe,,as we continue to wrap armsnand continue to say,,"We're in this together,",because it's not just an intersection:,once we meet, we now gotta getnon the same path for the same goals,,and this city will become great again.,This nation will become great again.,Because we have the same goal:nwe all want peace.,We all want respect for one another.,We all want love.,And I believe we are back on that road,,and I'm so excited about it. 
 So listen, I thank you for giving mena few minutes of your time. 
 God bless you all. 
 (Applause) 
 God bless you. 
 (Applause)So this right here,is the tiny village of Elle,nclose to Lista.,It's right at the southernmostntip of Norway.,And on January 2 this year,,an elderly guy who lives in the village,,he went out to see what was cast ashore,during a recent storm.,And on a patch of grassnright next to the water's edge,,he found a wetsuit.,It was grey and black,nand he thought it looked cheap.,Out of each leg of the wetsuit,there were sticking two white bones.,It was clearly the remainsnof a human being. 
 And usually, in Norway,ndead people are identified quickly.,So the police started searching,through missing reportsnfrom the local area,,national missing reports,,and looked for accidentsnwith a possible connection.,They found nothing.,So they ran a DNA profile,,and they started searchingninternationally through Interpol.,Nothing.,This was a personnthat nobody seemed to be missing.,It was an invisible lifenheading for a nameless grave.,But then, after a month,,the police in Norway got a messagenfrom the police in the Netherlands.,A couple of months earlier,nthey had found a body,,in an identical wetsuit,nand they had no idea who this person was.,But the police in the Netherlandsnmanaged to trace the wetsuit,by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.,So they were then able to tell,that both wetsuits were boughtnby the same customer at the same time,,October 7, 2014,,in the French city of Calaisnby the English Channel.,But this was allnthey were able to figure out.,The customer paid cash.,There was no surveillancenfootage from the shop.,So it became a cold case. 
 We heard this story,,and it triggered me and my colleague,nphotographer Tomm Christiansen,,and we of course had the obvious question:nwho were these people?,At the time, I'd barelynheard about Calais,,but it took about twonor three seconds to figure out,Calais is basically known for two things.,It's the spot in continental Europenclosest to Britain,,and a lot of migrants and refugeesnare staying in this camp,and are trying desperatelynto cross over to Britain.,And right there was a plausible theorynabout the identity of the two people,,and the police made this theory as well.,Because if you or I or anybody elsenwith a firm connection to Europe,goes missing off the coast of France,npeople would just know.,Your friends or familynwould report you missing,,the police would come search for you,nthe media would know,,and there would benpictures of you on lampposts.,It's difficult to disappearnwithout a trace.,But if you just fled the war in Syria,,and your family,nif you have any family left,,don't necessarily know where you are,,and you're staying here illegally,amongst thousands of othersnwho come and go every day.,Well, if you disappear one day,nnobody will notice.,The police won't come search for younbecause nobody knows you're gone. 
 And this is what happenednto Shadi Omar Kataf,and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. 
 Me and Tomm went to Calaisnfor the first time in April this year,,and after three months of investigation,nwe were able to tell the story,about how these two young mennfled the war in Syria,,ended up stuck in Calais,,bought wetsuits and drownednin what seems to have been an attempt,to swim across the English Channelnin order to reach England.,It is a story about the factnthat everybody has a name,,everybody has a story,neverybody is someone.,But it is also a story about whatnit's like to be a refugee in Europe today. 
 So this is where we started our search.,This is in Calais.,Right now, between 3,500nand 5,000 people are living here,under horrible conditions.,It has been dubbednthe worst refugee camp in Europe.,Limited access to food,nlimited access to water,,limited access to health care.,Disease and infections are widespread.,And they're all stuck herenbecause they're trying to get to England,in order to claim asylum.,And they do that by hiding in the backnof trucks headed for the ferry,,or the Eurotunnel,,or they sneak insidenthe tunnel terminal at night,to try to hide on the trains. 
 Most want to go to Britainnbecause they know the language,,and so they figure it would be easiernto restart their lives from there.,They want to work, they want to study,,they want to be ablento continue their lives.,A lot of these people arenhighly educated and skilled workers.,If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,nyou'll meet lawyers, politicians,,engineers, graphic designers,nfarmers, soldiers.,You've got the whole spectrum.,But who all of these people are,usually gets lost in the waynwe talk about refugees and migrants,,because we usually do that in statistics. 
 So you have 60 million refugees globally.,About half a millionnhave made the crossing,over the Mediterraneanninto Europe so far this year,,and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.,But these are numbers,,and the numbers don't say anythingnabout who these people are,,where they came from, or why they're here. 
 And first, I want to tell younabout one of them.,This is 22-year-oldnMouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.,We first heard about himnafter being in Calais the first time,looking for answers to the theorynof the two dead bodies.,And after a while, we heard this story,about a Syrian mannwho was living in Bradford in England,,and had been desperately searchingnfor his nephew Mouaz for months.,And it turned out the last timenanybody had heard anything from Mouaz,was October 7, 2014.,That was the same datenthe wetsuits were bought.,So we flew over there and we met the uncle,and we did DNA samples of him,,and later on got additional DNA samplesnfrom Mouaz's closest relative,who now lives in Jordan.,The analysis concluded,the body who was found in a wetsuitnon a beach in the Netherlands,was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.,And while we were doingnall this investigation,,we got to know Mouaz's story.,He was born in the Syrian capitalnof Damascus in 1991.,He was raised in a middle class family,,and his father in the middle therenis a chemical engineer,who spent 11 years in prison for belongingnto the political opposition in Syria.,While his father was in prison,,Mouaz took responsibilitynand he cared for his three sisters.,They said he was that kind of guy.,Mouaz studied to becomenan electrical engineer,at the University of Damascus. 
 So a couple of years into the Syrian war,,the family fled Damascus and wentnto the neighboring country, Jordan.,Their father had problemsnfinding work in Jordan,,and Mouaz could not continue his studies,,so he figured, "OK, the best thingnI can do to help my family,would be to go somewherenwhere I can finish my studies,and find work.",So he goes to Turkey. 
 In Turkey, he's not acceptednat a university,,and once he had left Jordan as a refugee,nhe was not allowed to reenter.,So then he decides to head for the UK,,where his uncle lives.,He makes it into Algeria,nwalks into Libya,,pays a people smuggler to help himnwith the crossing into Italy by boat,,and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,,the city right next to Calaisnby the English Channel.,We know he made at least 12 failednattempts to cross the English Channel,by hiding in a truck.,But at some point,nhe must have given up all hope.,The last night we know he was alive,,he spent at a cheap hotelnclose to the train station in Dunkirk.,We found his name in the records,nand he seems to have stayed there alone.,The day after, he went into Calais,nentered a sports shop,a couple of minutesnbefore 8 o'clock in the evening,,along with Shadi Kataf.,They both bought wetsuits,,and the woman in the shop,was the last person we know ofnto have seen them alive.,We have tried to figure outnwhere Shadi met Mouaz,,but we weren't able to do that.,But they do have a similar story.,We first heard about Shadinafter a cousin of his, living in Germany,,had read an Arabic translationnof the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.,So we got in touch with him.,Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,,was also raised in Damascus.,He was a working kind of guy.,He ran a tire repair shopnand later worked in a printing company.,He lived with his extended family,,but their house got bombednearly in the war.,So the family fled to an areanof Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk. 
 Yarmouk is being describednas the worst place to live,on planet Earth.,They've been bombed by the military,nthey've been besieged,,they've been stormed by ISIS,and they've been cut offnfrom supplies for years.,There was a UN officialnwho visited last year,,and he said, "They ate all the grassnso there was no grass left.",Out of a population of 150,000,,only 18,000 are believednto still be left in Yarmouk.,Shadi and his sisters got out.,The parents are still stuck inside. 
 So Shadi and one of his sisters,nthey fled to Libya.,This was after the fall of Gaddafi,,but before Libya turnedninto full-blown civil war.,And in this last remainingnsort of stability in Libya,,Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemednto spend most of his time underwater.,He fell completely in love with the ocean,,so when he finally decidednthat he could no longer be in Libya,,late August 2014,,he hoped to find worknas a diver when he reached Italy.,Reality was not that easy.,We don't know much about his travels,because he had a hard timencommunicating with his family,,but we do know that he struggled.,And by the end of September,,he was living on the streetsnsomewhere in France.,On October 7, he callsnhis cousin in Belgium,,and explains his situation.,He said, "I'm in Calais. I need younto come get my backpack and my laptop.,I can't afford to pay the people smugglersnto help me with the crossing to Britain,,but I will go buy a wetsuitnand I will swim.",His cousin, of course,ntried to warn him not to,,but Shadi's batterynon the phone went flat,,and his phone was never switched on again.,What was left of Shadinwas found nearly three months later,,800 kilometers away,in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.,He's still waitingnfor his funeral in Norway,,and none of his familynwill be able to attend. 
 Many may think that the storynabout Shadi and Mouaz,is a story about death,,but I don't agree.,To me, this is a story about two questionsnthat I think we all share:,what is a better life,,and what am I willing to do to achieve it?,And to me, and probably a lot of you,,a better life would mean,being able to do morenof what we think of as meaningful,,whether that be spending more timenwith your family and friends,,travel to an exotic place,,or just getting moneynto buy that cool new device,or a pair of new sneakers.,And this is allnwithin our reach pretty easily. 
 But if you are fleeing a war zone,,the answers to those two questionsnare dramatically different.,A better life is a life in safety.,It's a life in dignity.,A better life meansnnot having your house bombed,,not fearing being kidnapped.,It means being ablento send your children to school,,go to university,,or just find work to be able to providenfor yourself and the ones you love.,A better life would bena future of some possibilities,compared to nearly none,,and that's a strong motivation.,And I have no trouble imagining,that after spending weeks or even months,as a second-grade citizen,,living on the streetsnor in a horrible makeshift camp,with a stupid, racist namenlike "The Jungle,",most of us would be willingnto do just about anything.,If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz,the second they stepped into the freezingnwaters of the English Channel,,they would probably say,n"This is worth the risk,",because they couldnno longer see any other option.,And that's desperation,,but that's the reality of livingnas a refugee in Western Europe in 2015. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.,This is Tomm Christiansen,,who took most of the pictures you havenseen and they've done reporting together.,Tomm, you two have beennback to Calais recently.,This was the third trip.,It was after the publicationnof the article.,What has changed?nWhat have you seen there? 
 Tomm Christiansen:nThe first time we were in Calais,,it was about 1,500 refugees there.,They had a difficult time,nbut they were positive, they had hope.,The last time, the camp has grown,nmaybe four or five thousand people.,It seemed more permanent,nNGOs have arrived,,a small school has opened.,But the thing is that the refugeesnhave stayed for a longer time,,and the French government has managednto seal off the borders better,,so now The Jungle is growing,,along with the despairnand hopelessness among the refugees. 
 BG: Are you planning to go back?nAnd continue the reporting? 
 TC: Yes. 
 BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,,and to me, it's amazingnthat in the current climate,of slashing budgetsnand publishers in crisis,,Dagbladet has consentednso many resources for this story,,which tells a lot about newspapersntaking the responsibility,,but how did you sell it to your editors? 
 Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,,because we weren't able to knownwhat we actually could figure out.,As soon as it became clear,that we actually could be ablento identify who the first one was,,we basically got the messagenthat we could do whatever we wanted,,just travel wherever you need to go,ndo whatever you need to do,,just get this done. 
 BG: That's an editorntaking responsibility.,The story, by the way,nhas been translated and published,across several European countries,nand certainly will continue to do.,And we want to read the updates from you.nThank you Anders. Thank you Tomm. 
 (Applause)It's often said that you can tellna lot about a person,by looking at what's on their bookshelves.,What do my bookshelves say about me?,Well, when I asked myselfnthis question a few years ago,,I made an alarming discovery.,I'd always thought of myselfnas a fairly cultured,,cosmopolitan sort of person.,But my bookshelves toldna rather different story.,Pretty much all the titles on them,were by British or North American authors,,and there was almostnnothing in translation.,Discovering this massive,ncultural blind spot in my reading,came as quite a shock. 
 And when I thought about it,nit seemed like a real shame.,I knew there had to be lotsnof amazing stories out there,by writers working in languagesnother than English.,And it seemed really sad to thinknthat my reading habits meant,I would probably never encounter them.,So, I decided to prescribe myself,an intensive course of global reading.,2012 was set to be a veryninternational year for the UK;,it was the year of the London Olympics.,And so I decided to use itnas my time frame,to try to read a novel,nshort story collection,or memoir from every country in the world.,And so I did.,And it was very exciting,and I learned some remarkable things,and made some wonderful connections,that I want to share with you today. 
 But it started with somenpractical problems.,After I'd worked out which of the manyndifferent lists of countries in the world,to use for my project,,I ended up going with the listnof UN-recognized nations,,to which I added Taiwan,,which gave me a total of 196 countries.,And after I'd worked outnhow to fit reading and blogging,about, roughly, four books a week,around working five days a week, 
 I then had to face up to the factnthat I might even not be able,to get books in Englishnfrom every country.,Only around 4.5 percentnof the literary works published,each year in the UK are translations,,and the figures are similar for muchnof the English-speaking world.,Although, the proportionnof translated books published,in many other countries is a lot higher.,4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,,but what that figure doesn't tell you,is that many of those booksnwill come from countries,with strong publishing networks,and lots of industry professionalsnprimed to go out and sell those titles,to English-language publishers.,So, for example, although well over 100nbooks are translated from French,and published in the UK each year,,most of them will come from countriesnlike France or Switzerland.,French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,,will rarely ever get a look-in. 
 The upshot is that there arenactually quite a lot of nations,that may have little or even noncommercially available literature,in English.,Their books remain invisible to readers,of the world's most published language.,But when it came to reading the world,,the biggest challenge of all for me,was that fact that I didn'tnknow where to start.,Having spent my life readingnalmost exclusively British,and North American books,,I had no idea how to go aboutnsourcing and finding stories,and choosing them from muchnof the rest of the world.,I couldn't tell you how to sourcena story from Swaziland.,I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.,There was no hiding it --,I was a clueless literary xenophobe.,So how on earth was Ingoing to read the world? 
 I was going to have to ask for help.,So in October 2011, I registered my blog,,ayearofreadingtheworld.com,,and I posted a short appeal online.,I explained who I was,,how narrow my reading had been,,and I asked anyone who cared to,to leave a message suggestingnwhat I might read,from other parts of the planet.,Now, I had no idea whethernanyone would be interested,,but within a few hoursnof me posting that appeal online,,people started to get in touch.,At first, it was friends and colleagues.,Then it was friends of friends.,And pretty soon, it was strangers. 
 Four days after I put that appeal online,,I got a message from a womanncalled Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.,She said she lovednthe sound of my project,,could she go to her localnEnglish-language bookshop,and choose my Malaysian booknand post it to me?,I accepted enthusiastically,,and a few weeks later,,a package arrived containingnnot one, but two books --,Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,,and a book from Singaporenthat she had also picked out for me.,Now, at the time, I was amazed,that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away,would go to such lengths to help someone,she would probably never meet. 
 But Rafidah's kindness provednto be the pattern for that year.,Time and again, people wentnout of their way to help me.,Some took on research on my behalf,,and others made detoursnon holidays and business trips,to go to bookshops for me.,It turns out, if you wantnto read the world,,if you want to encounter itnwith an open mind,,the world will help you.,When it came to countries,with little or no commerciallynavailable literature in English,,people went further still. 
 Books often came from surprising sources.,My Panamanian read, for example,ncame through a conversation,I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.,Yes, the Panama Canalnhas a Twitter account.,And when I tweeted at it about my project,,it suggested that I might like to trynand get hold of the work,of the Panamanian authornJuan David Morgan.,I found Morgan's websitenand I sent him a message,,asking if any of hisnSpanish-language novels,had been translated into English.,And he said that nothingnhad been published,,but he did have an unpublished translation,of his novel "The Golden Horse.",He emailed this to me,,allowing me to becomenone of the first people ever,to read that book in English. 
 Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith,to share his work with me in this way.,From Sweden to Palau,,writers and translatorsnsent me self-published books,and unpublished manuscripts of books,that hadn't been pickednup by Anglophone publishers,or that were no longer available,,giving me privileged glimpsesnof some remarkable imaginary worlds.,I read, for example,,about the Southern African kingnNgungunhane, who led the resistance,against the Portuguesenin the 19th century;,and about marriage ritualsnin a remote village,on the shores of the Caspian seanin Turkmenistan.,I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I read about an orgynin a tree in Angola. 
 But perhaps the most amazing example,of the lengths that peoplenwere prepared to go to,to help me read the world,,came towards the end of my quest,,when I tried to get hold of a booknfrom the tiny, Portuguese-speaking,African island nationnof São Tomé and Príncipe.,Now, having spent several monthsntrying everything I could think of to find,a book that had been translatedninto English from the nation,,it seemed as thoughnthe only option left to me,was to see if I could get somethingntranslated for me from scratch.,Now, I was really dubious,whether anyone was goingnto want to help with this,,and give up their timenfor something like that.,But, within a week of me puttingna call out on Twitter and Facebook,for Portuguese speakers,,I had more people than I couldninvolve in the project,,including Margaret Jull Costa,na leader in her field,,who has translated the worknof Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.,With my nine volunteers in place,,I managed to find a booknby a São Toméan author,that I could buy enough copies of online.,Here's one of them.,And I sent a copy outnto each of my volunteers.,They all took on a couplenof short stories from this collection,,stuck to their word, sentntheir translations back to me,,and within six weeks,nI had the entire book to read. 
 In that case, as I found so oftennduring my year of reading the world,,my not knowing and being opennabout my limitations,had become a big opportunity.,When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,,it was a chance not onlynto learn something new,and discover a new collection of stories,,but also to bring togetherna group of people,and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.,My weakness had becomenthe project's strength. 
 The books I read that yearnopened my eyes to many things.,As those who enjoy reading will know,,books have an extraordinary powernto take you out of yourself,and into someone else's mindset,,so that, for a while at least,,you look at the worldnthrough different eyes.,That can be an uncomfortable experience,,particularly if you're reading a book,from a culture that may have quitendifferent values to your own.,But it can also be really enlightening.,Wrestling with unfamiliar ideasncan help clarify your own thinking.,And it can also show up blind spots,in the way you might havenbeen looking at the world. 
 When I looked back at muchnof the English-language literature,I'd grown up with, for example,,I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,,compared to the richnessnthat the world has to offer.,And as the pages turned,,something else started to happen, too.,Little by little,,that long list of countries thatnI'd started the year with, changed,from a rather dry, academicnregister of place names,into living, breathing entities. 
 Now, I don't want to suggestnthat it's at all possible,to get a rounded picture of a countrynsimply by reading one book.,But cumulatively, the storiesnI read that year,made me more alive than ever before,to the richness, diversity and complexitynof our remarkable planet.,It was as though the world's stories,and the people who'd gonento such lengths to help me read them,had made it real to me.,These days, when I look at my bookshelves,or consider the works on my e-reader,,they tell a rather different story.,It's the story of the powernbooks have to connect us,across political, geographical,ncultural, social, religious divides.,It's the tale of the potentialnhuman beings have to work together. 
 And, it's testament,to the extraordinary times we livenin, where, thanks to the Internet,,it's easier than ever before,for a stranger to share a story,na worldview, a book,with someone she may never meet,non the other side of the planet.,I hope it's a story I'm readingnfor many years to come.,And I hope many more people will join me.,If we all read more widely,nthere'd be more incentive,for publishers to translate more books,,and we would all be richer for that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A few years ago,nI broke into my own house.,I had just driven home,,it was around midnightnin the dead of Montreal winter,,I had been visiting my friend,nJeff, across town,,and the thermometer on the front porchnread minus 40 degrees --,and don't bother askingnif that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,,minus 40 is where the two scales meet --,it was very cold.,And as I stood on the front porchnfumbling in my pockets,,I found I didn't have my keys.,In fact, I could see themnthrough the window,,lying on the dining room tablenwhere I had left them.,So I quickly ran aroundnand tried all the other doors and windows,,and they were locked tight.,I thought about calling a locksmith --nat least I had my cellphone,,but at midnight, it could take a whilenfor a locksmith to show up,,and it was cold.,I couldn't go back to my friendnJeff's house for the night,because I had an early flightnto Europe the next morning,,and I needed to getnmy passport and my suitcase. 
 So, desperate and freezing cold,,I found a large rock and I brokenthrough the basement window,,cleared out the shards of glass,,I crawled through,,I found a piece of cardboardnand taped it up over the opening,,figuring that in the morning,non the way to the airport,,I could call my contractornand ask him to fix it.,This was going to be expensive,,but probably no more expensiventhan a middle-of-the-night locksmith,,so I figured, under the circumstances,nI was coming out even. 
 Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training,and I know a little bitnabout how the brain performs under stress.,It releases cortisolnthat raises your heart rate,,it modulates adrenaline levels,and it clouds your thinking.,So the next morning,,when I woke up on too little sleep,,worrying about the hole in the window,,and a mental notenthat I had to call my contractor,,and the freezing temperatures,,and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,,and, you know, with allnthe cortisol in my brain,,my thinking was cloudy,,but I didn't know it was cloudynbecause my thinking was cloudy. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it wasn't until I gotnto the airport check-in counter,,that I realized I didn't have my passport. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I raced home in the snownand ice, 40 minutes,,got my passport,nraced back to the airport,,I made it just in time,,but they had given awaynmy seat to someone else,,so I got stuck in the back of the plane,nnext to the bathrooms,,in a seat that wouldn't recline,non an eight-hour flight.,Well, I had a lot of time to thinknduring those eight hours and no sleep. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I started wondering,nare there things that I can do,,systems that I can put into place,,that will prevent bad thingsnfrom happening?,Or at least if bad things happen,,will minimize the likelihoodnof it being a total catastrophe.,So I started thinking about that,,but my thoughts didn't crystallizenuntil about a month later.,I was having dinner with my colleague,nDanny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,,and I somewhat embarrassedly told himnabout having broken my window,,and, you know, forgotten my passport,,and Danny shared with me,that he'd been practicingnsomething called prospective hindsight. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's something that he had gottennfrom the psychologist Gary Klein,,who had written about itna few years before,,also called the pre-mortem.,Now, you all know what the postmortem is.,Whenever there's a disaster,,a team of experts come in and they trynto figure out what went wrong, right?,Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,,you look ahead and you try to figure outnall the things that could go wrong,,and then you try to figure outnwhat you can do,to prevent those things from happening,nor to minimize the damage. 
 So what I want to talk to you about today,are some of the things we can donin the form of a pre-mortem.,Some of them are obvious,nsome of them are not so obvious.,I'll start with the obvious ones. 
 Around the home, designate a placenfor things that are easily lost.,Now, this soundsnlike common sense, and it is,,but there's a lot of sciencento back this up,,based on the way our spatial memory works.,There's a structure in the brainncalled the hippocampus,,that evolved over tensnof thousands of years,,to keep track of the locationsnof important things --,where the well is,nwhere fish can be found,,that stand of fruit trees,,where the friendly and enemy tribes live.,The hippocampus is the part of the brain,that in London taxicab driversnbecomes enlarged.,It's the part of the brainnthat allows squirrels to find their nuts.,And if you're wondering,nsomebody actually did the experiment,where they cut offnthe olfactory sense of the squirrels,,and they could still find their nuts.,They weren't using smell,nthey were using the hippocampus,,this exquisitely evolved mechanismnin the brain for finding things.,But it's really good for thingsnthat don't move around much,,not so good for things that move around.,So this is why we lose car keysnand reading glasses and passports.,So in the home,ndesignate a spot for your keys --,a hook by the door,nmaybe a decorative bowl.,For your passport, a particular drawer.,For your reading glasses,na particular table.,If you designate a spotnand you're scrupulous about it,,your things will always be therenwhen you look for them. 
 What about travel?,Take a cell phone picturenof your credit cards,,your driver's license, your passport,,mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.,If these things are lost or stolen,nyou can facilitate replacement. 
 Now these are some rather obvious things.,Remember, when you're under stress,nthe brain releases cortisol.,Cortisol is toxic,nand it causes cloudy thinking.,So part of the practice of the pre-mortem,is to recognize that under stressnyou're not going to be at your best,,and you should put systems in place. 
 And there's perhapsnno more stressful a situation,than when you're confrontednwith a medical decision to make.,And at some point, all of usnare going to be in that position,,where we have to makena very important decision,about the future of our medical carenor that of a loved one,,to help them with a decision. 
 And so I want to talk about that.,And I'm going to talk aboutna very particular medical condition.,But this stands as a proxy for all kindsnof medical decision-making,,and indeed for financial decision-making,nand social decision-making --,any kind of decision you have to make,that would benefit from a rationalnassessment of the facts. 
 So suppose you go to your doctornand the doctor says,,"I just got your lab work back,nyour cholesterol's a little high.",Now, you all know that high cholesterol,is associated with an increased risknof cardiovascular disease,,heart attack, stroke.,And so you're thinking,having high cholesterolnisn't the best thing,,and so the doctor says,n"You know, I'd like to give you a drug,that will help younlower your cholesterol, a statin.",And you've probably heard of statins,,you know that they're amongnthe most widely prescribed drugs,in the world today,,you probably even knownpeople who take them.,And so you're thinking,n"Yeah! Give me the statin." 
 But there's a questionnyou should ask at this point,,a statistic you should ask for,that most doctorsndon't like talking about,,and pharmaceutical companiesnlike talking about even less.,It's for the number needed to treat.,Now, what is this, the NNT?,It's the number of peoplenthat need to take a drug,or undergo a surgerynor any medical procedure,before one person is helped.,And you're thinking,nwhat kind of crazy statistic is that?,The number should be one.,My doctor wouldn't prescribensomething to me,if it's not going to help.,But actually, medical practicendoesn't work that way.,And it's not the doctor's fault,,if it's anybody's fault,nit's the fault of scientists like me.,We haven't figured outnthe underlying mechanisms well enough.,But GlaxoSmithKline estimates,that 90 percent of the drugs worknin only 30 to 50 percent of the people.,So the number needed to treatnfor the most widely prescribed statin,,what do you suppose it is?,How many people have to take itnbefore one person is helped?,300.,This is according to research,by research practitionersnJerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,,independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.,I ran through the numbers myself.,300 people have tontake the drug for a year,before one heart attack, strokenor other adverse event is prevented. 
 Now you're probably thinking,,"Well, OK, one in 300 chancenof lowering my cholesterol.,Why not, doc? Give menthe prescription anyway.",But you should ask at this pointnfor another statistic,,and that is, "Tell menabout the side effects." Right?,So for this particular drug,,the side effects occurnin five percent of the patients.,And they include terrible things --,debilitating muscle and joint pain,ngastrointestinal distress --,but now you're thinking, "Five percent,,not very likelynit's going to happen to me,,I'll still take the drug.",But wait a minute.,Remember under stressnyou're not thinking clearly.,So think about how you're goingnto work through this ahead of time,,so you don't have to manufacturenthe chain of reasoning on the spot.,300 people take the drug, right?nOne person's helped,,five percent of those 300nhave side effects,,that's 15 people.,You're 15 times more likelynto be harmed by the drug,than you are to be helped by the drug. 
 Now, I'm not saying whether younshould take the statin or not.,I'm just saying you should haventhis conversation with your doctor.,Medical ethics requires it,,it's part of the principlenof informed consent.,You have the right to have accessnto this kind of information,to begin the conversation about whethernyou want to take the risks or not. 
 Now you might be thinking,I've pulled this numbernout of the air for shock value,,but in fact it's rather typical,nthis number needed to treat.,For the most widely performed surgerynon men over the age of 50,,removal of the prostate for cancer,,the number needed to treat is 49.,That's right, 49 surgeries are donenfor every one person who's helped.,And the side effects in that casenoccur in 50 percent of the patients.,They include impotence,nerectile dysfunction,,urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,,fecal incontinence.,And if you're lucky, and you're onenof the 50 percent who has these,,they'll only last for a year or two. 
 So the idea of the pre-mortemnis to think ahead of time,to the questionsnthat you might be able to ask,that will push the conversation forward.,You don't want to have to manufacturenall of this on the spot.,And you also want to thinknabout things like quality of life.,Because you have a choice oftentimes,,do you I want a shorter lifenthat's pain-free,,or a longer life that might havena great deal of pain towards the end?,These are things to talk aboutnand think about now,,with your family and your loved ones.,You might change your mindnin the heat of the moment,,but at least you're practicednwith this kind of thinking. 
 Remember, our brain under stressnreleases cortisol,,and one of the thingsnthat happens at that moment,is a whole bunch on systems shut down.,There's an evolutionary reason for this.,Face-to-face with a predator,nyou don't need your digestive system,,or your libido, or your immune system,,because if you're body is expendingnmetabolism on those things,and you don't react quickly,,you might become the lion's lunch,nand then none of those things matter.,Unfortunately,,one of the things that goes out the windownduring those times of stress,is rational, logical thinking,,as Danny Kahnemannand his colleagues have shown.,So we need to train ourselvesnto think ahead,to these kinds of situations. 
 I think the important point herenis recognizing that all of us are flawed.,We all are going to fail now and then.,The idea is to think aheadnto what those failures might be,,to put systems in placenthat will help minimize the damage,,or to prevent the bad thingsnfrom happening in the first place. 
 Getting back to thatnsnowy night in Montreal,,when I got back from my trip,,I had my contractor installna combination lock next to the door,,with a key to the front door in it,nan easy to remember combination.,And I have to admit,,I still have piles of mailnthat haven't been sorted,,and piles of emailsnthat I haven't gone through.,So I'm not completely organized,,but I see organizationnas a gradual process,,and I'm getting there. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I would like to invite you,to come along on a visit,to a dark continent.,It is the continent hidden,under the surface of the earth.,It is largely unexplored,,poorly understood,nand the stuff of legends.,But it is made also of dramatic landscapes,like this huge underground chamber,,and it is rich with surprisingnbiological and mineralogical worlds. 
 Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagersnin the last three centuries --,actually, we know also thanksnto satellite technology, of course --,we know almost every single square meternof our planet's surface.,However, we know still very littlenabout what is hidden inside the earth.,Because a cave landscape,nlike this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,,the potential of cave exploration --nthe geographical dimension --,is poorly understood and unappreciated.,Because we are creaturesnliving on the surface,,our perception of the innernside of the planet,is in some ways skewed,,as is that of the depth of the oceans,or of the upper atmosphere. 
 However, since systematic cave explorationnstarted about one century ago,,we know actually that caves existnin every continent of the world.,A single cave system,nlike Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,,can be as longnas more than 600 kilometers.,And an abyss like Krubera Voronya,nwhich is in the Caucasus region,,actually the deepest cavenexplored in the world,,can go as far as more than 2,000nmeters below the surface.,That means a journey of weeksnfor a cave explorer. 
 Caves form in karstic regions.,So karstic regions are areas of the world,where the infiltrating waternalong cracks, fractures,,can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,,forming a drainage systemnof tunnels, conduits --,a three-dimensional network, actually.,Karstic regions cover almost 20 percentnof the continents' surface,,and we know actually that speleologistsnin the last 50 years,have explored roughly 30,000 kilometersnof cave passages around the world,,which is a big number.,But geologists have estimatednthat what is still missing,,to be discovered and mapped,,is something around 10 million kilometers. 
 That means that for each meternof a cave that we already know,,that we have explored,,there are still some tens of kilometersnof undiscovered passages.,That means that this is reallynan endless continent,,and we will never be ablento explore it completely.,And this estimation is madenwithout considering other types of caves,,like, for example, inside glaciersnor even volcanic caves,,which are not karstic,nbut are formed by lava flows.,And if we have a look at other planetsnlike, for example, Mars,,you will see that this characteristic,is not so specific of our home planet.,However, I will show to you nownthat we do not need to go to Mars,to explore alien worlds. 
 I'm a speleologist, that meansna cave explorer.,And I started with this passionnwhen I was really young,in the mountains not farnfrom my hometown in North Italy,,in the karstic regions of the Alpsnand the Dolomites.,But soon, the quest for explorationnbrought me to the farthest corner,of the planet, searchingnfor new potential entrances,of this undiscovered continent.,And in 2009, I had the opportunitynto visit the tepui table mountains,,which are in the Orinoconand Amazon basins.,These massifs enchanted menfrom the first time I saw them.,They are surrounded by vertical,nvertiginous rock walls,with silvery waterfallsnthat are lost in the forest.,They really inspired in mena sense of wilderness,,with a soul older than millionsnand millions of years.,And this dramatic landscapeninspired among other things,also Conan Doyle'sn"The Lost World" novel in 1912.,And they are, really, a lost world.,Scientists consider those mountainsnas islands in time,,being separatednfrom the surrounding lowlands,since tens of millions of years ago.,They are surroundednby up to 1,000-meter-high walls,,resembling a fortress,nimpregnable by humans.,And, in fact, only a fewnof these mountains have been climbed,and explored on their top. 
 These mountains contain alsona scientific paradox:,They are made by quartz,,which is a very common mineralnon the earth's crust,,and the rock made up by quartznis called quartzite,,and quartzite is one of the hardestnand least soluble minerals on earth.,So we do not expect at allnto find a cave there.,Despite this, in the last 10 years,nspeleologists from Italy,,Slovakia, Czech Republic,nand, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,,have explored several caves in this area.,So how can it be possible? 
 To understand this contradiction,nwe have to consider the time factor,,because the history of the tepuisnis extremely long,,starting about 1.6 billion years agonwith the formation of the rock,,and then evolving with the upliftnof the region 150 million years ago,,after the disruptionnof the Pangaea supercontinent,and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.,So you can imagine that the water had tensnor even hundreds of millions of years,to sculpt the strangest formsnon the tepuis' surfaces,,but also to open the fracturesnand form stone cities, rock cities,,fields of towers which are characterizednin the famous landscape of the tepuis.,But nobody could have imagined,what was happening inside a mountainnin so long a time frame. 
 And so I was focusing in 2010non one of those massifs,,the Auyán-tepui, which is very famousnbecause it hosts Angel Falls,,which is the highestnwaterfall in the world --,about 979 meters of vertical drop.,And I was searching for hintsnof the existence of cave systems,through satellite images,,and finally we identified an areanof collapses of the surface --,so, big boulders, rock piles --,and that means that therenwas a void below.,It was a clear indication that therenwas something inside the mountain. 
 So we did several attemptsnto reach this area,,by land and with a helicopter,,but it was really difficultnbecause -- you have to imagine,that these mountains are coverednby clouds most of the year, by fog.,There are strong winds,,and there are almost 4,000 millimetersnof rainfall per year,,so it's really, really difficultnto find good conditions.,And only in 2013 we finallynlanded on the spot,and we startednthe exploration of the cave. 
 The cave is huge.,It's a huge network under the surfacenof the tepui plateau,,and in only ten days of expedition,,we explored more than 20 kilometersnof cave passages.,And it's a huge networknof underground rivers,,channels, big rooms,nextremely deep shafts. 
 So it's really an incredible place.,And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.,That means, in the Pemón indigenousnlanguage, "The House of the Gods.",You have to imagine that indigenous peoplenhave never been there.,It was impossible for themnto reach this area.,However, there were legendsnabout the existence,of a cave in the mountain.,So when we started the exploration,,we had to explore with a great respect,,both because of the religious beliefsnof the indigenous people,,but also becausenit was really a sacred place,,because no human had entered there before.,So we had to use special protocols,to not contaminate the environmentnwith our presence,,and we tried also to sharenwith the community,,with the indigenous community,nour discoveries. 
 And the caves represent, really,na snapshot of the past.,The time needed for their formation,could be as long as 50 or evenn100 million years,,which makes them possibly the oldest cavesnthat we can explore on earth.,What you can find therenis really evidence of a lost world. 
 When you enter a quartzite cave,,you have to completely forgetnwhat you know about caves --,classic limestone cavesnor the touristic caves,that you can visitnin several places in the world.,Because what seemsna simple stalactite here,is not made by calcium carbonate,nbut is made by opal,,and one of those stalactites can requirentens of millions of years to be formed.,But you can find even stranger forms,nlike these mushrooms of silica,growing on a boulder.,And you can imagine our talksnwhen we were exploring the cave.,We were the first enteringnand discovering those unknown things,,things like those monster eggs.,And we were a bit scarednbecause it was all a discovery,,and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.,We didn't find a dinosaur. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, actually, we knownthat this kind of formation,,after several studies,,we know that these kinds of formationsnare living organisms.,They are bacterial colonies using silicanto build mineral structures,resembling stromatolites.,Stromatolites are some of the oldestnforms of life that we can find on earth.,And here in the tepuis,,the interesting thing is that thesenbacteria colonies have evolved,in complete isolationnfrom the external surface,,and without being in contact with humans.,They have never beennin contact with humans.,So the implicationsnfor science are enormous,,because here you could find,nfor example, microbes,that could be useful to resolvendiseases in medicine,,or you could find even a new kindnof material with unknown properties.,And, in fact, we discovered in the cavena new mineral structure for science,,which is rossiantonite,na phosphate-sulfate. 
 So whatever you find in the cave,neven a small cricket,,has evolved in the darknin complete isolation.,And, really, everything that you can feelnin the cave are real connections,between the biologicalnand the mineralogical world.,So as we explore this dark continent,and discover its mineralogicalnand biological diversity and uniqueness,,we will find probably cluesnabout the origin of life on our planet,and on the relationshipnand evolution of life,in relationship with the mineral world.,What seems only a dark, empty environment,could be in reality a chest of wonders,full of useful information. 
 With a team of Italian, Venezuelannand Brazilian speleologists,,which is called La Venta Teraphosa,,we will be back soon to Latin America,,because we want to explore other tepuisnin the farthest areas of the Amazon.,There are still very unknown mountains,,like Marahuaca, which is almostn3,000 meters high above sea level,,or Aracà, which is in the upper regionnof Rio Negro in Brazil.,And we suppose that we could find thereneven bigger cave systems,,and each one with its ownnundiscovered world. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.nGive me that to start so we don't forget.,Francesco, you said we don't neednto go to Mars to find alien life,,and indeed, last time we spoke,nyou were in Sardinia,and you were training European astronauts.,So what do you, a speleologist,ntell and teach to the astronauts? 
 Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --nit's a program of training,for not only European, but also NASA,nRoskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.,So they stay in a cavenfor about one week in isolation.,They have to work togethernin a real, real dangerous environment,,and it's a real alien environment for themnbecause it's unusual.,It's always dark. They have to do science.nThey have a lot of tasks.,And it's very similar to a journey to Mars,or the International Space Station. 
 BG: In principle.nFS: Yes. 
 BG: I want to go backnto one of the pictures,that was in your slide show,,and it's just representativenof the other photos -- 
 Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah? 
 Audience: Yeah! 
 (Applause) 
 FS: I have to thank the photographersnfrom the team La Venta,,because all of those photosnare from the photographers. 
 BG: You bring, actually, photographersnwith you in the expedition.,They're professionals,nthey're speleologists and photographers.,But when I look at these pictures,nI wonder: there is zero light down there,,and yet they look incredibly well-exposed.,How do you take these pictures?,How do your colleagues,nthe photographers, take these pictures? 
 FS: Yeah. They are workingnin a darkroom, basically,,so you can open the shutter of the camera,and use the lightsnto paint the environment. 
 BG: So you're basically -- 
 FS: Yes. You can even keepnthe shutter open for one minute,and then paint the environment.,The final result is whatnyou want to achieve. 
 BG: You spray the environment with lightnand that's what you get.,Maybe we can try this at homensomeday, I don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: Francesco, grazie.nFS: Grazie. 
 (Applause)I would like to invite you,to come along on a visit,to a dark continent.,It is the continent hidden,under the surface of the earth.,It is largely unexplored,,poorly understood,nand the stuff of legends.,But it is made also of dramatic landscapes,like this huge underground chamber,,and it is rich with surprisingnbiological and mineralogical worlds. 
 Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagersnin the last three centuries --,actually, we know also thanksnto satellite technology, of course --,we know almost every single square meternof our planet's surface.,However, we know still very littlenabout what is hidden inside the earth.,Because a cave landscape,nlike this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,,the potential of cave exploration --nthe geographical dimension --,is poorly understood and unappreciated.,Because we are creaturesnliving on the surface,,our perception of the innernside of the planet,is in some ways skewed,,as is that of the depth of the oceans,or of the upper atmosphere.

 BG: Francesco, grazie.nFS: Grazie. 
 (Applause)I would like to demonstratenfor the first time in public,that it is possible to transmit a video,from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp,to a solar cell with a laptopnacting as a receiver.,There is no Wi-Fi involved,nit's just light. 
 And you may wonder, what's the point?,And the point is this:,There will be a massivenextension of the Internet,to close the digital divide,,and also to allow for what we calln"The Internet of Things" --,tens of billions of devicesnconnected to the Internet. 
 In my view, such an extensionnof the Internet can only work,if it's almost energy-neutral.,This means we need to use existingninfrastructure as much as possible.,And this is where the solar cellnand the LED come in. 
 I demonstrated for the first time,,at TED in 2011,,Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.,Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDsnto transmit data incredibly fast,,and also in a safe and secure manner.,Data is transported by the light,,encoded in subtle changesnof the brightness.,If we look around,nwe have many LEDs around us,,so there's a rich infrastructurenof Li-Fi transmitters around us.,But so far, we have been usingnspecial devices -- small photo detectors,,to receive the informationnencoded in the data.,I wanted to find a way to also usenexisting infrastructure,to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.,And this is why I have been looking intonsolar cells and solar panels. 
 A solar cell absorbs lightnand converts it into electrical energy.,This is why we can use a solar cellnto charge our mobile phone.,But now we need to remember,that the data is encoded in subtle changesnof the brightness of the LED,,so if the incoming light fluctuates,,so does the energy harvestednfrom the solar cell.,This means we havena principal mechanism in place,to receive information from the lightnand by the solar cell,,because the fluctuationsnof the energy harvested,correspond to the data transmitted. 
 Of course the question is:,can we receive very fast and subtlenchanges of the brightness,,such as the ones transmittednby our LED lights?,And the answer to that is yes, we can.,We have shown in the lab,that we can receive up to 50nmegabytes per second,from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.,And this is faster than mostnbroadband connections these days. 
 Now let me show you in practice.,In this box is a standard,noff-the-shelf LED lamp.,This is a standard,noff-the-shelf solar cell;,it is connected to the laptop.,And also we have an instrument here,to visualize the energynwe harvest from the solar cell.,And this instrument showsnsomething at the moment.,This is because the solar cell alreadynharvests light from the ambient light. 
 Now what I would like to do firstnis switch on the light,,and I'll simply, only switch on the light,,for a moment,,and what you'll notice is thatnthe instrument jumps to the right.,So the solar cell, for a moment,,is harvesting energynfrom this artificial light source.,If I turn it off, we see it drops.,I turn it on ...,So we harvest energy with the solar cell. 
 But next I would like to activatenthe streaming of the video.,And I've done thisnby pressing this button.,So now this LED lamp herenis streaming a video,by changing the brightness of the LEDnin a very subtle way,,and in a way that you can'tnrecognize with your eye,,because the changesnare too fast to recognize.,But in order to prove the point,,I can block the light of the solar cell.,So first you noticenthe energy harvesting drops,and the video stops as well.,If I remove the blockage,nthe video will restart. 
 (Applause) 
 And I can repeat that.,So we stop the transmission of the videonand energy harvesting stops as well.,So that is to show that the solar cellnacts as a receiver. 
 But now imagine that this LED lampnis a street light, and there's fog.,And so I want to simulate fog,,and that's why I broughtna handkerchief with me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And let me put the handkerchiefnover the solar cell.,First you notice,the energy harvested drops, as expected,,but now the video still continues.,This means, despite the blockage,,there's sufficient light coming throughnthe handkerchief to the solar cell,,so that the solar cell is able to decodenand stream that information,,in this case, a high-definition video. 
 What's really important here is thatna solar cell has become a receiver,for high-speed wireless signalsnencoded in light,,while it maintains its primary functionnas an energy-harvesting device.,That's why it is possible,to use existing solar cellsnon the roof of a hut,to act as a broadband receiver,from a laser station on a close by hill,nor indeed, lamp post. 
 And It really doesn't matternwhere the beam hits the solar cell.,And the same is true,for translucent solar cellsnintegrated into windows,,solar cells integratedninto street furniture,,or indeed, solar cells integratedninto these billions of devices,that will form the Internet of Things.,Because simply,,we don't want to chargenthese devices regularly,,or worse, replace the batteriesnevery few months. 
 As I said to you,,this is the first timenI've shown this in public.,It's very much a lab demonstration,,a prototype.,But my team and I are confidentnthat we can take this to market,within the next two to three years.,And we hope we will be able to contributento closing the digital divide,,and also contribute,to connecting all these billionsnof devices to the Internet.,And all of this without causing,a massive explosionnof energy consumption --,because of the solar cells,nquite the opposite. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to tell you three stories,about the power of relationships,to solve the deep and complexnsocial problems of this century. 
 You know, sometimes it seemsnlike all these problems,of poverty, inequality, ill health,nunemployment, violence, addiction --,they're right there in one person's life.,So I want to tell you about someonenlike this that I know.,I'm going to call her Ella.,Ella lives in a British citynon a run down estate.,The shops are closed, the pub's gone,,the playground's pretty desolatenand never used,,and inside Ella's house,nthe tension is palpable,and the noise levels are deafening.,The TV's on at full volume.,One of her sons is fightingnwith one of her daughters.,Another son, Ryan, is keeping up thisnconstant stream of abuse from the kitchen,,and the dogs are lockednbehind the bedroom door and straining.,Ella is stuck.,She has lived with crisis for 40 years.,She knows nothing else,nand she knows no way out.,She's had a whole seriesnof abusive partners,,and, tragically, one of her children hasnbeen taken into care by social services.,The three childrennthat still live with her,suffer from a whole range of problems,nand none of them are in education.,And Ella says to me that shenis repeating the cycle,of her own mother's life before her. 
 But when I met Ella,nthere were 73 different services,on offer for her and her familynin the city where she lives,,73 different servicesnrun out of 24 departments in one city,,and Ella and her partners and her childrennwere known to most of them.,They think nothing of callingnsocial services,to try and mediate one of the manynarguments that broke out.,And the family home was visitednon a regular basis by social workers,,youth workers, a health officer,na housing officer, a home tutor,and the local policemen.,And the governments saynthat there are 100,000 families,in Britain today like Ella's,,struggling to break the cycle of economic,nsocial and environmental deprivation.,And they also saynthat managing this problem,costs a quarter of a million poundsnper family per year,and yet nothing changes.,None of these well-meaning visitorsnare making a difference. 
 This is a chart we made in the same citynwith another family like Ella's.,This shows 30 years of interventionnin that family's life.,And just as with Ella, not one of theseninterventions is part of an overall plan.,There's no end goal in sight.,None of the interventionsnare dealing with the underlying issues.,These are just containment measures,nways of managing a problem.,One of the policemen says to me,,"Look, I just deliver the messagenand then I leave." 
 So, I've spent time livingnwith families like Ella's,in different parts of the world,,because I want to know: what can we learn,from places where our social institutionsnjust aren't working?,I want to know what it feels likento live in Ella's family.,I want to know what's going onnand what we can do differently. 
 Well, the first thing I learnednis that cost is a really slippery concept.,Because when the government saysnthat a family like Ella's,costs a quarter of a million poundsna year to manage,,what it really means,is that this system costsna quarter of a million pounds a year.,Because not one penny of this moneynactually touches Ella's family,in a way that makes a difference.,Instead, the system is justnlike this costly gyroscope,that spins around the families,nkeeping them stuck at its heart,,exactly where they are. 
 And I also spent timenwith the frontline workers,,and I learned that itnis an impossible situation.,So Tom, who is the social workernfor Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,,has to spend 86 percent of his timenservicing the system:,meetings with colleagues,nfilling out forms,,more meetings with colleaguesnto discuss the forms,,and maybe most shockingly,,the 14 percent of the timenhe has to be with Ryan,is spent getting datanand information for the system.,So he says to Ryan,,"How often have you been smoking?nHave you been drinking?,When did you go to school?",And this kind of interactionnrules out the possibility,of a normal conversation.,It rules out the possibilitynof what's needed,to build a relationshipnbetween Tom and Ryan. 
 When we made this chart,,the frontline workers,nthe professionals --,they stared at it absolutely amazed.,It snaked around the wallsnof their offices.,So many hours, so well meant,nbut ultimately so futile.,And there was this momentnof absolute breakdown,,and then of clarity:,we had to work in a different way. 
 So in a really brave step,nthe leaders of the city where Ella lives,agreed that we could startnby reversing Ryan's ratio.,So everyone who came into contactnwith Ella or a family like Ella's,would spend 80 percent of their timenworking with the families,and only 20 percent servicing the system.,And even more radically,,the families would lead,and they would decide whonwas in a best position to help them.,So Ella and another mother were askednto be part of an interview panel,,to choose from amongstnthe existing professionals,who would work with them.,And many, many people wanted to join us,,because you don't go into this kindnof work to manage a system,,you go in because you cannand you want to make a difference. 
 So Ella and the mother askedneverybody who came through the door,,"What will you do when my sonnstarts kicking me?",And so the first person who comes in says,,"Well, I'll look aroundnfor the nearest exit,and I will back out very slowly,,and if the noise is still going on,nI'll call my supervisor.",And the mothers go,n"You're the system. Get out of here!",And then the next person who comesnis a policeman, and he says,,"Well, I'll tackle your son to the groundnand then I'm not sure what I'll do.",And the mothers say, "Thank you.",So, they chose professionals who confessed,they didn't necessarily have the answers,,who said -- well, they weren'tngoing to talk in jargon.,They showed their human qualitiesnand convinced the mothers,that they would stick with themnthrough thick and thin,,even though they wouldn'tnbe soft with them. 
 So these new teams and the families,were then given a slivernof the former budget,,but they could spend the moneynin any way they chose.,And so one of the familiesnwent out for supper.,They went to McDonald's and they sat downnand they talked and they listened,for the first time in a long time.,Another family asked the team,if they would help them do up their home.,And one mother took the money,and she used it as a floatnto start a social enterprise. 
 And in a really short space of time,,something new started to grow:,a relationship between the teamnand the workers.,And then some remarkablenchanges took place.,Maybe it's not surprising,that the journey for Ella has hadnsome big steps backwards,as well as forwards.,But today, she's completednan IT training course,,she has her first paid job,nher children are back in school,,and the neighbors,,who previously just hoped this familynwould be moved anywhere,except next door to them,,are fine.,They've made some new friendships.,And all the same people have beenninvolved in this transformation --,same families, same workers.,But the relationship between themnhas been supported to change. 
 So I'm telling you about Ellanbecause I think that relationships,are the critical resource we have,in solving some of thesenintractable problems.,But today, our relationshipsnare all but written off,by our politics, our social policies,nour welfare institutions.,And I've learned that thisnreally has to change. 
 So what do I mean by relationships?,I'm talking about the simplenhuman bonds between us,,a kind of authentic sensenof connection, of belonging,,the bonds that make us happy,nthat support us to change,,to be brave like Ellanand try something new.,And, you know, it's no accident,that those who run and worknin the institutions,that are supposed to supportnElla and her family,don't talk about relationships,,because relationships are expresslyndesigned out of a welfare model,that was drawn up in Britainnand exported around the world.,The contemporaries of William Beveridge,,who was the architectnof the first welfare state,and the author of the Beveridge Report,,had little faith in what they callednthe average sensual or emotional man.,Instead, they trusted this ideanof the impersonal system,and the bureaucrat who would be detachednand work in this system.,And the impact of Beveridge,on the way the modern statensees social issues,just can't be underestimated.,The Beveridge Reportnsold over 100,000 copies,in the first weeks of publication alone.,People queued in the rainnon a November night to get hold of a copy,,and it was read across the country,nacross the colonies, across Europe,,across the United States of America,,and it had this huge impact,on the way that welfare statesnwere designed around the globe.,The cultures, the bureaucracies,nthe institutions -- they are global,,and they've come to seemnlike common sense.,They've become so ingrained in us,,that actually we don't evennsee them anymore.,And I think it's really important to saynthat in the 20th century,,they were remarkably successful,nthese institutions.,They led to longer lifespans,nthe eradication of mass disease,,mass housing, almost universal education.,But at the same time,,Beveridge sowed the seedsnof today's challenges. 
 So let me tell you a second story.,What do you think today is a bigger killernthan a lifetime of smoking?,It's loneliness.,According to government statistics,none person over 60 -- one in three --,doesn't speak to or seenanother person in a week.,One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,,doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.,And we're not the only peoplenwith this problem;,this problem touches the wholenof the Western world.,And it's even more acutenin countries like China,,where a process of rapid urbanization,nmass migration, has left older people,alone in the villages.,And so the services that Beveridgendesigned and exported --,they can't address this kind of problem.,Loneliness is like a collectivenrelational challenge,,and it can't be addressednby a traditional bureaucratic response. 
 So some years ago,nwanting to understand this problem,,I started to work with a groupnof about 60 older people,in South London, where I live.,I went shopping, I played bingo,,but mainly I was justnobserving and listening.,I wanted to knownwhat we could do differently.,And if you ask them, people tell younthey want two things.,They want somebody to go up a laddernand change a light bulb,,or to be there when theyncome out of hospital.,They want on-demand, practical support.,And they want to have fun.,They want to go out, do interesting thingsnwith like-minded people,,and make friends like we've allnmade friends at every stage of our lives.,So we rented a phone line,nhired a couple of handymen,,and started a service we called "Circle.",And Circle offers its local membershipna toll-free 0 800 number,that they can call on demandnfor any support.,And people have called usnfor so many reasons.,They've called becausentheir pets are unwell,,their DVD is broken, they've forgottennhow to use their mobile phone,,or maybe they are coming out of hospital,and they want someone to be there.,And Circle also offersna rich social calendar --,knitting, darts, museum tours,nhot air ballooning -- you name it.,But here's the interesting thing,nthe really deep change:,over time, the friendshipsnthat have formed,have begun to replace the practical offer. 
 So let me tell you about Belinda.,Belinda's a Circle member, and she wasngoing into hospital for a hip operation,,so she called her local Circle to saynthey wouldn't see her for a bit.,And Damon, who runs the local Circle,ncalls her back and says, "How can I help?",And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine --,Jocelyn is doing the shopping,nTony's doing the gardening,,Melissa and Joe are goingnto come in and cook and chat.",So five Circle membersnhad organized themselves,to take care of Belinda.,And Belinda's 80, although she saysnthat she feels 25 inside,,but she also says,that she felt stuck and pretty downnwhen she joined Circle.,But the simple act of encouraging hernto come along to that first event,led to a process wherennatural friendships formed,,friendships that today are replacingnthe need for expensive services.,It's relationshipsnthat are making the difference. 
 So I think that three factorsnhave converged,that enable us to put relationshipsnat the heart and center,of how we solve social problems today.,Firstly, the nature of the problems --,they've changed, and they requirendifferent solutions.,Secondly, the cost, human as muchnas financial, of doing business as usual.,And thirdly, technology. 
 I've talked about the first two factors.,It's technology that enablesnthese approaches to scale,and potentially now supportnthousands of people.,So the technology we've usednis really simple,,it's made up of available thingsnlike databases, mobile phones.,Circle has got this very simplensystem that underpins it,,enables a small local team to supportna membership of up to a thousand.,And you can contrast thisnwith a neighborhood organization,of the 1970s,,when this kind of scalenjust wasn't possible,,neither was the quality or the longevitynthat the spine of technology can provide. 
 So it's relationshipsnunderpinned by technology,that can turn the Beveridgenmodels on their heads.,The Beveridge models are allnabout institutions with finite resources,,anonymously managing access.,In my work at the front line,,I've seen again and again hownup to 80 percent of resource,is spent keeping people out.,So professionals have to administer,these increasingly complex formsnof administration,that are basically about stopping peoplenaccessing the service,or managing the queue.,And Circle, like the relational servicesnthat we and others have designed,,inverts this logic.,What it says is, the more people,nthe more relationships,,the stronger the solution.,So I want to tell you my thirdnand final story,,which is about unemployment.,In Britain, as in most placesnin the world,,our welfare states were primarily designed,to get people into work,,to educate them for this,,and to keep them healthy.,But here, too, the systems are failing.,And so the response has been,to try and make these old systemsneven more efficient and transactional --,to speed up processing times, dividenpeople into ever-smaller categories,,try and target services at themnmore efficiently -- in other words,,the very opposite of relational. 
 But guess how most people find work today?,Through word of mouth.,It turns out that in Britain today,nmost new jobs are not advertised.,So it's friends that tell you about a job,,it's friends that recommend you for a job,,and it's a rich and diverse social networknthat helps you find work.,Maybe some of you herenthis evening are thinking,,"But I found my job through an advert,",but if you think back, it was probablyna friend that showed you the ad,and then encouraged you to apply.,But not surprisingly,,people who perhaps most neednthis rich and diverse network,are those who are most isolated from it. 
 So knowing this,,and also knowing about the costsnand failure of current systems,,we designed something newnwith relationships at its heart.,We designed a servicenthat encourages people to meet up,,people in and out of work,,to work together in structured ways,and try new opportunities.,And, well, it's very hard to comparenthe results of these new systems,with the old transactional models,,but it looks like,nwith our first 1,000 members,,we outperformed existing servicesnby a factor of three,,at a fraction of the cost.,And here, too, we've used technology,,but not to network people in the waynthat a social platform would do.,We've used it to bring people face to facenand connect them with each other,,building real relationshipsnand supporting people to find work. 
 At the end of his life, in 1948,,Beveridge wrote a third report.,And in it he said he had madena dreadful mistake.,He had left peoplenand their communities out.,And this omission, he said,nled to seeing people,,and people starting to see themselves,,within the categoriesnof the bureaucracies and the institutions.,And human relationshipsnwere already withering.,But unfortunately, this third reportnwas much less read,than Beveridge's earlier work. 
 But today, we need to bring peoplenand their communities,back into the heart of the waynwe design new systems and new services,,in an approach that I calln"Relational Welfare.",We need to leave behindnthese old, transactional,,unsuitable, outdated models,,and we need to adopt insteadnthe shared collective relational responses,that can support a family like Ella's,,that can address an issue like loneliness,,that can support people into worknand up the skills curve,in a modern labor market,,that can also address challengesnof education, of health care systems,,and so many more of those problemsnthat are pressing on our societies.,It is all about relationships.,Relationships are the criticalnresource we have. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A few years ago,,with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,,I invented a new technologynfor editing genomes.,It's called CRISPR-Cas9.,The CRISPR technology allowsnscientists to make changes,to the DNA in cells,that could allow usnto cure genetic disease. 
 You might be interested to know,that the CRISPR technology came aboutnthrough a basic research project,that was aimed at discoveringnhow bacteria fight viral infections.,Bacteria have to deal with virusesnin their environment,,and we can think about a viral infectionnlike a ticking time bomb --,a bacterium has only a few minutesnto defuse the bomb,before it gets destroyed.,So, many bacteria have in their cellsnan adaptive immune system called CRISPR,,that allows them to detectnviral DNA and destroy it. 
 Part of the CRISPR systemnis a protein called Cas9,,that's able to seek out, cutnand eventually degrade viral DNA,in a specific way.,And it was through our research,to understand the activitynof this protein, Cas9,,that we realized that we couldnharness its function,as a genetic engineering technology --,a way for scientists to delete or insertnspecific bits of DNA into cells,with incredible precision --,that would offer opportunities,to do things that really haven'tnbeen possible in the past. 
 The CRISPR technologynhas already been used,to change the DNA in the cellsnof mice and monkeys,,other organisms as well.,Chinese scientists showed recently,that they could even usenthe CRISPR technology,to change genes in human embryos.,And scientists in Philadelphia showednthey could use CRISPR,to remove the DNAnof an integrated HIV virus,from infected human cells. 
 The opportunity to do this kindnof genome editing,also raises various ethical issuesnthat we have to consider,,because this technology can be employednnot only in adult cells,,but also in the embryos of organisms,,including our own species.,And so, together with my colleagues,,I've called for a global conversationnabout the technology that I co-invented,,so that we can consider all of the ethicalnand societal implications,of a technology like this. 
 What I want to do now is tell younwhat the CRISPR technology is,,what it can do,,where we are today,and why I think we need to takena prudent path forward,in the way that we employ this technology. 
 When viruses infect a cell,nthey inject their DNA.,And in a bacterium,,the CRISPR system allows that DNAnto be plucked out of the virus,,and inserted in little bitsninto the chromosome --,the DNA of the bacterium.,And these integrated bits of viral DNAnget inserted at a site called CRISPR.,CRISPR stands for clustered regularlyninterspaced short palindromic repeats.,(Laughter) 
 A big mouthful -- you can see whynwe use the acronym CRISPR.,It's a mechanism that allows cellsnto record, over time,,the viruses they have been exposed to.,And importantly, those bits of DNAnare passed on to the cells' progeny,,so cells are protected from virusesnnot only in one generation,,but over many generations of cells.,This allows the cellsnto keep a record of infection,,and as my colleague,nBlake Wiedenheft, likes to say,,the CRISPR locus is effectivelyna genetic vaccination card in cells.,Once those bits of DNA have been insertedninto the bacterial chromosome,,the cell then makes a little copynof a molecule called RNA,,which is orange in this picture,,that is an exact replicatenof the viral DNA.,RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,,and it allows interactionnwith DNA molecules,that have a matching sequence. 
 So those little bits of RNAnfrom the CRISPR locus,associate -- they bind --nto protein called Cas9,,which is white in the picture,,and form a complex that functionsnlike a sentinel in the cell.,It searches through allnof the DNA in the cell,,to find sites that matchnthe sequences in the bound RNAs.,And when those sites are found --,as you can see here,nthe blue molecule is DNA --,this complex associates with that DNA,and allows the Cas9 cleavernto cut up the viral DNA.,It makes a very precise break.,So we can think of the Cas9 RNAnsentinel complex,like a pair of scissorsnthat can cut DNA --,it makes a double-stranded breaknin the DNA helix.,And importantly,nthis complex is programmable,,so it can be programmed to recognizenparticular DNA sequences,,and make a break in the DNA at that site. 
 As I'm going to tell you now,,we recognized that that activityncould be harnessed for genome engineering,,to allow cells to makena very precise change to the DNA,at the site wherenthis break was introduced.,That's sort of analogous,to the way that we usena word-processing program,to fix a typo in a document. 
 The reason we envisioned usingnthe CRISPR system for genome engineering,is because cells have the abilitynto detect broken DNA,and repair it.,So when a plant or an animal cell detectsna double-stranded break in its DNA,,it can fix that break,,either by pasting togethernthe ends of the broken DNA,with a little, tiny changenin the sequence of that position,,or it can repair the break by integratingna new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.,So if we have a way to introducendouble-stranded breaks into DNA,at precise places,,we can trigger cellsnto repair those breaks,,by either the disruption or incorporationnof new genetic information.,So if we were able to programnthe CRISPR technology,to make a break in DNA,at the position at or near a mutationncausing cystic fibrosis, for example,,we could trigger cellsnto repair that mutation. 
 Genome engineering is actually not new,nit's been in development since the 1970s.,We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,,for copying DNA,,and even for manipulating DNA.,And these technologiesnwere very promising,,but the problem wasnthat they were either inefficient,,or they were difficult enough to use,that most scientists had not adopted themnfor use in their own laboratories,,or certainly for manynclinical applications.,So, the opportunity to take a technologynlike CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,,because of its relative simplicity.,We can think of olderngenome engineering technologies,as similar to havingnto rewire your computer,each time you want to runna new piece of software,,whereas the CRISPR technologynis like software for the genome,,we can program it easily,nusing these little bits of RNA. 
 So once a double-strandednbreak is made in DNA,,we can induce repair,,and thereby potentially achievenastounding things,,like being able to correct mutationsnthat cause sickle cell anemia,or cause Huntington's Disease.,I actually think that the firstnapplications of the CRISPR technology,are going to happen in the blood,,where it's relatively easiernto deliver this tool into cells,,compared to solid tissues. 
 Right now, a lot of the worknthat's going on,applies to animal modelsnof human disease, such as mice.,The technology is being used to makenvery precise changes,that allow us to study the waynthat these changes in the cell's DNA,affect either a tissue or,nin this case, an entire organism. 
 Now in this example,,the CRISPR technologynwas used to disrupt a gene,by making a tiny change in the DNA,in a gene that is responsiblenfor the black coat color of these mice.,Imagine that these white micendiffer from their pigmented litter-mates,by just a tiny change at one genenin the entire genome,,and they're otherwise completely normal.,And when we sequence the DNAnfrom these animals,,we find that the change in the DNA,has occurred at exactly the placenwhere we induced it,,using the CRISPR technology. 
 Additional experimentsnare going on in other animals,that are useful for creating modelsnfor human disease,,such as monkeys.,And here we findnthat we can use these systems,to test the application of this technologynin particular tissues,,for example, figuring out how to delivernthe CRISPR tool into cells.,We also want to understand better,how to control the waynthat DNA is repaired after it's cut,,and also to figure out how to controlnand limit any kind of off-target,,or unintended effectsnof using the technology. 
 I think that we will seenclinical application of this technology,,certainly in adults,,within the next 10 years.,I think that it's likelynthat we will see clinical trials,and possibly even approvedntherapies within that time,,which is a very exciting thingnto think about.,And because of the excitementnaround this technology,,there's a lot of interestnin start-up companies,that have been foundednto commercialize the CRISPR technology,,and lots of venture capitalists,that have been investingnin these companies. 
 But we have to also consider,that the CRISPR technology can be usednfor things like enhancement.,Imagine that we could trynto engineer humans,that have enhanced properties,nsuch as stronger bones,,or less susceptibilitynto cardiovascular disease,or even to have properties,that we would consider maybento be desirable,,like a different eye colornor to be taller, things like that.,"Designer humans," if you will.,Right now, the genetic information,to understand what types of genesnwould give rise to these traits,is mostly not known.,But it's important to know,that the CRISPR technology gives us a toolnto make such changes,,once that knowledge becomes available. 
 This raises a number of ethical questionsnthat we have to carefully consider,,and this is why I and my colleaguesnhave called for a global pause,in any clinical applicationnof the CRISPR technology in human embryos,,to give us time,to really consider all of the variousnimplications of doing so.,And actually, there is an importantnprecedent for such a pause,from the 1970s,,when scientists got together,to call for a moratoriumnon the use of molecular cloning,,until the safety of that technologyncould be tested carefully and validated. 
 So, genome-engineered humansnare not with us yet,,but this is no longer science fiction.,Genome-engineered animals and plantsnare happening right now.,And this puts in front of all of usna huge responsibility,,to consider carefullynboth the unintended consequences,as well as the intended impactsnof a scientific breakthrough. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this isna technology with huge consequences,,as you pointed out.,Your attitude about asking for a pausenor a moratorium or a quarantine,is incredibly responsible.,There are, of course,nthe therapeutic results of this,,but then there are the un-therapeutic ones,and they seem to be the onesngaining traction,,particularly in the media.,This is one of the latest issuesnof The Economist -- "Editing humanity.",It's all about genetic enhancement,nit's not about therapeutics.,What kind of reactionsndid you get back in March,from your colleagues in the science world,,when you asked or suggested,that we should actually pause thisnfor a moment and think about it? 
 Jennifer Doudna: My colleaguesnwere actually, I think, delighted,to have the opportunitynto discuss this openly.,It's interesting that as I talk to people,,my scientific colleaguesnas well as others,,there's a wide varietynof viewpoints about this.,So clearly it's a topic that needsncareful consideration and discussion. 
 BG: There's a big meetingnhappening in December,that you and your colleagues are calling,,together with the National Academynof Sciences and others,,what do you hope will comenout of the meeting, practically? 
 JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views,of many different individualsnand stakeholders,who want to think about how to usenthis technology responsibly.,It may not be possible to come up withna consensus point of view,,but I think we should at least understand,what all the issues are as we go forward. 
 BG: Now, colleagues of yours,,like George Church,nfor example, at Harvard,,they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basicallynare just a question of safety.,We test and test and test again,nin animals and in labs,,and then once we feel it's safe enough,nwe move on to humans.",So that's kind of the othernschool of thought,,that we should actually usenthis opportunity and really go for it.,Is there a possible split happeningnin the science community about this?,I mean, are we going to seensome people holding back,because they have ethical concerns,,and some others just going forward,because some countries under-regulatenor don't regulate at all? 
 JD: Well, I think with any new technology,nespecially something like this,,there are going to bena variety of viewpoints,,and I think that'snperfectly understandable.,I think that in the end,,this technology will be usednfor human genome engineering,,but I think to do that without carefulnconsideration and discussion,of the risks and potential complications,would not be responsible. 
 BG: There are a lot of technologiesnand other fields of science,that are developing exponentially,npretty much like yours.,I'm thinking about artificialnintelligence, autonomous robots and so on.,No one seems --,aside from autonomous warfare robots --,nobody seems to have launchedna similar discussion in those fields,,in calling for a moratorium.,Do you think that your discussion maynserve as a blueprint for other fields? 
 JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientistsnto get out of the laboratory.,Speaking for myself,,it's a little bitnuncomfortable to do that.,But I do think that being involvednin the genesis of this,really puts me and my colleaguesnin a position of responsibility.,And I would say that I certainly hopenthat other technologies,will be considered in the same way,,just as we would want to considernsomething that could have implications,in other fields besides biology. 
 BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED. 
 JD: Thank you. 
 (Applause)A year ago, we were invitednby the Swiss Embassy in Berlin,to present our art projects.,We are used to invitations,nbut this invitation really thrilled us.,The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.,It is the only old buildingnin the government district,that was not destroyednduring the Second World War,,and it sits right nextnto the Federal Chancellery.,No one is closer to Chancellor Merkelnthan the Swiss diplomats. 
 (Laughter) 
 The government district in Berlinnalso contains the Reichstag --,Germany's parliament --nand the Brandenburg Gate,,and right next to the gatenthere are other embassies,,in particular the USnand the British Embassy. 
 Although Germany is an advanced democracy,,citizens are limitednin their constitutional rights,in its government district.,The right of assembly and the rightnto demonstrate are restricted there.,And this is interestingnfrom an artistic point of view.,The opportunities to exercisenparticipation and to express oneself,are always bound to a certain order,and always subjectnto a specific regulation.,With an awareness of the dependenciesnof these regulations,,we can gain a new perspective.,The given terms and conditionsnshape our perception, our actions,and our lives. 
 And this is crucial in another context.,Over the last couple of years,,we learned that from the roofsnof the US and the British Embassy,,the secret services have been listeningnto the entire district,,including the mobile phonenof Angela Merkel.,The antennas of the British GCHQ arenhidden in a white cylindrical radome,,while the listening postnof the American NSA,is covered by radio transparent screens. 
 But how to address these hiddennand disguised forces?,With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,,we accepted the invitationnof the Swiss Embassy.,And we used this opportunitynto exploit the specific situation. 
 If people are spying on us,nit stands to reason,that they have to listennto what we are saying. 
 (Laughter) 
 On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,nwe installed a series of antennas.,They weren't as sophisticated as thosenused by the Americans and the British. 
 (Laughter) 
 They were makeshift can antennas,,not camouflaged but totallynobvious and visible.,The Academy of Arts joined the project,,and so we built anothernlarge antenna on their rooftop,,exactly between the listening postsnof the NSA and the GCHQ. 
 (Laughter) 
 Never have we been observed in such detailnwhile building an art installation.,A helicopter circled over our heads,with a camera registeringneach and every move we made,,and on the roof of the US Embassy,nsecurity officers patrolled.,Although the government districtnis governed by a strict police order,,there are no specific lawsnrelating to digital communication.,Our installationnwas therefore perfectly legal,,and the Swiss Ambassadorninformed Chancellor Merkel about it.,We named the project "Can You Hear Me?" 
 (Laughter) 
 The antennas created an opennand free Wi-Fi communication network,in which anyone who wanted tonwould be able to participate,using any Wi-Fi-enabled devicenwithout any hindrance,,and be able to send messages,to those listening on the frequenciesnthat were being intercepted.,Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --,anything could be sent anonymously.,And people did communicate.,Over 15,000 messages were sent.,Here are some examples. 
 "Hello world, hello Berlin,nhello NSA, hello GCHQ." 
 "NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!nBlow the whistle!" 
 "This is the NSA. In God we trust.nAll others we track!!!!!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -nwe are part of your organizations.,# expect us. We will #shutdown" 
 "This is the NSA's Achilles heel.nOpen Networks." 
 "Agents, what twisted story of yourselfnwill you tell your grandchildren?" 
 "@NSA My neighbors are noisy.nPlease send a drone strike." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Make Love, Not cyberwar." 
 We invited the embassiesnand the government departments,to participate in the open network, too,,and to our surprise, they did.,Files appeared on the network,nincluding classified documents,leaked from the parliamentaryninvestigation commission,,which highlights that the free exchangenand discussion of vital information,is starting to become difficult,neven for members of a parliament.,We also organized guided toursnto experience and sound out,the power constellations on-site.,The tours visited the restricted zonesnaround the embassies,,and we discussed the potentialnand the highlights of communication. 
 If we become aware of the constellation,,the terms and conditions of communication,,it not only broadens our horizon,,it allows us to look behindnthe regulations that limit our worldview,,our specific social, politicalnor aesthetic conventions. 
 Let's look at an actual example.,The fate of people livingnin the makeshift settlements,on the outskirts of Paris,is hidden and faded from view.,It's a vicious circle.,It's not poverty, not racism,nnot exclusion that are new.,What is new is hownthese realities are hidden,and how people are made invisible,in an age of global and overwhelmingncommunication and exchange.,Such makeshift settlementsnare considered illegal,,and therefore those living in themndon't have a chance,of making their voices heard.,On the contrary, every time they appear,nevery time they risk becoming visible,,merely gives groundsnfor further persecution,,expulsion and suppression.,What interested us was how we couldncome to know this hidden side.,We were searching for an interfacenand we found one.,It's not a digital interface,nbut a physical one: it's a hotel. 
 We named the project "Hotel Gelem.",Together with Roma families,nwe created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,,for example, in Freiburg in Germany,nin Montreuil near Paris,,and also in the Balkans.,These are real hotels.,People can stay there.,But they aren't a commercial enterprise.,They are a symbol.,You can go online and asknfor a personal invitation,to come and live for a few daysnin the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,,eating, working and livingnwith the Roma families.,Here, the Roma familiesnare not the travelers;,the visitors are.,Here, the Roma familiesnare not a minority;,the visitors are. 
 The point is not to make judgments,,but rather to find outnabout the context that determines,these disparate and seeminglyninsurmountable contradictions.,In the world of globalization,,the continents are driftingncloser to each other.,Cultures, goods and peoplenare in permanent exchange,,but at the same time, the gapnbetween the world of the privileged,and the world of the excluded is growing. 
 We were recently in Australia.,For us, it was no problemnto enter the country.,We have European passports,nvisas and air tickets.,But asylum seekers who arrivenby boat in Australia,are deported or taken to prison.,The interception of the boats,and the disappearance of the peopleninto the detention system,are veiled by the Australian authorities.,These procedures are declarednto be secret military operations.,After dramatic escapesnfrom crisis zones and war zones,,men, women and childrennare detained by Australia without trial,,sometimes for years. 
 During our stay, however,,we managed to reach out and worknwith asylum seekers who were imprisoned,,despite strict screening and isolation.,From these contexts was bornnan installation in the art space,of the Queensland Universitynof Technology in Brisbane. 
 On the face of it,nit was a very simple installation.,On the floor, a stylized compassngave the direction,to each immigration detention center,,accompanied by the distancenand the name of the immigration facility.,But the exhibition stepncame in the form of connectivity.,Above every floor marking,nthere was a headset.,Visitors were offered the opportunitynto talk directly to a refugee,who was or had been imprisoned,in a specific detention facility,and engage in a personal conversation.,In the protected contextnof the art exhibition,,asylum seekers felt freento talk about themselves,,their story and their situation,nwithout fear of consequences.,Visitors immersed themselvesnin long conversations,about families torn apart,nabout dramatic escapes from war zones,,about suicide attempts,,about the fate of children in detention.,Emotions ran deep. Many wept.,Several revisited the exhibition.,It was a powerful experience. 
 Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.,The situation for the asylum seekersnis made worse by contradictory policies,and the temptationnof militarized responses.,We have also establishedncommunication systems,in remote refugee centersnin Switzerland and Greece.,They are all about providingnbasic information -- weather forecasts,,legal information, guidance.,But they are significant.,Information on the Internet,that could ensure survivalnalong dangerous routes,is being censored,,and the provision of such informationnis becoming increasingly criminalized. 
 This brings us back to our networknand to the antennas,on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin,and the "Can You Hear Me?" project.,We should not take it for grantednto be boundlessly connected.,We should start makingnour own connections,,fighting for this idea of an equalnand globally interconnected world.,This is essential to overcomenour speechlessness,and the separation provokednby rival political forces.,It is only in truly exposing ourselves,to the transformative powernof this experience,that we can overcomenprejudice and exclusion. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.,The other half of yournartistic duo is also here.,Christoph Wachter, come onstage. 
 (Applause) 
 First, tell me just a detail:,the name of the hotelnis not a random name.,Gelem means something specificnin the Roma language. 
 Mathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem"nis the title of the Romani hymn,,the official, and it meansn"I went a long way." 
 BG: That's just to addnthe detail to your talk.,But you two travelednto the island of Lesbos,very recently, you're just backna couple of days ago,,in Greece, where thousandsnof refugees are arriving,and have been arrivingnover the last few months.,What did you see therenand what did you do there? 
 Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is onenof the Greek islands close to Turkey,,and during our stay,,many asylum seekers arrived by boatnon overcrowded dinghies,,and after landing, they were leftncompletely on their own.,They are denied many services.,For example, they are not allowednto buy a bus ticket,or to rent a hotel room,,so many families literallynsleep in the streets.,And we installed networks therento allow basic communication,,because I think, I believe,,it's not only that we have to speaknabout the refugees,,I think we need to start talking to them.,And by doing so, we can realizenthat it is about human beings,,about their livesnand their struggle to survive. 
 BG: And allow them to talk as well.,Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.,Mathias, thank you for coming to TEDnand sharing your story. 
 (Applause)Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods. 
 Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise. 
 MW: Or ...,a paradise lost.,Bali:,island of garbage. 
 IW: In Bali,,we generate 680 cubic metersnof plastic garbage a day.,That's about a 14-story building.,And when it comes to plastic bags,,less than five percent gets recycled. 
 MW: We know that changes the imagenyou may have of our island.,It changed ours, too,nwhen we learned about it,,when we learned that almost allnplastic bags in Bali end up in our drains,and then in our rivers,and then in our ocean.,And those that don't evennmake it to the ocean,,they're either burned or littered. 
 IW: So we decidednto do something about it.,And we've been workingnfor almost three years now,to try to say no to plastic bagsnon our home island.,And we have hadnsome significant successes. 
 MW: We are sisters,,and we go to the best school on earth:,Green School, Bali.,Green School is not only differentnin the way that it is built out of bamboo,,but also in the way that it teaches.,We are taught to become leaders of today,,something a normal textbook cannot match. 
 IW: One day we had a lesson in class,where we learned about significant people,,like Nelson Mandela,,Lady Diana,and Mahatma Gandhi.,Walking home that day,,we agreed that we alsonwanted to be significant.,Why should we wait until we were grown up,to be significant?,We wanted to do something now. 
 MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,,we brainstormed and thoughtnof all the issues facing Bali.,And one thing that stood outnto us the most,was the plastic garbage.,But that is a huge problem.,So we looked into what wasna realistic target for us kids:,plastic bags.,And the idea was born. 
 IW: We started researching,,and let's just say, the more we learned,,there was nothing good about plastic bags.,And you know what?,We don't even need them. 
 MW: We were really inspirednby the efforts to say no to plastic bags,in many other places,,from Hawaii to Rwanda,and to severals citiesnlike Oakland and Dublin. 
 IW: And so the idea turned into the launchnof "Bye Bye Plastic Bags.",MW: In the yearsnthat we have been campaigning,,we have learned a lot. 
 Lesson number one:,you cannot do it all by yourself.,You need a big team of like-minded kids,,and so we formednthe Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.,The volunteer team includesnchildren from all over the island,,from both international and local schools.,And together with them,,we started a multi-layered approach,,based on an on- and off-linensignature petition,,educational and inspirationalnpresentations at schools,and we raise general awarenessnat markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.,And last but not least,,we distribute alternative bags,,bags like net bags,,recycled newspaper bags,or 100 percent organic material bags,,all made by localninitiatives on the island. 
 IW: We run a pilot village,,home of 800 families.,The village mayor was our first friend,and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.,We focused on making the customers aware,,because that's where the changenneeds to happen.,The village is alreadyntwo-thirds along the way,of becoming plastic bag free. 
 Our first attempts to get the governmentnof Bali on board failed.,So we thought,,"Hmm ... a petitionnwith one million signatures.,They can't ignore us, right?" 
 MW: Right! 
 IW: But, who would have guessed,one million signatures is, like,na thousand times a thousand? 
 (Laughter) 
 We got stuck --,till we learned lesson number two:,think outside the box.,Someone mentioned,that the Bali airport handlesn16 million arrivals and departures a year. 
 MW: But how do we get into the airport?,And here comes lesson number three:,persistence.,Off we headed to the airport.,We got past the janitor.,And then it was his boss's boss,,and then the assistant office manager,,and then the office manager,,and then ...,we got shuffled downntwo levels and thought,,well, here comes the janitor again. 
 And after several days knocking on doors,and just being kids on a mission,,we finally got to the commercialnmanager of Bali airports.,And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags"nspeech, and being a very nice man,,he said, [imitating the man's voice]n"I cannot believe what I'm about say,,but I'm going to give authorization,to collect signaturesnbehind customs and immigrations." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 IW: In our first hour and a half there,,we got almost 1,000 signatures.,How cool is that? 
 Lesson number four:,you need championsnat all levels of society,,from students to commercialnmanagers to famous people.,And thanks to the attractionnof Green School,,we had access to a steadynstream of celebrities.,Ban Ki Moon taught us,that Secretary-Generalsnof the United Nations,don't sign petitions -- 
 (Laughter) 
 even if kids ask nicely.,But he promised to spread the word,,and now we work closelynwith the United Nations. 
 MW: Jane Goodall taught usnthe power of a people's network.,She started with just onenRoots & Shoots group,and now she has 4,000 groupsnaround the world.,We are one of them.,She's a real inspiration. 
 If you're a fellow Rotarian,,nice to meet you.,We're Interactors,,the youngest departmentnof Rotary International. 
 IW: But we have also learnednmuch about patience, 
 MW: how to deal with frustrations, 
 IW: leadership, 
 MW: teamwork, 
 IW: friendship, 
 MW: we learned morenabout the Balinese and their culture 
 IW: and we learnednabout the importance of commitment. 
 MW: It's not always easy.,Sometimes it does getna little bit hard to walk your talk. 
 IW: But last year, we did exactly that.,We went to India to give a talk,,and our parents took us to visit,the former private housenof Mahatma Gandhi.,We learned about the powernof hunger strikes,he did to reach his goals.,Yes, by the end of the tour,,when we met our parents again,,we both made a decision and said,,"We're going on a hunger strike!" 
 (Laughter) 
 MW: And you can probablynimagine their faces.,It took a lot of convincing,,and not only to our parents,but to our friendsnand to our teachers as well.,Isabel and I were seriousnabout doing this.,So we met with a nutritionist,,and we came up with a compromise,of not eating from sunrisento sunset every day,until the governor of Balinwould agree to meet with us,to talk about how to stopnplastic bags on Bali. 
 IW: Our "mogak makan,"nas it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,,started.,We used social media to support our goal,and already on day two,,police started to comento our home and school.,What were these two girls doing?,We knew we weren't makingnthe governor look his best,by doing this food strike --,we could have gone to jail.,But, hey, it worked.,Twenty-four hours later,,we were picked up from school,and escorted to the officenof the governor. 
 MW: And there he was -- 
 (Applause) 
 waiting for us to meet and speak,,being all supportivenand thankful for our willingness,to care for the beautynand the environment of Bali. 
 He signed a promise,to help the people of Balinsay no to plastic bags.,And we are now friends,,and on a regular basis,,we remind him and his teamnof the promises he has made.,And indeed,,recently he stated and committed,that Bali will benplastic bag free by 2018. 
 (Applause) 
 IW: Also, at the International Airportnof Bali, one of our supporters,is planning to startna plastic bag-free policy by 2016. 
 MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags,and bring in your own reusable bag,is our next message to changenthat mindset of the public. 
 IW: Our short-term campaign,,"One Island / One Voice,",is all about this.,We check and recognizenthe shops and restaurants,that have declared themselvesna plastic bag-free zone,,and we put this sticker at their entrance,and publish their names on social media,and some important magazines on Bali.,And conversely,,that highlights thosenwho do not have the sticker. 
 (Laughter) 
 MW: So, why are we actuallyntelling you all of this?,Well, partly, it is because we are proud,of the results that,ntogether with our team,,we have been able to reach.,But also because along the way,,we have learned that kids can do things.,We can make things happen.,Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old,when we started this.,We never had a business plan,,nor a fixed strategy,,nor any hidden agendas --,just the idea in front of us,and a group of friends working with us.,All we wanted to donwas stop those plastic bags,from wrapping and suffocatingnour beautiful home.,Kids have a boundless energy,and a motivation to be the changenthe world needs. 
 IW: So to all the kids of this beautifulnbut challenging world:,go for it!,Make that difference.,We're not telling younit's going to be easy.,We're telling younit's going to be worth it.,Us kids may only be 25 percentnof the world's population,,but we are 100 percent of the future. 
 MW: We still have a lot of work to do,,but know that we still not stop,until the first question askednwhen arriving at the Bali airports will be 
 Both: "Welcome to Bali,,do you have nay plastic bags to declare?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Om shanti shanti shanti om. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Do you think the world is goingnto be a better place next year?,In the next decade?,Can we end hunger,,achieve gender equality,,halt climate change,,all in the next 15 years? 
 Well, according to the governmentsnof the world, yes we can.,In the last few days,nthe leaders of the world,,meeting at the UN in New York,,agreed a new set of Global Goals,for the development of the world to 2030.,And here they are:,these goals are the productnof a massive consultation exercise.,The Global Goals are who we,nhumanity, want to be. 
 Now that's the plan, but can we get there?,Can this vision for a better worldnreally be achieved?,Well, I'm here today becausenwe've run the numbers,,and the answer, shockingly,,is that maybe we actually can.,But not with business as usual. 
 Now, the idea that the worldnis going to get a better place,may seem a little fanciful.,Watch the news every day and the worldnseems to be going backwards, not forwards.,And let's be frank:,it's pretty easy to be skepticalnabout grand announcements,coming out of the UN. 
 But please, I invite you to suspendnyour disbelief for just a moment.,Because back in 2001,,the UN agreed another set of goals,nthe Millennium Development Goals.,And the flagship target therenwas to halve the proportion of people,living in poverty by 2015.,The target was to takenfrom a baseline of 1990,,when 36 percent of the world'snpopulation lived in poverty,,to get to 18 percent poverty this year. 
 Did we hit this target?,Well, no, we didn't.,We exceeded it.,This year, global povertynis going to fall to 12 percent.,Now, that's still not good enough,,and the world does still havenplenty of problems.,But the pessimists and doomsayersnwho say that the world can't get better,are simply wrong. 
 So how did we achieve this success?,Well, a lot of it was becausenof economic growth.,Some of the biggest reductions in povertynwere in countries such as China and India,,which have seen rapidneconomic growth in recent years.,So can we pull off the same trick again?,Can economic growthnget us to the Global Goals?,Well, to answer that question,,we need to benchmark where the worldnis today against the Global Goals,and figure out how far we have to travel. 
 But that ain't easy,,because the Global Goalsnaren't just ambitious,,they're also pretty complicated.,Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets,and literally hundreds of indicators.,Also, while some of the goalsnare pretty specific --,end hunger --,others are a lot vaguer --,promote peaceful and tolerant societies. 
 So to help us with this benchmarking,,I'm going to use a toolncalled the Social Progress Index.,What this does is measures all the stuffnthe Global Goals are trying to achieve,,but sums it up into a single numbernthat we can use as our benchmark,and track progress over time. 
 The Social Progress Index basically asksnthree fundamental questions,about a society.,First of all, does everyone haventhe basic needs of survival:,food, water, shelter, safety?,Secondly, does everyone haventhe building blocks of a better life:,education, information, healthnand a sustainable environment?,And does everyone haventhe opportunity to improve their lives,,through rights, freedom of choice,nfreedom from discrimination,,and access to the world'snmost advanced knowledge? 
 The Social Progress Index sums all thisntogether using 52 indicators,to create an aggregate scorenon a scale of 0 to 100.,And what we find is that there'sna wide diversity of performance,in the world today.,The highest performing country,nNorway, scores 88.,The lowest performing country,nCentral African Republic, scores 31.,And we can add upnall the countries together,,weighting for the differentnpopulation sizes,,and that global score is 61.,In concrete terms,,that means that the average human beingnis living on a level of social progress,about the same of Cubanor Kazakhstan today. 
 That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.,What do we have to get tonto achieve the Global Goals? 
 Now, the Global Goalsnare certainly ambitious,,but they're not about turning the worldninto Norway in just 15 years.,So having looked at the numbers,nmy estimate is that a score of 75,would not only be a giant leap forwardnin human well-being,,it would also count as hittingnthe Global Goals target.,So there's our target, 75 out of 100.,Can we get there? 
 Well, the Social Progress Indexncan help us calculate this,,because as you might have noticed,,there are no economic indicators in there;,there's no GDP or economic growthnin the Social Progress Index model.,And what that lets us donis understand the relationship,between economic growthnand social progress. 
 Let me show you on this chart.,So here on the vertical axis,nI've put social progress,,the stuff the Global Goalsnare trying to achieve.,Higher is better.,And then on the horizontal axis,nis GDP per capita.,Further to the right means richer.,And in there, I'm now going to putnall the countries of the world,,each one represented by a dot,,and on top of that I'm going to putnthe regression line,that shows the average relationship.,And what this tells usnis that as we get richer,,social progress does tend to improve.,However, as we get richer,neach extra dollar of GDP,is buying us less and lessnsocial progress.,And now we can use this informationnto start building our forecast.,So here is the world in 2015.,We have a social progress score of 61,and a GDP per capita of $14,000.,And the place we're trying to get to,nremember, is 75, that Global Goals target.,So here we are today,n$14,000 per capita GDP.,How rich are we going to be in 2030?,That's what we need to know next.,Well, the best forecast we can find comesnfrom the US Department of Agriculture,,which forecasts 3.1 percentnaverage global economic growth,over the next 15 years,,which means that in 2030,nif they're right,,per capita GDP will be about $23,000.,So now the question is:nif we get that much richer,,how much social progressnare we going to get?,Well, we asked a teamnof economists at Deloitte,who checked and crunched the numbers,,and they came back and said, well, look:nif the world's average wealth goes,from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,,social progress is going to increase,from 61 to 62.4. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase. 
 Now this seems a bit strange.,Economic growth seemsnto have really helped,in the fight against poverty,,but it doesn't seemnto be having much impact,on trying to get to the Global Goals.,So what's going on?,Well, I think there are two things.,The first is that in a way,nwe're the victims of our own success.,We've used up the easy winsnfrom economic growth,,and now we're moving onnto harder problems.,And also, we know that economic growthncomes with costs as well as benefits.,There are costs to the environment, costsnfrom new health problems like obesity. 
 So that's the bad news.,We're not going to get to the Global Goalsnjust by getting richer. 
 So are the pessimists right? 
 Well, maybe not.,Because the Social Progress Indexnalso has some very good news.,Let me take you backnto that regression line.,So this is the average relationshipnbetween GDP and social progress,,and this is what ournlast forecast was based on.,But as you saw already,,there is actually lots of noisenaround this trend line. 
 What that tells us, quite simply,,is that GDP is not destiny.,We have countries that are underperforming,on social progress,nrelative to their wealth.,Russia has lotsnof natural resource wealth,,but lots of social problems.,China has boomed economically,,but hasn't made much headwaynon human rights or environmental issues.,India has a space programnand millions of people without toilets.,Now, on the other hand, we have countriesnthat are overperforming,on social progress relative to their GDP.,Costa Rica has prioritized education,nhealth and environmental sustainability,,and as a result, it's achievingna very high level of social progress,,despite only having a rather modest GDP.,And Costa Rica's not alone.,From poor countries like Rwandanto richer countries like New Zealand,,we see that it's possible to getnlots of social progress,,even if your GDP is not so great. 
 And that's really important,nbecause it tells us two things.,First of all, it tells us that we alreadynin the world have the solutions,to many of the problemsnthat the Global Goals are trying to solve.,It also tells usnthat we're not slaves to GDP.,Our choices matter: if we prioritizenthe well-being of people,,then we can make a lot more progressnthan our GDP might expect. 
 How much? Enough to get usnto the Global Goals?,Well, let's look at some numbers.,What we know already: the world todaynis scoring 61 on social progress,,and the place we want to get to is 75.,If we rely on economic growth alone,,we're going to get to 62.4.,So let's assume now that we can getnthe countries that are currently,underperforming on social progress --nthe Russia, China, Indias --,just up to the average.,How much social progress does that get us?,Well, that takes us to 65.,It's a bit better, but stillnquite a long way to go.,So let's get a little bit morenoptimistic and say,,what if every countryngets a little bit better,at turning its wealth into well-being?,Well then, we get to 67.,And now let's be even bolder still.,What if every country in the worldnchose to be like Costa Rica,in prioritizing human well-being,,using its wealth for the well-beingnof its citizens?,Well then, we get to nearly 73,nvery close to the Global Goals. 
 Can we achieve the Global Goals?,Certainly not with business as usual.,Even a flood tide of economic growthnis not going to get us there,,if it just raises the mega-yachtsnand the super-wealthy,and leaves the rest behind.,If we're going to achieve the Global Goalsnwe have to do things differently.,We have to prioritize social progress,nand really scale solutions,around the world.,I believe the Global Goalsnare a historic opportunity,,because the world's leadersnhave promised to deliver them.,Let's not dismiss the goalsnor slide into pessimism;,let's hold them to that promise.,And we need to hold them to that promisenby holding them accountable,,tracking their progress all the waynthrough the next 15 years. 
 And I want to finish by showing you,a way to do that, callednthe People's Report Card.,The People's Report Card brings togethernall this data into a simple framework,that we'll all be familiarnwith from our school days,,to hold them to account.,It grades our performancenon the Global Goals,on a scale from F to A,,where F is humanity at its worst,nand A is humanity at its best.,Our world today is scoring a C-.,The Global Goals are all aboutngetting to an A,,and that's why we're going to be updatingnthe People's Report Card annually,,for the world and for allnthe countries of the world,,so we can hold our leaders to account,to achieve this targetnand fulfill this promise.,Because getting to the Global Goals willnonly happen if we do things differently,,if our leaders do things differently,,and for that to happen,nthat needs us to demand it. 
 So let's reject business as usual.,Let's demand a different path.,Let's choose the world that we want. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.,Michael, just one question:nthe Millennium Development Goals,established 15 years ago,,they were kind of applyingnto every country,but it turned out to be reallyna scorecard for emerging countries.,Now the new Global Goalsnare explicitly universal.,They ask for every country to show actionnand to show progress.,How can I, as a private citizen,nuse the report card,to create pressure for action? 
 Michael Green: This is a really importantnpoint; it's a big shift in priorities --,it's no longer about poorncountries and just poverty.,It's about every country.,And every country is going to havenchallenges in getting to the Global Goals.,Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,nSwitzerland has got to work to do.,And so that's why we're going to producenthese report cards in 2016,for every country in the world.,Then we can really see, how are we doing?,And it's not going to be rich countriesnscoring straight A's.,And that, then, I think,nis to provide a point of focus,for people to start demanding actionnand start demanding progress. 
 BG: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)For much of the past century,,architecture was under the spellnof a famous doctrine.,"Form follows function" had becomenmodernity's ambitious manifesto,and detrimental straitjacket,,as it liberated architecturenfrom the decorative,,but condemned it to utilitarian rigornand restrained purpose.,Of course, architecture is about function,,but I want to remember a rewritingnof this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,,and I want to proposena completely different quality.,If form follows fiction,,we could think of architecturenand buildings as a space of stories --,stories of the people that live there,,of the people that worknin these buildings.,And we could start to imaginenthe experiences our buildings create. 
 In this sense, I'm interested in fiction,not as the implausible but as the real,,as the reality of what architecture means,for the people that livenin it and with it.,Our buildings are prototypes,nideas for how the space of living,or how the space of workingncould be different,,and what a space of culturenor a space of media could look like today.,Our buildings are real;nthey're being built.,They're an explicit engagementnin physical reality,and conceptual possibility.,I think of our architecturenas organizational structures.,At their core is indeednstructural thinking, like a system:,How can we arrange thingsnin both a functional,and experiential way?,How can we create structuresnthat generate a series,of relationships and narratives?,And how can fictive stories,of the inhabitants and usersnof our buildings,script the architecture,,while the architecture scriptsnthose stories at the same time? 
 And here comes the second term into play,,what I call "narrative hybrids" --,structures of multiplensimultaneous stories,that unfold throughoutnthe buildings we create.,So we could think of architecturenas complex systems of relationships,,both in a programmatic and functional way,and in an experientialnand emotive or social way. 
 This is the headquartersnfor China's national broadcaster,,which I designed togethernwith Rem Koolhaas at OMA.,When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002,nthe city planners showed us this image:,a forest of several hundred skyscrapers,to emerge in the centralnbusiness district,,except at that time,nonly a handful of them existed.,So we had to design in a contextnthat we knew almost nothing about,,except one thing:nit would all be about verticality. 
 Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --nit's a profoundly hierarchical structure,,the top always the best,nthe bottom the worst,,and the taller you are,nthe better, so it seems.,And we wanted to ask ourselves,,could a building be aboutna completely different quality?,Could it undo this hierarchy,nand could it be about a system,that is more about collaboration,nrather than isolation?,So we took this needlenand bent it back into itself,,into a loop of interconnected activities.,Our idea was to bring all aspectsnof television-making,into one single structure: news,nprogram production, broadcasting,,research and training, administration --,all into a circuitnof interconnected activities,where people would meet in a processnof exchange and collaboration. 
 I still very much like this image.,It reminds one of biology classes,nif you remember the human body,with all its organsnand circulatory systems, like at school.,And suddenly you think of architecturenno longer as built substance,,but as an organism, as a life form.,And as you start to dissect this organism,,you can identify a seriesnof primary technical clusters --,program production,nbroadcasting center and news.,Those are tightly intertwinednwith social clusters:,meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --,informal spaces for peoplento meet and exchange.,So the organizational structurenof this building was a hybrid,between the technical and the social,,the human and the performative.,And of course, we used the loopnof the building as a circulatory system,,to thread everything togethernand to allow both visitors and staff,to experience all these differentnfunctions in a great unity. 
 With 473,000 square meters,,it is one of the largest buildingsnever built in the world.,It has a population of over 10,000 people,,and of course, this is a scalenthat exceeds the comprehension,of many things and the scalenof typical architecture.,So we stopped work for a while,and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticksnand glued them onto a model,,just simply to confront ourselvesnwith what that quantity actually meant. 
 But of course, it's not a number,,it is the people, it is a communitynthat inhabits the building,,and in order to both comprehendnthis, but also script this architecture,,we identified five characters,nhypothetical characters,,and we followed them throughout their daynin a life in this building,,thought of where they would meet,nwhat they would experience.,So it was a way to script and designnthe building, but of course,,also to communicate its experiences.,This was part of an exhibitionnwith the Museum of Modern Art,in both New York and Beijing. 
 This is the main broadcast control room,,a technical installation so large,,it can broadcast over 200nchannels simultaneously.,And this is how the buildingnstands in Beijing today.,Its first broadcast livenwas the London Olympics 2012,,after it had been completednfrom the outside for the Beijing Olympics.,And you can see at the very tipnof this 75-meter cantilever,,those three little circles.,And they're indeed part of a public loopnthat goes through the building.,They're a piece of glassnthat you can stand on,and watch the city pass bynbelow you in slow motion. 
 The building has becomenpart of everyday life in Beijing.,It is there.,It has also become a very popular backdrop,for wedding photography. 
 (Laughter) 
 But its most important momentnis maybe sill this one.,"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,",a magazine that broadcasts whatnis happening in town during the week,,and suddenly you see the buildingnportrayed no longer as physical matter,,but actually as an urban actor,,as part of a series of personasnthat define the life of the city.,So architecture suddenlynassumes the quality of a player,,of something that writes storiesnand performs stories.,And I think that could be onenof its primary meanings,that we believe in. 
 But of course, there's anothernstory to this building.,It is the story of the peoplenthat made it --,400 engineers and architectsnthat I was guiding,over almost a decade of collaborative work,that we spent togethernin scripting this building,,in imagining its reality,and ultimately getting it built in China. 
 This is a residential developmentnin Singapore, large scale.,If we look at Singapore like most of Asianand more and more of the world,,of course, it is dominated by the tower,,a typology that indeed createsnmore isolation than connectedness,,and I wanted to ask, howncould we think about living,,not only in terms of the privacynand individuality of ourselves,and our apartment,,but in an idea of a collective?,How could we think about creatingna communal environment,in which sharing things was as greatnas having your own? 
 The typical answer to the question --nwe had to design 1,040 apartments --,would have looked like this:,24-story height limit givennby the planning authorities,,12 towers with nothingnbut residual in between --,a very tight system that,nalthough the tower isolates you,,it doesn't even give you privacy,nbecause you're so close to the next one,,that it is very questionablenwhat the qualities of this would be. 
 So I proposed to topple the towers,nthrow the vertical into the horizontal,and stack them up,,and what looks a bit random from the side,,if you look from the viewpointnof the helicopter,,you can see its organizational structurenis actually a hexagonal grid,,in which these horizontalnbuilding blocks are stacked up,to create huge outdoor courtyards --ncentral spaces for the community,,programmed with a varietynof amenities and functions.,And you see that these courtyardsnare not hermetically sealed spaces.,They're open, permeable;nthey're interconnected.,We called the project "The Interlace,",thinking that we interlacenand interconnect,the human beings and the spaces alike.,And the detailed qualitynof everything we designed,was about animating the spacenand giving the space to the inhabitants.,And, in fact, it was a system,where we would layernprimarily communal spaces,,stacked to more and morenindividual and private spaces.,So we would open up a spectrum,between the collective and the individual. 
 A little piece of math:,if we count all the greennthat we left on the ground,,minus the footprint of the buildings,,and we would add backnthe green of all the terraces,,we have 112 percent green space,,so more nature than notnhaving built a building.,And of course this little piece of mathnshows you that we are multiplying,the space availablento those who live there.,This is, in fact, the 13th floornof one of these terraces.,So you see new datum planes,nnew grounds planes for social activity. 
 We paid a lot of attentionnto sustainability.,In the tropics, the sun is the mostnimportant thing to pay attention to,,and, in fact, it is seekingnprotection from the sun.,We first proved that all apartmentsnwould have sufficient daylight,through the year.,We then went on to optimizenthe glazing of the facades,to minimize the energynconsumption of the building.,But most importantly, we could proventhat through the geometry,of the building design,,the building itself would providensufficient shading to the courtyards,so that those would be usablenthroughout the entire year.,We further placed water bodiesnalong the prevailing wind corridors,,so that evaporative coolingnwould create microclimates,that, again, would enhancenthe quality of those spaces,available for the inhabitants.,And it was the idea of creatingnthis variety of choices,,of freedom to thinknwhere you would want to be,,where you would want to escape, maybe,,within the own complexitynof the complex in which you live. 
 But coming from Asia to Europe:,a building for a Germannmedia company based in Berlin,,transitioning from the traditionalnprint media to the digital media.,And its CEO asked a fewnvery pertinent questions:,Why would anyone todaynstill want to go to the office,,because you can actually work anywhere?,And how could a digital identitynof a company be embodied,in a building?,We created not only an object,nbut at the center of this object,we created a giant space,,and this space was aboutnthe experience of a collective,,the experience of collaborationnand of togetherness.,Communication, interactionnas the center of a space,that in itself would float,,like what we call the collaborative cloud,,in the middle of the building,,surrounded by an envelopenof standard modular offices.,So with only a few stepsnfrom your quiet work desk,,you could participatenin the giant collective experience,of the central space. 
 Finally, we come to London,na project commissioned,by the London LegacynDevelopment Corporation,of the Mayor of London.,We were asked to undertake a study,and investigate the potential of a site,out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.,In the 19th century, Prince Albertnhad created Albertopolis.,And Boris Johnson thoughtnof creating Olympicopolis. 
 The idea was to bring togethernsome of Britain's greatest institutions,,some international ones,nand to create a new system of synergies.,Prince Albert, as yet, creatednAlbertopolis in the 19th century,,thought of showcasingnall achievements of mankind,,bringing arts and science closer together.,And he built Exhibition Road,na linear sequence of those institutions. 
 But of course, today's societynhas moved on from there.,We no longer live in a world,in which everythingnis as clearly delineated,or separated from each other.,We live in a world in whichnboundaries start to blur,between the different domains,,and in which collaboration and interactionnbecomes far more important,than keeping separations.,So we wanted to thinknof a giant culture machine,,a building that would orchestratenand animate the various domains,,but allow them to interactnand collaborate.,At the base of it is a very simple module,,a ring module.,It can function as a double-loadedncorridor, has daylight, has ventilation.,It can be glazed over,and turned into a giantnexhibitional performance space.,These modules were stacked together,with the idea that almost anynfunction could, over time,,occupy any of these modules.,So institutions could shrink or contract,,as, of course, the future of culturenis, in a way, the most uncertain of all.,This is how the building sits,nadjacent to the Aquatics Centre,,opposite the Olympic Stadium.,And you can see hownits cantilevering volumes,project out and engage the public space,and how its courtyardsnanimate the public inside. 
 The idea was to create a complex system,in which institutional entitiesncould maintain their own identity,,in which they would notnbe subsumed in a singular volume.,Here's a scale comparisonnto the Centre Pompidou in Paris.,It both shows the enormous scalenand potential of the project,,but also the difference:,here, it is a multiplicitynof a heterogeneous structure,,in which different entities can interact,without losing their own identity.,And it was this thought: to createnan organizational structure,that would allow for multiplennarratives to be scripted --,for those in the educational partsnthat create and think culture;,for those that presentnthe visual arts, the dance;,and for the public to benadmitted into all of this,with a series of possible trajectories,,to script their own readingnof these narratives,and their own experience. 
 And I want to end on a projectnthat is very small,,in a way, very different:,a floating cinemanin the ocean of Thailand.,Friends of mine had foundedna film festival,,and I thought,,if we think of the storiesnand narratives of movies,,we should also think of the narrativesnof the people that watch them.,So I designed a smallnmodular floating platform,,based on the techniquesnof local fishermen,,how they built their lobsternand fish farms.,We collaborated with the local community,and built, out of recyclednmaterials of their own,,this fantastical floating platform,that gently moved in the ocean,as we watched filmsnfrom the British film archive,,[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.,The most primordialnexperiences of the audience,merged with the stories of the movies. 
 So I believe that architecture exceedsnthe domain of physical matter,,of the built environment,,but is really about hownwe want to live our lives,,how we script our own storiesnand those of others. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Late in January 1975,,a 17-year-old German girlncalled Vera Brandes,walked out onto the stagenof the Cologne Opera House.,The auditorium was empty.,It was lit only by the dim, green glownof the emergency exit sign.,This was the mostnexciting day of Vera's life.,She was the youngestnconcert promoter in Germany,,and she had persuadednthe Cologne Opera House,to host a late-night concert of jazz,from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.,1,400 people were coming.,And in just a few hours,,Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,,he'd sit down at the piano,and without rehearsal or sheet music,,he would begin to play. 
 But right now,,Vera was introducing Keithnto the piano in question,,and it wasn't going well.,Jarrett looked to the instrumentna little warily,,played a few notes,,walked around it,,played a few more notes,,muttered something to his producer.,Then the producerncame over to Vera and said ...,"If you don't get a new piano,nKeith can't play." 
 There'd been a mistake.,The opera house had providednthe wrong instrument.,This one had this harsh,ntinny upper register,,because all the felt had worn away.,The black notes were sticking,,the white notes were out of tune,,the pedals didn't work,and the piano itself was just too small.,It wouldn't create the volume,that would fill a large spacensuch as the Cologne Opera House. 
 So Keith Jarrett left.,He went and sat outside in his car,,leaving Vera Brandes,to get on the phonento try to find a replacement piano.,Now she got a piano tuner,,but she couldn't get a new piano.,And so she went outside,and she stood there in the rain,,talking to Keith Jarrett,,begging him not to cancel the concert.,And he looked out of his car,at this bedraggled,nrain-drenched German teenager,,took pity on her,,and said,,"Never forget ... only for you." 
 And so a few hours later,,Jarrett did indeed step outnonto the stage of the opera house,,he sat down at the unplayable piano,and began. 
 (Music) 
 Within moments it became clearnthat something magical was happening.,Jarrett was avoidingnthose upper registers,,he was sticking to the middlentones of the keyboard,,which gave the piecena soothing, ambient quality.,But also, because the piano was so quiet,,he had to set up these rumbling,nrepetitive riffs in the bass.,And he stood up twisting,npounding down on the keys,,desperately trying to create enough volumento reach the people in the back row. 
 It's an electrifying performance.,It somehow has this peaceful quality,,and at the same time it's full of energy,,it's dynamic.,And the audience loved it.,Audiences continue to love it,because the recording of the Köln Concert,is the best-selling piano album in history,and the best-sellingnsolo jazz album in history. 
 Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.,He had embraced that mess, and it soared.,But let's think for a momentnabout Jarrett's initial instinct.,He didn't want to play.,Of course,,I think any of us,nin any remotely similar situation,,would feel the same way,nwe'd have the same instinct.,We don't want to be askednto do good work with bad tools.,We don't want to have to overcomenunnecessary hurdles.,But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,,and thank goodness he changed his mind.,And I think our instinct is also wrong.,I think we need to gainna bit more appreciation,for the unexpected advantagesnof having to cope with a little mess.,So let me give you some examples,from cognitive psychology,,from complexity science,,from social psychology,,and of course, rock 'n' roll. 
 So cognitive psychology first.,We've actually known for a while,that certain kinds of difficulty,,certain kinds of obstacle,,can actually improve our performance.,For example,,the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,,a few years ago,,teamed up with high school teachers.,And he asked them to reformat the handouts,that they were givingnto some of their classes.,So the regular handout would be formattednin something straightforward,,such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.,But half these classes were gettingnhandouts that were formatted,in something sort of intense,nlike Haettenschweiler,,or something with a zesty bounce,nlike Comic Sans italicized.,Now, these are really ugly fonts,,and they're difficult fonts to read.,But at the end of the semester,,students were given exams,,and the students who'd been askednto read the more difficult fonts,,had actually done better on their exams,,in a variety of subjects.,And the reason is,,the difficult font had slowed them down,,forced them to work a bit harder,,to think a bit morenabout what they were reading,,to interpret it ...,and so they learned more. 
 Another example.,The psychologist Shelley Carsonnhas been testing Harvard undergraduates,for the qualitynof their attentional filters.,What do I mean by that?,What I mean is,nimagine you're in a restaurant,,you're having a conversation,,there are all kinds of other conversationsngoing on in the restaurant,,you want to filter them out,,you want to focusnon what's important to you.,Can you do that?,If you can, you havengood, strong attentional filters.,But some people really struggle with that.,Some of Carson's undergraduatensubjects struggled with that.,They had weak filters,nthey had porous filters --,let a lot of external information in.,And so what that meant is they werenconstantly being interrupted,by the sights and the soundsnof the world around them.,If there was a television onnwhile they were doing their essays,,they couldn't screen it out. 
 Now, you would thinknthat that was a disadvantage ...,but no.,When Carson looked at whatnthese students had achieved,,the ones with the weak filters,were vastly more likely,to have some realncreative milestone in their lives,,to have published their first novel,,to have released their first album.,These distractions were actuallyngrists to their creative mill.,They were able to think outside the boxnbecause their box was full of holes. 
 Let's talk about complexity science.,So how do you solve a really complex --,the world's fullnof complicated problems --,how do you solvena really complicated problem? 
 For example, you try to make a jet engine.,There are lots and lotsnof different variables,,the operating temperature, the materials,,all the different dimensions, the shape.,You can't solve that kindnof problem all in one go,,it's too hard.,So what do you do?,Well, one thing you can donis try to solve it step-by-step.,So you have some kind of prototype,and you tweak it,nyou test it, you improve it.,You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.,Now, this idea of marginal gainsnwill eventually get you a good jet engine.,And it's been quite widelynimplemented in the world.,So you'll hear about it, for example,nin high performance cycling,,web designers will talk about tryingnto optimize their web pages,,they're lookingnfor these step-by-step gains. 
 That's a good waynto solve a complicated problem.,But you know what wouldnmake it a better way?,A dash of mess.,You add randomness,,early on in the process,,you make crazy moves,,you try stupid things that shouldn't work,,and that will tend to makenthe problem-solving work better.,And the reason for that is,the trouble with the step-by-step process,,the marginal gains,,is they can walk youngradually down a dead end.,And if you start with the randomness,nthat becomes less likely,,and your problem-solvingnbecomes more robust. 
 Let's talk about social psychology.,So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,nwith some colleagues,,recently gave murder mysterynproblems to some students,,and these studentsnwere collected in groups of four,and they were given dossiersnwith information about a crime --,alibis and evidence,nwitness statements and three suspects.,And the groups of four studentsnwere asked to figure out who did it,,who committed the crime.,And there were two treatmentsnin this experiment.,In some cases these were four friends,,they all knew each other well.,In other cases,,three friends and a stranger.,And you can see where I'm going with this. 
 Obviously I'm going to say,that the groups with the strangernsolved the problem more effectively,,which is true, they did.,Actually, they solved the problemnquite a lot more effectively.,So the groups of four friends,,they only had a 50-50 chancenof getting the answer right.,Which is actually not that great --,in multiple choice, for three answers?n50-50's not good. 
 (Laughter) 
 The three friends and the stranger,,even though the strangerndidn't have any extra information,,even though it was just a case,of how that changed the conversationnto accommodate that awkwardness,,the three friends and the stranger,,they had a 75 percent chancenof finding the right answer.,That's quite a big leap in performance. 
 But I think what's really interesting,is not just that the three friendsnand the stranger did a better job,,but how they felt about it.,So when Katherine Phillipsninterviewed the groups of four friends,,they had a nice time,,they also thought they'd done a good job.,They were complacent.,When she spoke to the threenfriends and the stranger,,they had not had a nice time --,it's actually rather difficult,nit's rather awkward ...,and they were full of doubt.,They didn't think they'd done a good jobneven though they had.,And I think that really exemplifies,the challenge that we'rendealing with here. 
 Because, yeah --,the ugly font,,the awkward stranger,,the random move ...,these disruptions help us solve problems,,they help us become more creative.,But we don't feel that they're helping us.,We feel that they'rengetting in the way ...,and so we resist.,And that's why the last examplenis really important. 
 So I want to talk about somebody,from the backgroundnof the world of rock 'n' roll.,And you may know him,nhe's actually a TED-ster.,His name is Brian Eno.,He is an ambient composer --nrather brilliant. 
 He's also a kind of catalyst,behind some of the greatnrock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.,He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,",he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby"nand "The Joshua Tree,",he's worked with DEVO,,he's worked with Coldplay,nhe's worked with everybody. 
 And what does he do to makenthese great rock bands better?,Well, he makes a mess.,He disrupts their creative processes.,It's his role to be the awkward stranger.,It's his role to tell them,that they have to playnthe unplayable piano. 
 And one of the waysnin which he creates this disruption,is through this remarkablendeck of cards --,I have my signed copy here --nthank you, Brian.,They're called The Oblique Strategies,,he developed them with a friend of his.,And when they're stuck in the studio,,Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.,He'll draw one at random,,and he'll make the bandnfollow the instructions on the card. 
 So this one ...,"Change instrument roles.",Yeah, everyone swap instruments --nDrummer on the piano --,Brilliant, brilliant idea. 
 "Look closely at the most nembarrassing details. Amplify them." 
 "Make a sudden, destructive,nunpredictable action. Incorporate." 
 These cards are disruptive. 
 Now, they've proved their worthnin album after album.,The musicians hate them. 
 (Laughter) 
 So Phil Collins was playing drumsnon an early Brian Eno album.,He got so frustrated he startednthrowing beer cans across the studio. 
 Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,,working with Enonon David Bowie's "Lodger" album,,and at one pointnhe turns to Brian and says,,"Brian, this experiment is stupid.",But the thing isnit was a pretty good album,,but also,,Carlos Alomar, 35 years later,nnow uses The Oblique Strategies.,And he tells his studentsnto use The Oblique Strategies,because he's realized something.,Just because you don't like itndoesn't mean it isn't helping you. 
 The strategies actuallynweren't a deck of cards originally,,they were just a list --,list on the recording studio wall.,A checklist of thingsnyou might try if you got stuck. 
 The list didn't work.,Know why?,Not messy enough.,Your eye would go down the list,and it would settle on whatevernwas the least disruptive,,the least troublesome,,which of course misses the point entirely. 
 And what Brian Eno came to realize was,,yes, we need to runnthe stupid experiments,,we need to dealnwith the awkward strangers,,we need to try to read the ugly fonts.,These things help us.,They help us solve problems,,they help us be more creative. 
 But also ...,we really need some persuasionnif we're going to accept this.,So however we do it ...,whether it's sheer willpower,,whether it's the flip of a card,or whether it's a guilt tripnfrom a German teenager,,all of us, from time to time,,need to sit down and try and playnthe unplayable piano. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Code is the next universal language.,In the seventies, it was punk musicnthat drove the whole generation.,In the eighties, it was probably money.,But for my generation of people,,software is the interfacento our imagination and our world.,And that means that we need,a radically, radicallynmore diverse set of people,to build those products,,to not see computers as mechanicalnand lonely and boring and magic,,to see them as thingsnthat they can tinker,and turn around and twist,nand so forth. 
 My personal journey into the worldnof programming and technology,started at the tender age of 14.,I had this mad teenage crushnon an older man,,and the older man in questionnjust happened to be,the then Vice Presidentnof the United States, Mr. Al Gore.,And I did what every singlenteenage girl would want to do.,I wanted to somehownexpress all of this love,,so I built him a website, it's over here.,And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,,there was no Facebook,nthere was no Pinterest.,So I needed to learn to code,in order to expressnall of this longing and loving. 
 And that is how programmingnstarted for me.,It started as a means of self-expression.,Just like when I was smaller,nI would use crayons and legos.,And when I was older, I would usenguitar lessons and theater plays.,But then, there were other thingsnto get excited about,,like poetry and knitting socks,and conjugating French irregular verbs,and coming up with make-believe worlds,and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.,And I started to be one of those people,who felt that computersnare boring and technical and lonely. 
 Here's what I think today.,Little girls don't know that theynare not supposed to like computers.,Little girls are amazing.,They are really, really goodnat concentrating on things,and being exact and they asknamazing questions like,,"What?" and "Why?"nand "How?" and "What if?",And they don't know that theynare not supposed to like computers.,It's the parents who do.,It's us parents who feel,like computer sciencenis this esoteric, weird science discipline,that only belongs to the mystery makers.,That it's almost as far removednfrom everyday life,as, say, nuclear physics. 
 And they are partly right about that.,There's a lot of syntaxnand controls and data structures,and algorithms and practices,,protocols and paradigms in programming.,And we as a community,nwe've made computers smaller and smaller.,We've built layers and layersnof abstraction on top of each other,between the man and the machine,to the point that we no longernhave any idea how computers work,or how to talk to them.,And we do teach our kidsnhow the human body works,,we teach them hownthe combustion engine functions,and we even tell themnthat if you want to really be an astronaut,you can become one.,But when the kid comes to us and asks,,"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?",Or, "How does the computer knownwhat happens when I press 'play,',how does it know which video to show?",Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?",We adults, we grow oddly silent.,"It's magic," some of us say.,"It's too complicated," the others say. 
 Well, it's neither.,It's not magic and it's not complicated.,It all just happenednreally, really, really fast.,Computer scientists builtnthese amazing, beautiful machines,,but they made themnvery, very foreign to us,,and also the language we speaknto the computers,so that we don't knownhow to speak to the computers anymore,without our fancy user interfaces. 
 And that's why no one recognized,that when I was conjugatingnFrench irregular verbs,,I was actually practicingnmy pattern recognition skills.,And when I was excited about knitting,,I actually was followingna sequence of symbolic commands,that included loops inside of them.,And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest,to find an exact languagenbetween English and mathematics,found its home inside of a computer.,I was a programmer, but no one knew it. 
 The kids of today, they tap, swipenand pinch their way through the world.,But unless we give them toolsnto build with computers,,we are raising only consumersninstead of creators. 
 This whole questnled me to this little girl.,Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.,She is completely fearless,nimaginative and a little bit bossy.,And every timenI would run into a problem,in trying to teachnmyself programming like,,"What is object-oriented designnor what is garbage collection?",,I would try to imagine how a six-year-oldnlittle girl would explain the problem. 
 And I wrote a book about hernand I illustrated it,and the thingsnRuby taught me go like this.,Ruby taught me that you'rennot supposed to be afraid,of the bugs under your bed.,And even the biggest of the problems,are a group of tiny problemsnstuck together.,And Ruby also introducednme to her friends,,the colorful side of the Internet culture.,She has friends like the Snow Leopard,,who is beautiful but doesn't wantnto play with the other kids.,And she has friends like the green robotsnthat are really friendly but super messy.,And she has friends like Linux the penguin,who's really ruthlessly efficient,nbut somewhat hard to understand.,And idealistic foxes, and so on. 
 In Ruby's world, you learnntechnology through play.,And, for instance, computersnare really good at repeating stuff,,so the way Ruby would teachnloops goes like this.,This is Ruby's favorite dance move,nit goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp,clap, clap and jump.",And you learn counter loopsnby repeating that four times.,And you learn while loopsnby repeating that sequence,while I'm standing on one leg.,And you learn until loopsnby repeating that sequence,until mom gets really mad.,(Laughter),And most of all, you learnnthat there are no ready answers. 
 When coming up with the curriculumnfor Ruby's world,,I needed to really ask the kidsnhow they see the world,and what kind of questions they have,and I would organizenplay testing sessions.,I would start by showing the kidsnthese four pictures.,I would show them a picture of a car,,a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.,And I would ask, "Which one of thesendo you think is a computer?",And the kids would benvery conservative and go,,"None of these is a computer.,I know what a computer is:,it's that glowing box,in front of which mom or dadnspends way too much time.",But then we would talk,and we would discovernthat actually, a car is a computer,,it has a navigation system inside of it.,And a dog -- a dognmight not be a computer,,but it has a collar,and the collar might havena computer inside of it.,And grocery stores, they havenso many different kinds of computers,,like the cashier systemnand the burglar alarms.,And kids, you know what?,In Japan, toilets are computers,and there's even hackers who hack them.,(Laughter) 
 And we go further,and I give them these little stickersnwith an on/off button on them.,And I tell the kids,n"Today you have this magic ability,to make anything in this roomninto a computer.",And again, the kids go,,"Sounds really hard,nI don't know the right answer for this.",But I tell them, "Don't worry,,your parents don't knownthe right answer, either.,They've just startednto hear about this thing,called The Internet of Things.,But you kids,nyou are going to be the ones,who are really going to live up in a worldnwhere everything is a computer." 
 And then I had this little girlnwho came to me,and took a bicycle lamp,and she said, "This bicycle lamp,nif it were a computer,,it would change colors.",And I said, "That's a really good idea,nwhat else could it do?",And she thinks and she thinks,,and she goes, "If this bicycle lampnwere a computer,,we could go on a biking tripnwith my father,and we would sleep in a tent,and this biking lampncould also be a movie projector.",And that's the moment I'm looking for,,the moment when the kid realizes,that the worldnis definitely not ready yet,,that a really awesome waynof making the world more ready,is by building technology,and that each one of usncan be a part of that change. 
 Final story, we also built a computer.,And we got to know the bossy CPUnand the helpful RAM and ROM,that help it remember things.,And after we've assemblednour computer together,,we also design an application for it.,And my favorite story is this little boy,,he's six years old,and his favorite thing in the worldnis to be an astronaut.,And the boy, he hasnthese huge headphones on,and he's completely immersednin his tiny paper computer,because you see, he's built his own,intergalactic planetarynnavigation application.,And his father, the lone astronautnin the Martian orbit,,is on the other side of the room,and the boy's important mission,is to bring the fathernsafely back to earth.,And these kids are going to havena profoundly different view of the world,and the way we build it with technology. 
 Finally, the more approachable,nthe more inclusive,,and the more diversenwe make the world of technology,,the more colorful and betternthe world will look like.,So, imagine with me, for a moment,,a world where the stories we tell,about how things get madendon't only include,the twentysomething-year-oldnSilicon Valley boys,,but also Kenyan schoolgirlsnand Norwegian librarians.,Imagine a world wherenthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,,who live in a permanentnreality of 1s and 0s,,they grow up to be very optimisticnand brave about technology.,They embrace the powersnand the opportunities,and the limitations of the world.,A world of technologynthat is wonderful, whimsical,and a tiny bit weird. 
 When I was a girl,,I wanted to be a storyteller.,I loved make-believe worlds,and my favorite thing to do,was to wake up in the morningsnin Moominvalley.,In the afternoons,nI would roam around the Tatooines.,And in the evenings,nI would go to sleep in Narnia.,And programming turned outnto be the perfect profession for me.,I still create worlds.,Instead of stories, I do them with code. 
 Programming gives me this amazing power,to build my whole little universe,with its own rulesnand paradigms and practices.,Create something out of nothingnwith the pure power of logic. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, I am going to show you,how this tablet and this virtual-realitynheadset that I'm wearing,are going to completelynrevolutionize science education.,And I'm also going to show you,how it can make any science teachernmore than twice as effective.,But before I show younhow all of this is possible,,let's talk briefly about why improvingnthe quality of science education,is so vitally important. 
 If you think about it,,the world is growing incredibly fast.,And with that growth comesna whole list of growing challenges,,challenges such as dealingnwith global warming,,solving starvation and water shortages,and curing diseases,,to name just a few. 
 And who, exactly, is going to help usnsolve all of these great challenges?,Well, to a very last degree,nit is these young students.,This is the next generationnof young, bright scientists.,And in many ways, we all rely on them,for coming up with new, great innovations,to help us solve allnthese challenges ahead of us.,And so a couple of years back,,my cofounder and I were teachingnuniversity students just like these,,only the students we were teachingnlooked a little bit more like this here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yes, this is reallynthe reality out there,in way too many universitiesnaround the world:,students that are bored, disengaged,and sometimes not even surenwhy they're learning about a topic,in the first place. 
 So we started looking around for new,ninnovative teaching methods,,but what we found was quite disappointing.,We saw that books were beingnturned into e-books,,blackboards were being turnedninto YouTube videos,and lecture hall monologuesnwere being turned into MOOCs --,massive online open courses.,And if you think about it,,all we're really doing herenis taking the same content,and the same format,,and bringing it out to more students --,which is great, don't get menwrong, that is really great --,but the teaching methodnis still more or less the same,,no real innovation there. 
 So we started looking elsewhere.,What we found was that flight simulatorsnhad been proven over and over again,to be far more effective,when used in combination with real,nin-flight training to train the pilots.,And so we thought to ourselves:,Why not just apply that to science?,Why not build a virtualnlaboratory simulator? 
 Well, we did it.,We basically set out to create,a fully simulated, one-to-one,nvirtual reality laboratory simulator,,where the studentsncould perform experiments,with mathematical equations,that would simulate what wouldnhappen in a real-world lab.,But not just simple simulations --,we would also create advanced simulations,with top universities like MIT,,to bring out cutting-edge cancernresearch to these students.,And suddenly, the universitiesncould save millions of dollars,by letting the studentsnperform virtual experiments,before they go into the real laboratory.,And not only that; now,nthey could also understand --,even on a molecular levelninside the machine --,what is happening to the machines.,And then they could suddenly perform,dangerous experiments in the labs as well.,For instance also here,,learning about salmonella bacteria,nwhich is an important topic,that many schools cannot teachnfor good safety reasons.,And we, of course, quiz the students,and then give the teachersna full dashboard,,so they fully understandnwhere the students are at. 
 But we didn't stop there,,because we had seen justnhow important meaning is,for the students' engagement in the class.,So we brought in game designers,to create fun and engaging stories.,For instance, here in this case,,where the students have to solvena mysterious CSI murder case,using their core science skills. 
 And the feedback we gotnwhen we launched all of this,was quite overwhelmingly positive.,Here we have 300 students,,all passionately solving CSI murder cases,while learning core science skills.,And what I love the most about this,is really when the studentsncome up to me sometimes afterwards,,all surprised and a little confused,,and say, "I just spent two hoursnin this virtual lab,,and ... and I didn't check Facebook." 
 (Laughter) 
 That's how engaging and immersiventhis really is for the students. 
 And so, to investigatenwhether this really worked,,a learning psychologistndid a study with 160 students --,that was from Stanford Universitynand Technical University of Denmark.,And what they did is splitnthe students into two groups.,One group would only usenthe virtual laboratory simulations,,the other group would only usentraditional teaching methods,,and they had the same amount of time.,Then, interestingly,,they gave the students a testnbefore and after the experiment,,so they could clearly measurenthe learning impact of the students.,And what they found,was a surprisingly high 76 percentnincrease in the learning effectiveness,when using virtual laboratoriesnover traditional teaching methods. 
 But even more interestingly,,the second part of this study investigated,what the teacher's impactnwas on the learning.,And what they found,was that when you combinednthe virtual laboratories,with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,,then we saw a total 101 percentnincrease in the learning effectiveness,,which effectively doublesnthe science teacher's impact,with the same amount of time spent.,So a couple of months back,,we started asking ourselves --,we have a wonderful team nownof learning psychologists,and teachers and scientistsnand game developers --,and we started asking ourselves:,How can we keep ourselves to our promise,of constantly reimagining education? 
 And today, I am really excitednto be presenting what we came up with,and have been workingnincredibly hard to create.,I will explain briefly what this is.,Basically, I take my mobile phone --,most students alreadynhave these, smartphones --,and I plug it into this virtual-realitynheadset, a low-cost headset.,And now what I can effectively do is,,I can literally stepninto this virtual world.,We'll have some of younin the audience also get to try this,,because it is really somethingnthat you have to try,to fully feel how immersive it really is.,It literally feels like I just steppedninside this virtual lab.,Do you see me up on the screen? 
 Audience: Yes. 
 Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome. 
 So basically, I have justnturned my mobile phone,into a fully simulated, million-dollarnIvy League laboratory,with all this amazing equipmentnthat I can interact with.,I can, for instance, pick up the pipettenand do experiments with it.,I have my E-Ggel, my PCRnand -- oh, look there,,I have my next-generationnsequencing machine,,and there I even havenmy electron microscope.,I mean, who's carrying aroundnan electron microscope in their pocket?,And here I have my machine,,I can do different experimentsnon the machine.,And over here I have the door,,I can go into other experiments,,I can perform in the laboratories.,And here, I have my learning tablet.,This is an intelligent tablet,that allows me to readnabout relevant theory.,As you can see, I can interact with it.,I can watch videos and seencontent that is relevant,to the experimentnthat I'm performing right now.,Then over here, I have Marie.,She is my teacher --nmy lab assistant --,and what she does is guides menthrough this whole laboratory.,And very soon,,the teachers will be ablento literally teleport themselves,into this virtual worldnthat I'm in right now,and help me, guide me,nthrough this whole experiment. 
 And now before I finalize this,,I want to show younan even cooler thing, I think --,something you cannotneven do in real laboratories.,This is a PCR machine.,I'm now going to start this experiment.,And what I just did is literallynshrunk myself a million times,into the size of a molecule --,and it really feels like it,nyou have to try this.,So now it feels likenI'm standing inside the machine,and I'm seeing all the DNA,nand I see the molecules.,I see the polymerasenand the enzymes and so forth.,And I can see how in this case,,DNA is being replicated millions of times,,just like it's happeningninside your body right now.,And I can really feel and understandnhow all of this works. 
 Now, I hope that gives youna little bit of a sense,of the possibilitiesnin these new teaching methods.,And I want to also emphasize,that everything you just sawnalso works on iPads and laptops,without the headsets.,I say that for a very important reason.,In order for us to reallynempower and inspire,the next generation of scientists,,we really need teachersnto drive the adoption,of new technologies in the classroom.,And so in many ways,,I believe that the next big,nquantum leap in science education,lies no longer with the technology,,but rather with the teachers' decision,to push forward and adoptnthese technologies,inside the classrooms.,And so it is our hope that morenuniversities and schools and teachers,will collaborate with technology companies,to realize this full potential. 
 And so,,lastly, I'd like to leave younwith a little story,that really inspires me.,And that is the story of Jack Andraka.,Some of you might already know him.,Jack invented a new, groundbreakingnlow-cost test for pancreatic cancer,at the age 15.,And when Jack shares his storynof how he did this huge breakthrough,,he also explains that one thingnalmost prevented him,from making this breakthrough.,And that was that he did notnhave access to real laboratories,,because he was too inexperienced,to be allowed in. 
 Now, imagine if we could bring,Ivy League, million-dollarnvirtual laboratories,out to all these students just like Jack,,all over the world,,and give them the latest, greatest,nmost fancy machines you can imagine,that would quite literallynmake any scientist in here,jump up and down out of pure excitement.,And then imagine how thatnwould empower and inspire,a whole new generationnof young and bright scientists,,ready to innovate and change the world. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We've evolved with tools,nand tools have evolved with us.,Our ancestors created thesenhand axes 1.5 million years ago,,shaping them to not onlynfit the task at hand,but also their hand. 
 However, over the years,,tools have becomenmore and more specialized.,These sculpting toolsnhave evolved through their use,,and each one has a different formnwhich matches its function.,And they leveragenthe dexterity of our hands,in order to manipulate thingsnwith much more precision.,But as tools have becomenmore and more complex,,we need more complex controlsnto control them.,And so designers have becomenvery adept at creating interfaces,that allow you to manipulate parametersnwhile you're attending to other things,,such as taking a photographnand changing the focus,or the aperture. 
 But the computer has fundamentallynchanged the way we think about tools,because computation is dynamic.,So it can do a million different things,and run a million different applications.,However, computers haventhe same static physical form,for all of these different applications,and the same staticninterface elements as well.,And I believe that thisnis fundamentally a problem,,because it doesn't really allow usnto interact with our hands,and capture the rich dexteritynthat we have in our bodies.,And my belief is that, then,nwe must need new types of interfaces,that can capture thesenrich abilities that we have,and that can physically adapt to us,and allow us to interact in new ways.,And so that's what I've been doingnat the MIT Media Lab,and now at Stanford. 
 So with my colleagues,nDaniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii,,we created inFORM,,where the interface can actuallyncome off the screen,and you can physically manipulate it.,Or you can visualizen3D information physically,and touch it and feel itnto understand it in new ways.,Or you can interact through gesturesnand direct deformations,to sculpt digital clay.,Or interface elements can arisenout of the surface,and change on demand.,And the idea is that for eachnindividual application,,the physical form can be matchednto the application.,And I believe this represents a new way,that we can interact with information,,by making it physical. 
 So the question is, how can we use this?,Traditionally, urban plannersnand architects build physical models,of cities and buildingsnto better understand them.,So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab,nwe created an interface built on inFORM,to allow urban plannersnto design and view entire cities.,And now you can walk around it,nbut it's dynamic, it's physical,,and you can also interact directly.,Or you can look at different views,,such as population or traffic information,,but it's made physical. 
 We also believe that these dynamicnshape displays can really change,the ways that we remotelyncollaborate with people.,So when we're working together in person,,I'm not only looking at your face,but I'm also gesturingnand manipulating objects,,and that's really hard to donwhen you're using tools like Skype.,And so using inFORM,nyou can reach out from the screen,and manipulate things at a distance.,So we used the pins of the displaynto represent people's hands,,allowing them to actually touchnand manipulate objects at a distance.,And you can also manipulatenand collaborate on 3D data sets as well,,so you can gesture around themnas well as manipulate them.,And that allows people to collaboratenon these new types of 3D information,in a richer way than mightnbe possible with traditional tools.,And so you can alsonbring in existing objects,,and those will be captured on one sidenand transmitted to the other.,Or you can have an object that's linkednbetween two places,,so as I move a ball on one side,,the ball moves on the other as well.,And so we do this by capturingnthe remote user,using a depth-sensing cameranlike a Microsoft Kinect. 
 Now, you might be wonderingnhow does this all work,,and essentially, what it is,nis 900 linear actuators,that are connected to thesenmechanical linkages,that allow motion down herento be propagated in these pins above.,So it's not that complexncompared to what's going on at CERN,,but it did take a long timenfor us to build it.,And so we started with a single motor,,a single linear actuator,,and then we had to designna custom circuit board to control them.,And then we had to make a lot of them.,And so the problem with havingn900 of something,is that you have to donevery step 900 times.,And so that meant that we hadna lot of work to do.,So we sort of set upna mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab,and brought undergrads in and convincednthem to do "research" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and had late nightsnwatching movies, eating pizza,and screwing in thousands of screws.,You know -- research. 
 (Laughter) 
 But anyway, I think that we werenreally excited by the things,that inFORM allowed us to do.,Increasingly, we're using mobile devices,nand we interact on the go.,But mobile devices, just like computers,,are used for so manyndifferent applications.,So you use them to talk on the phone,,to surf the web, to play games,nto take pictures,or even a million different things.,But again, they have the samenstatic physical form,for each of these applications.,And so we wanted to know how can we takensome of the same interactions,that we developed for inFORM,and bring them to mobile devices. 
 So at Stanford, we creatednthis haptic edge display,,which is a mobile devicenwith an array of linear actuators,that can change shape,,so you can feel in your handnwhere you are as you're reading a book.,Or you can feel in your pocketnnew types of tactile sensations,that are richer than the vibration.,Or buttons can emerge from the sidenthat allow you to interact,where you want them to be.,Or you can play gamesnand have actual buttons.,And so we were able to do this,by embedding 40 small, tinynlinear actuators inside the device,,and that allow you not only to touch them,but also back-drive them as well. 
 But we've also looked at other waysnto create more complex shape change.,So we've used pneumatic actuationnto create a morphing device,where you can go from somethingnthat looks a lot like a phone ...,to a wristband on the go.,And so together with Ken Nakagakinat the Media Lab,,we created this newnhigh-resolution version,that uses an array of servomotorsnto change from interactive wristband,to a touch-input device,to a phone. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we're also interestednin looking at ways,that users can actuallyndeform the interfaces,to shape them into the devicesnthat they want to use.,So you can make somethingnlike a game controller,,and then the system will understandnwhat shape it's in,and change to that mode. 
 So, where does this point?,How do we move forward from here?,I think, really, where we are today,is in this new agenof the Internet of Things,,where we have computers everywhere --,they're in our pockets,nthey're in our walls,,they're in almost every devicenthat you'll buy in the next five years.,But what if we stoppednthinking about devices,and think instead about environments?,And so how can we have smart furniture,or smart rooms or smart environments,or cities that can adapt to us physically,,and allow us to do new waysnof collaborating with people,and doing new types of tasks? 
 So for the Milan Design Week,nwe created TRANSFORM,,which is an interactive table-scalenversion of these shape displays,,which can move physical objectsnon the surface; for example,,reminding you to take your keys.,But it can also transformnto fit different ways of interacting.,So if you want to work,,then it can change to sort ofnset up your work system.,And so as you bring a device over,,it creates all the affordances you need,and brings other objectsnto help you accomplish those goals. 
 So, in conclusion,,I really think that we need to thinknabout a new, fundamentally different way,of interacting with computers.,We need computersnthat can physically adapt to us,and adapt to the waysnthat we want to use them,and really harness the rich dexteritynthat we have of our hands,,and our ability to think spatiallynabout information by making it physical.,But looking forward, I think we neednto go beyond this, beyond devices,,to really think about new waysnthat we can bring people together,,and bring our information into the world,,and think about smart environmentsnthat can adapt to us physically.,So with that, I will leave you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could startnby just telling us about your country.,It's three dots there on the globe.nThose dots are pretty huge.,I think each onenis about the size of California.,Tell us about Kiribati. 
 Anote Tong: Well, let me first beginnby saying how deeply grateful I am,for this opportunity to share my storynwith people who do care.,I think I've been sharing my story withna lot of people who don't care too much.,But Kiribati is comprisednof three groups of islands:,the Gilbert Group on the west,,we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,,and the Line Islands in the east.,And quite frankly, Kiribatinis perhaps the only country,that is actuallynin the four corners of the world,,because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,nin the Southern Hemisphere,,and also in the east and the westnof the International Date Line.,These islands are entirelynmade up of coral atolls,,and on average aboutntwo meters above sea level.,And so this is what we have.,Usually not morenthan two kilometers in width.,And so, on many occasions,nI've been asked by people,,"You know, you're suffering,nwhy don't you move back?",They don't understand.,They have no conceptnof what it is that's involved.,With the rising sea, they say,n"Well, you can move back.",And so this is what I tell them.,If we move back, we will fall offnon the other side of the ocean. OK?,But these are the kinds of issuesnthat people don't understand. 
 CA: So certainly this isnjust a picture of fragility there.,When was it that you yourself realized,that there might benimpending peril for your country? 
 AT: Well, the story of climate changenhas been one that has been going on,for quite a number of decades.,And when I came into office in 2003,,I began talking about climate changenat the United Nations General Assembly,,but not with so much passion,,because then there was stillnthis controversy among the scientists,whether it was human-induced,nwhether it was real or it wasn't.,But I think that that debatenwas fairly much concluded in 2007,with the Fourth AssessmentnReport of the IPCC,,which made a categorical statementnthat it is real, it's human-induced,,and it's predictingnsome very serious scenarios,for countries like mine.,And so that's when I got very serious.,In the past, I talked about it.,We were worried.,But when the scenarios,nthe predictions came in 2007,,it became a real issue for us. 
 CA: Now, those predictions are,nI think, that by 2100,,sea levels are forecast to risenperhaps three feet.,There's scenarios wherenit's higher than that, for sure,,but what would you saynto a skeptic who said,,"What's three feet?,You're on averagensix feet above sea level.,What's the problem?" 
 AT: Well, I thinknit's got to be understood,that a marginal rise in sea level,would mean a loss of a lot of land,,because much of the land is low.,And quite apart from that,nwe are getting the swells at the moment.,So it's not about getting two feet.,I think what many people do not understand,is they think climate change is somethingnthat is happening in the future.,Well, we're at the verynbottom end of the spectrum.,It's already with us.,We have communitiesnwho already have been dislocated.,They have had to move,nand every parliament session,,I'm getting complaintsnfrom different communities,asking for assistance to build seawalls,,to see what we can donabout the freshwater lens,because it's being destroyed,,and so in my tripsnto the different islands,,I'm seeing evidence of communities,which are now having to copenwith the loss of food crops,,the contamination of the water lenses,,and I see these communitiesnperhaps leaving, having to relocate,,within five to 10 years. 
 CA: And then, I think the countrynsuffered its first cyclone,,and this is connected, yes?nWhat happened here? 
 AT: Well, we're on the equator,,and I'm sure many of you understandnthat when you're on the equator,,it's supposed to be in the doldrums.nWe're not supposed to get the cyclones.,We create them, and then we send themneither north or south. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they aren't supposed to come back.,But for the first time,nat the beginning of this year,,the Cyclone Pam,nwhich destroyed Vanuatu,,and in the process,nthe very edges of it actually touched,our two southernmost islands,,and all of Tuvalu was underwaternwhen Hurricane Pam struck.,But for our two southernmost islands,,we had waves come over half the island,,and so this has never happened before.,It's a new experience.,And I've just come backnfrom my own constituency,,and I've seen these beautiful treesnwhich had been there for decades,,they've been totally destroyed.,So this is what's happening,,but when we talknabout the rising sea level,,we think it's somethingnthat happens gradually.,It comes with the winds,nit comes with the swells,,and so they can be magnified,,but what we are beginning to witnessnis the change in the weather pattern,,which is perhaps the more urgent challenge,that we will face soonernthan perhaps the rising sea level. 
 CA: So the countrynis already seeing effects now.,As you look forward,,what are your optionsnas a country, as a nation? 
 AT: Well, I've been tellingnthis story every year.,I think I visit a number of --,I've been traveling the worldnto try and get people to understand.,We have a plan, we think we have a plan.,And on one occasion,nI think I spoke in Geneva,and there was a gentlemannwho was interviewing me,on something like this,,and I said, "We are lookingnat floating islands,",and he thought it was funny,nbut somebody said,,"No, this is not funny.nThese people are looking for solutions.",And so I have been lookingnat floating islands.,The Japanese are interestednin building floating islands. 
 But, as a country,nwe have made a commitment,that no matter what happens,nwe will try as much as possible,to stay and continue to exist as a nation.,What that will take,,it's going to bensomething quite significant,,very, very substantial.,Either we live on floating islands,,or we have to build up the islandsnto continue to stay out of the water,as the sea level risesnand as the storms get more severe.,But even that, it's going to benvery, very difficult,to get the kind of resourcingnthat we would need. 
 CA: And then the only recoursenis some form of forced migration. 
 AT: Well, we are also looking at that,because in the eventnthat nothing comes forward,from the international community,,we are preparing,,we don't want to be caughtnlike what's happening in Europe.,OK? We don't want to mass migratenat some point in time.,We want to be ablento give the people the choice today,,those who choosenand want to do that, to migrate.,We don't want something to happennthat they are forced to migrate,without having been prepared to do so.,Of course, our culture is very different,nour society is very different,,and once we migrateninto a different environment,,a different culture,,there's a whole lotnof adjustments that are required. 
 CA: Well, there's forced migrationnin your country's past,,and I think just this week,,just yesterdaynor the day before yesterday,,you visited these people.,What happened here? What's the story here? 
 AT: Yes, and I'm sorry,nI think somebody was asking,why we were sneaking offnto visit that place.,I had a very good reason, because we havena community of Kiribati people,living in that partnof the Solomon Islands,,but these were people who were relocatednfrom the Phoenix Islands, in fact,,in the 1960s.,There was serious drought, and the peoplencould not continue to live on the island,,and so they were movednto live here in the Solomon Islands.,And so yesterday it was very interestingnto meet with these people.,They didn't know who I was.nThey hadn't heard of me.,Some of them later recognized me,,but I think they were very happy.,Later they really wanted to haventhe opportunity to welcome me formally.,But I think what I saw yesterdaynwas very interesting,because here I see our people.,I spoke in our language, and of coursenthey spoke back, they replied,,but their accent, they are beginningnnot to be able to speak Kiribati properly.,I saw them, there wasnthis lady with red teeth.,She was chewing betel nuts,,and it's not something we do in Kiribati.,We don't chew betel nuts.,I met also a family who have marriednthe local people here,,and so this is what is happening.,As you go into another community,nthere are bound to be changes.,There is bound to bena certain loss of identity,,and this is what we will benlooking for in the future,if and when we do migrate. 
 CA: It must have beennjust an extraordinarily emotional day,because of these questions about identity,,the joy of seeing you and perhapsnan emphasized sense of what they had lost.,And it's very inspiring to hear you saynyou're going to fight to the end,to try to preserventhe nation in a location. 
 AT: This is our wish.,Nobody wants ever to leave their home,,and so it's beenna very difficult decision for me.,As a leader, you don't make plansnto leave your island, your home,,and so I've been askednon a number of occasions,,"So how do you feel?",And it doesn't feel good at all.,It's an emotional thing,nand I've tried to live with it,,and I know that on occasions, I'm accusednof not trying to solve the problem,because I can't solve the problem.,It's something that's gotnto be done collectively. 
 Climate change is a global phenomenon,nand as I've often argued,,unfortunately, the countries,nwhen we come to the United Nations --,I was in a meeting withnthe Pacific Island Forum countries,where Australia and New Zealandnare also members,,and we had an argument.,There was a bit of a story in the news,because they were arguingnthat to cut emissions,,it would be somethingnthat they're unable to do,because it would affect the industries.,And so here I was saying,,OK, I hear you,,I understand what you're saying,,but try also to understand what I'm saying,because if you do not cut your emissions,,then our survival is on the line.,And so it's a matter for younto weigh this, these moral issues.,It's about industry as opposed tonthe survival of a people. 
 CA: You know, I ask you yesterdaynwhat made you angry,,and you said, "I don't get angry."nBut then you paused.,I think this made you angry. 
 AT: I'd refer you to my earliernstatement at the United Nations.,I was very angry, very frustratednand then depressed.,There was a sense of futility,that we are fighting a fightnthat we have no hope of winning.,I had to change my approach.,I had to become more reasonable,because I thought people would listennto somebody who was rational,,but I remain radically rational,nwhatever that is. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: Now, a core partnof your nation's identity is fishing.,I think you said pretty much everyonenis involved in fishing in some way. 
 AT: Well, we eat fishnevery day, every day,,and I think there is no doubtnthat our rate of consumption of fish,is perhaps the highest in the world.,We don't have a lot of livestock,,so it's fish that we depend on. 
 CA: So you're dependent on fish,nboth at the local level,and for the revenuesnthat the country receives,from the global fishing business for tuna,,and yet despite that, a few years agonyou took a very radical step.,Can you tell us about that?,I think something happenednright here in the Phoenix Islands. 
 AT: Let me give some of the backgroundnof what fish means for us.,We have one of the largestntuna fisheries remaining in the world.,In the Pacific, I think we ownnsomething like 60 percent,of the remaining tuna fisheries,,and it remains relatively healthynfor some species, but not all.,And Kiribati is one of the threenmajor resource owners,,tuna resource owners.,And at the moment, we have been getting,something like 80 to 90npercent of our revenue,from access fees, license fees. 
 CA: Of your national revenue. 
 AT: National revenue,,which drives everything that we do,in governments, hospitals,nschools and what have you.,But we decided to close this,nand it was a very difficult decision.,I can assure you, politically,nlocally, it was not easy,,but I was convinced that we had to do this,in order to ensurenthat the fishery remains sustainable.,There had been some indicationsnthat some of the species,,in particular the bigeye,nwas under serious threat.,The yellowfin was also heavily fished.,Skipjack remains healthy.,And so we had to do something like that,nand so that was the reason I did that.,Another reason why I did that,was because I had been askingnthe international community,that in order to deal with climate change,nin order to fight climate change,,there has got to be sacrifice,nthere has got to be commitment.,So in asking the international communitynto make a sacrifice,,I thought we ourselvesnneed to make that sacrifice.,And so we made the sacrifice.,And forgoing commercial fishing,in the Phoenix Islands protected area,would mean a loss of revenue.,We are still trying to assessnwhat that loss would be,because we actually closed it offnat the beginning of this year,,and so we will see by the end of this year,what it means in termsnof the lost revenue. 
 CA: So there's so many thingsnplaying into this.,On the one hand,nit may prompt healthier fisheries.,I mean, how much are you ablento move the price up,that you charge for the remaining areas? 
 AT: The negotiationsnhave been very difficult,,but we have managednto raise the cost of a vessel day.,For any vesselnto come in to fish for a day,,we have raised the fee from --nit was $6,000 and $8,000,,now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.,And so there's beennthat significant increase.,But at the same time,nwhat's important to note is,,whereas in the past these fishing boats,might be fishing in a daynand maybe catch 10 tons,,now they're catching maybe 100 tonsnbecause they've become so efficient.,And so we've got to respond likewise.,We've got to be very, very carefulnbecause the technology has so improved.,There was a time when the Brazilian fleetnmoved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.,They couldn't.,They started experimentingnif they could, per se.,But now they've got ways of doing it,nand they've become so efficient. 
 CA: Can you give us a sensenof what it's like in those negotiations?,Because you're up against companies,that have hundreds of millionsnof dollars at stake, essentially.,How do you hold the line?,Is there any advice you can give,to other leaders who are dealingnwith the same companies,about how to getnthe most for your country,,get the most for the fish?,What advice would you give? 
 AT: Well, I think we focusntoo often on licensing,in order to get the rate of return,,because what we are gettingnfrom license fees,is about 10 percentnof the landed value of the catch,on the side of the wharf,nnot in the retail shops.,And we only get about 10 percent.,What we have been tryingnto do over the years,is actually to increasenour participation in the industry,,in the harvesting, in the processing,,and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.,They're not easy to penetrate,,but we are working towards that,,and yes, the answer would be to enhance.,In order to increase our rate of return,nwe have to become more involved.,And so we've started doing that,,and we have to restructure the industry.,We've got to tell these peoplenthat the world has changed.,Now we want to produce the fish ourselves. 
 CA: And meanwhile,nfor your local fishermen,,they are still able to fish,,but what is business like for them?,Is it getting harder?nAre the waters depleted?,Or is that being runnon a sustainable basis? 
 AT: For the artisanal fishery,,we do not participatenin the commercial fishing activity,except only to supply the domestic market.,The tuna fishery is reallynentirely for the foreign market,,mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.,So I am a fisherman, very much,,and I used to be able to catch yellowfin.,Now it's very, very rarento be able to catch yellowfin,because they are being liftednout of the water by the hundreds of tons,by these purse seiners. 
 CA: So here's a couplenof beautiful girls from your country.,I mean, as you think about their future,,what message would you have for them,and what messagenwould you have for the world? 
 AT: Well, I've been telling the worldnthat we really have to do something,about what is happening to the climate,because for us, it's aboutnthe future of these children.,I have 12 grandchildren, at least.,I think I have 12, my wife knows. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think I have eight children.,It's about their future.,Every day I see my grandchildren,nabout the same age as these young girls,,and I do wonder,,and I get angry sometimes, yes I do.,I wonder what is to become of them.,And so it's about them,that we should be telling everybody,,that it's not aboutntheir own national interest,,because climate change,nregrettably, unfortunately,,is viewed by many countriesnas a national problem. It's not.,And this is the argumentnwe got into recently with our partners,,the Australians and New Zealanders,,because they said,n"We can't cut any more.",This is what one of the leaders,nthe Australian leader, said,,that we've done our part,nwe are cutting back.,I said, What about the rest?nWhy don't you keep it?,If you could keepnthe rest of your emissions,within your boundaries,nwithin your borders,,we'd have no question.,You can go ahead as much as you like.,But unfortunately,nyou're sending it our way,,and it's affectingnthe future of our children.,And so surely I think that is the heartnof the problem of climate change today. 
 We will be meeting in Parisnat the end of this year,,but until we can think of thisnas a global phenomenon,,because we create it,nindividually, as nations,,but it affects everybody else,,and yet, we refusento do anything about it,,and we deal with it as a national problem,,which it is not -- it is a global issue,,and it's got to bendealt with collectively. 
 CA: People are incredibly badnat responding to graphs and numbers,,and we shut our minds to it.,Somehow, to people, we're slightly betternat responding to that sometimes.,And it seems like it'snvery possible that your nation,,despite, actually because ofnthe intense problems you face,,you may yet be the warning lightnto the world that shines most visibly,,most powerfully.,I just want to thank you, nI'm sure, on behalf of all of us,,for your extraordinary leadershipnand for being here. 
 Mr. President, thank you so much. 
 AT: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Have you ever wonderednwhat animals think and feel?,Let's start with a question:,Does my dog really love me,nor does she just want a treat?,Well, it's easy to seenthat our dog really loves us,,easy to see, right,,what's going on in that fuzzy little head.,What is going on?,Something's going on. 
 But why is the question alwaysndo they love us?,Why is it always about us?,Why are we such narcissists?,I found a different questionnto ask animals.,Who are you? 
 There are capacities of the human mind,that we tend to think are capacitiesnonly of the human mind.,But is that true?,What are other beingsndoing with those brains?,What are they thinking and feeling?,Is there a way to know?,I think there is a way in.,I think there are several ways in.,We can look at evolution,nwe can look at their brains,and we can watch what they do. 
 The first thing to remember is:nour brain is inherited.,The first neurons came from jellyfish.,Jellyfish gave risento the first chordates.,The first chordates gave risento the first vertebrates.,The vertebrates came out of the sea,,and here we are.,But it's still true that a neuron,na nerve cell, looks the same,in a crayfish, a bird or you.,What does that saynabout the minds of crayfish?,Can we tell anything about that?,Well, it turns out thatnif you give a crayfish,a lot of little tiny electric shocks,every time it triesnto come out of its burrow,,it will develop anxiety.,If you give the crayfish the same drug,used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,,it relaxes and comes out and explores.,How do we show how muchnwe care about crayfish anxiety?,Mostly, we boil them. 
 (Laughter) 
 Octopuses use tools,nas well as do most apes,and they recognize human faces.,How do we celebrate the ape-likenintelligence of this invertebrate?,Mostly boiled.,If a grouper chases a fishninto a crevice in the coral,,it will sometimes go to where it knowsna moray eel is sleeping,and it will signalnto the moray, "Follow me,",and the moray will understand that signal.,The moray may go into the crevicenand get the fish,,but the fish may boltnand the grouper may get it.,This is an ancient partnership that wenhave just recently found out about.,How do we celebratenthat ancient partnership?,Mostly fried.,A pattern is emerging and it saysna lot more about us,than it does about them. 
 Sea otters use tools,and they take time awaynfrom what they're doing,to show their babies what to do,nwhich is called teaching.,Chimpanzees don't teach.,Killer whales teachnand killer whales share food. 
 When evolution makes something new,,it uses the parts it hasnin stock, off the shelf,,before it fabricates a new twist.,And our brain has come to us,through the enormitynof the deep sweep of time.,If you look at the human brainncompared to a chimpanzee brain,,what you see is we have basicallyna very big chimpanzee brain.,It's a good thing ours is bigger,nbecause we're also really insecure. 
 (Laughter) 
 But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,,a bigger brain with more convolutions.,OK, maybe you're saying,nall right, well, we see brains,,but what does thatnhave to say about minds?,Well, we can see the working of the mind,in the logic of behaviors.,So these elephants, you can see,,obviously, they are resting.,They have found a patch of shadenunder the palm trees,under which to let their babies sleep,,while they doze but remain vigilant.,We make perfect sense of that image,just as they make perfect sensenof what they're doing,because under the arc of the same sunnon the same plains,,listening to the howlsnof the same dangers,,they became who they arenand we became who we are. 
 We've been neighbors for a very long time.,No one would mistakenthese elephants as being relaxed.,They're obviously verynconcerned about something.,What are they concerned about?,It turns out that if you recordnthe voices of tourists,and you play that recordingnfrom a speaker hidden in bushes,,elephants will ignore it,nbecause tourists never bother elephants.,But if you record the voices of herders,who carry spears and often hurt elephantsnin confrontations at water holes,,the elephants will bunch upnand run away from the hidden speaker.,Not only do elephants knownthat there are humans,,they know that there arendifferent kinds of humans,,and that some are OKnand some are dangerous. 
 They have been watching us for much longernthan we have been watching them.,They know us better than we know them.,We have the same imperatives:,take care of our babies,nfind food, try to stay alive.,Whether we're outfitted for hikingnin the hills of Africa,or outfitted for diving under the sea,nwe are basically the same.,We are kin under the skin.,The elephant has the same skeleton,,the killer whale has the same skeleton,,as do we.,We see helping where help is needed.,We see curiosity in the young.,We see the bonds of family connections.,We recognize affection.,Courtship is courtship.,And then we ask, "Are they conscious?" 
 When you get general anesthesia,nit makes you unconscious,,which means you havenno sensation of anything.,Consciousness is simplynthe thing that feels like something.,If you see, if you hear, if you feel,nif you're aware of anything,,you are conscious, and they are conscious. 
 Some people say,well, there are certain thingsnthat make humans humans,,and one of those things is empathy.,Empathy is the mind's abilitynto match moods with your companions.,It's a very useful thing.,If your companions start to move quickly,,you have to feel likenyou need to hurry up.,We're all in a hurry now.,The oldest form of empathynis contagious fear.,If your companions suddenlynstartle and fly away,,it does not work very well for you to say,,"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left." 
 (Laughter) 
 Empathy is old, but empathy,nlike everything else in life,,comes on a sliding scalenand has its elaboration.,So there's basic empathy:nyou feel sad, it makes me sad.,I see you happy, it makes me happy. 
 Then there's somethingnthat I call sympathy,,a little more removed:,"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmothernhas just passed away.,I don't feel that same grief,nbut I get it; I know what you feel,and it concerns me." 
 And then if we're motivatednto act on sympathy,,I call that compassion. 
 Far from being the thingnthat makes us human,,human empathy is far from perfect.,We round up empathic creatures,nwe kill them and we eat them.,Now, maybe you say OK,nwell, those are different species.,That's just predation,nand humans are predators.,But we don't treat our own kindntoo well either.,People who seem to knownonly one thing about animal behavior,know that you must never attributenhuman thoughts and emotions,to other species.,Well, I think that's silly,,because attributing human thoughtsnand emotions to other species,is the best first guess about whatnthey're doing and how they're feeling,,because their brainsnare basically the same as ours.,They have the same structures.,The same hormones that createnmood and motivation in us,are in those brains as well.,It is not scientific to say that theynare hungry when they're hunting,and they're tired whenntheir tongues are hanging out,,and then say when they're playingnwith their children,and acting joyful and happy,,we have no idea if they can possiblynbe experiencing anything.,That is not scientific. 
 So OK, so a reporter said to me,,"Maybe, but how do you really knownthat other animals can think and feel?",And I started to riflenthrough all the hundreds,of scientific referencesnthat I put in my book,and I realized that the answernwas right in the room with me.,When my dog gets off the rugnand comes over to me --,not to the couch, to me --,and she rolls over on her backnand exposes her belly,,she has had the thought,n"I would like my belly rubbed.,I know that I can go over to Carl,,he will understand what I'm asking.,I know I can trust himnbecause we're family.,He'll get the job done,nand it will feel good." 
 (Laughter) 
 She has thought and she has felt,,and it's really notnmore complicated than that. 
 But we see other animalsnand we say, "Oh look, killer whales,,wolves, elephants:,that's not how they see it." 
 That tall-finned male is L41.,He's 38 years old.,The female right on his left side is L22.,She's 44.,They've known each other for decades.,They know exactly who they are.,They know who their friends are.,They know who their rivals are.,Their life follows the arc of a career.,They know where they are all the time. 
 This is an elephant named Philo.,He was a young male.,This is him four days later.,Humans not only can feel grief,nwe create an awful lot of it.,We want to carve their teeth.,Why can't we wait for them to die?,Elephants once ranged from the shoresnof the Mediterranean Sea,all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.,In 1980, there were vastnstrongholds of elephant range,in Central and Eastern Africa.,And now their range is shatteredninto little shards.,This is the geography of an animalnthat we are driving to extinction,,a fellow being, the mostnmagnificent creature on land. 
 Of course, we take much better carenof our wildlife in the United States.,In Yellowstone National Park,nwe killed every single wolf.,We killed every single wolfnsouth of the Canadian border, actually.,But in the park, park rangersndid that in the 1920s,,and then 60 years laternthey had to bring them back,,because the elk numbersnhad gotten out of control.,And then people came.,People came by the thousandsnto see the wolves,,the most accessiblynvisible wolves in the world. 
 And I went there and I watchednthis incredible family of wolves.,A pack is a family.,It has some breeding adultsnand the young of several generations.,And I watched the most famous, most stablenpack in Yellowstone National Park.,And then, when they wanderednjust outside the border,,two of their adults were killed,,including the mother,,which we sometimes call the alpha female.,The rest of the family immediatelyndescended into sibling rivalry.,Sisters kicked out other sisters.,That one on the left tried for daysnto rejoin her family.,They wouldn't let hernbecause they were jealous of her.,She was getting too much attentionnfrom two new males,,and she was the precocious one.,That was too much for them.,She wound up wanderingnoutside the park and getting shot.,The alpha male wound upnbeing ejected from his own family.,As winter was coming in,,he lost his territory,nhis hunting support,,the members of his family and his mate. 
 We cause so much pain to them.,The mystery is, why don'tnthey hurt us more than they do?,This whale had just finished eatingnpart of a grey whale,with his companionsnwho had killed that whale.,Those people in the boatnhad nothing at all to fear.,This whale is T20.,He had just finished tearing a sealninto three pieces with two companions.,The seal weighed about as muchnas the people in the boat.,They had nothing to fear.,They eat seals.,Why don't they eat us?,Why can we trust them around our toddlers?,Why is it that killer whales have returnednto researchers lost in thick fog,and led them miles until the fog parted,and the researchers' homenwas right there on the shoreline?,And that's happened more than one time. 
 In the Bahamas, there's a womannnamed Denise Herzing,,and she studies spotted dolphinsnand they know her.,She knows them very well.nShe knows who they all are.,They know her.nThey recognize the research boat.,When she shows up,nit's a big happy reunion.,Except, one time showed up and theyndidn't want to come near the boat,,and that was really strange.,And they couldn't figure outnwhat was going on,until somebody came out on deck,and announced that onenof the people onboard had died,during a nap in his bunk.,How could dolphins knownthat one of the human hearts,had just stopped?,Why would they care?,And why would it spook them?,These mysterious things just hint atnall of the things that are going on,in the minds that are with us on Earth,that we almost never think about at all. 
 At an aquarium in South Africa,was a little baby bottle-nosedndolphin named Dolly.,She was nursing, and one dayna keeper took a cigarette break,and he was looking into the windowninto their pool, smoking.,Dolly came over and looked at him,,went back to her mother,nnursed for a minute or two,,came back to the window,and released a cloud of milknthat enveloped her head like smoke.,Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin,got the idea of using milknto represent smoke.,When human beings use one thingnto represent another,,we call that art. 
 (Laughter) 
 The things that make us human,are not the thingsnthat we think make us human.,What makes us human is that,,of all these things that our mindsnand their minds have,,we are the most extreme.,We are the most compassionate,,most violent, most creative,and most destructive animalnthat has ever been on this planet,,and we are all of those thingsnall jumbled up together.,But love is not the thingnthat makes us human.,It's not special to us.,We are not the only onesnwho care about our mates.,We are not the only onesnwho care about our children. 
 Albatrosses frequently fly six,nsometimes ten thousand miles,over several weeks to delivernone meal, one big meal,,to their chick who is waiting for them.,They nest on the most remote islandsnin the oceans of the world,,and this is what it looks like.,Passing life from one generationnto the next is the chain of being.,If that stops, it all goes away.,If anything is sacred, that is,nand into that sacred relationship,comes our plastic trash.,All of these birdsnhave plastic in them now.,This is an albatross six months old,nready to fledge --,died, packed with red cigarette lighters. 
 This is not the relationshipnwe are supposed to have,with the rest of the world.,But we, who have namednourselves after our brains,,never think about the consequences.,When we welcome newnhuman life into the world,,we welcome our babiesninto the company of other creatures.,We paint animals on the walls.,We don't paint cell phones.,We don't paint work cubicles.,We paint animals to show themnthat we are not alone.,We have company.,And every one of those animalsnin every painting of Noah's ark,,deemed worthy of salvationnis in mortal danger now,,and their flood is us. 
 So we started with a question:,Do they love us?,We're going to ask another question.,Are we capable of using what we have,to care enough to simplynlet them continue? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a marine biologistnand an explorer-photographer,with National Geographic,,but I want to share a secret.,This image is totally incorrect,,totally incorrect.,I see a couple of peoplencrying in the back,that I've blown their idea of mermaids.,All right, the mermaid is indeed real,,but anyone who's gone on a dive,will know that the oceannlooks more like this.,It's because the oceannis this massive filter,,and as soon as you start going underwater,,you're going to lose your colors,,and it's going to get darknand blue very quickly. 
 But we're humans --nwe're terrestrial mammals.,And we've got trichromatic vision,,so we see in red, green and blue,,and we're just complete color addicts.,We love eye-popping color,,and we try to bring this eye-popping color,underwater with us. 
 So there's been a long and sordid historynof bringing color underwater,,and it starts 88 years agonwith Bill Longley and Charles Martin,,who were trying to takenthe first underwater color photograph.,And they're in therenwith old-school scuba suits,,where you're pumping air down to them,,and they've got a pontoonnof high-explosive magnesium powder,,and the poor peoplenat the surface are not sure,when they're going to pull the stringnwhen they've got their frame in focus,,and -- boom! -- a poundnof high explosives would go off,so they could putna little bit of light underwater,and get an imagenlike this beautiful hogfish.,I mean, it's a gorgeous image,nbut this is not real.,They're creating an artificial environment,so we can satisfynour own addiction to color. 
 And looking at it the other way,nwhat we've been finding,is that instead of bringing colornunderwater with us,,that we've been looking at the blue ocean,,and it's a crucible of blue,,and these animals living therenfor millions of years,have been evolving all sorts of waysnto take in that blue light,and give off other colors.,And here's just a little samplenof what this secret world looks like.,It's like an underwater light show. 
 (Music) 
 Again, what we're seeing herenis blue light hitting this image.,These animals are absorbing the blue light,and immediately transforming this light. 
 So if you think about it, the oceannis 71 percent of the planet,,and blue light can extend downnto almost a 1,000 meters.,As we go down underwater,,after about 10 meters,nall the red is gone.,So if you see anythingnunder 10 meters that's red,,it's an animal transformingnand creating its own red.,This is the largest single monochromaticnblue environment on our planet. 
 And my gateway into this worldnof biofluorescence begins with corals.,And I want to givena full TED Talk on corals,and just how cool these things are.,One of the things that they do,none of their miraculous feats,,is they produce lots of thesenfluorescent proteins,,fluorescent molecules.,And in this coral, it could be makingnup to 14 percent of its body mass --,could be this fluorescent protein.,So you wouldn't be making, like,n14 percent muscle and not using it,,so it's likely doing somethingnthat has a functional role.,And for the last 10, 15 years,nthis was so special to me,,because this molecule has turned outnto be one of the most revolutionary tools,in biomedical science,,and it's allowing usnto better see inside ourselves. 
 So, how do I study this?,In order to study biofluorescence,nwe swim at night.,And when I started out,,I was just using these bluenduct-tape filters over my strobe,,so I could make surenI'm actually seeing the light,that's being transformed by the animals.,We're making an exhibitnfor the Museum of Natural History,,and we're trying to show off how greatnthe fluorescent corals are on the reef,,and something happenednthat just blew me away:,this.,In the middle of our corals,,is this green fluorescent fish.,It's the first time we've ever seenna green fluorescent fish,or any vertebrate for that matter.,And we're rubbing our eyes,nchecking the filters,,thinking that somebody's maybenplaying a joke on us with the camera,,but the eel was real. 
 It was the first greennfluorescent eel that we found,,and this just changednmy trajectory completely.,So I had to put down my corals and team up,with a fish scientist, John Sparks,,and begin a search around the world,to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.,And fish are much moreninteresting than corals,,because they have really advanced vision,,and some of the fish even have,nthe way that I was photographing it,,they have lenses in their eyesnthat would magnify the fluorescence.,So I wanted to seek this out further. 
 So we designed a new set of gear,and we're scouring the reefsnaround the world,,looking for fluorescent life.,And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home.",We're out there swimmingnwith this blue light,,and we're looking for a response,,for animals to be absorbing the lightnand transferring this back to us.,And eventually, we foundnour photobombing Kaupichphys eel.,It's a really shy, reclusive eelnthat we know almost nothing about.,They're only about the size of my finger,,and they spend about 99.9 percentnof their time hidden under a rock.,But these eels do come out to matenunder full-moon nights,,and that full-moon nightntranslates underwater to blue.,Perhaps they're using thisnas a way to see each other,,quickly find each other, mate,,go back into their holenfor the next long stint of time.,But then we started to findnother fluorescent marine life,,like this green fluorescent bream,,with its, like, racing stripesnalong its head and its nape,,and it's almost camouflagednand fluorescing at the same intensity,as the fluorescent coral there. 
 After this fish,,we were introduced to this rednfluorescent scorpionfish,cloaked and hidden on this rock.,The only time we've ever seen this,nit's either on red fluorescent algae,or red fluorescent coral. 
 Later, we found this stealthyngreen fluorescent lizardfish.,These lizardfish come in many varieties,,and they look almost exactly alikenunder white light.,But if you look at themnunder fluorescent light,,you see lots of patterns,,you can really seenthe differences among them.,And in total -- we just reportednthis last year --,we found over 200 speciesnof biofluorescent fish. 
 One of my inspirations is French artistnand biologist Jean Painlevé.,He really captures this entrepreneuring,ncreative spirit in biology.,He would design his own gear,nmake his own cameras,,and he was fascinated with the seahorse,nHippocampus erectus,,and he filmed for the first timenthe seahorse giving birth.,So this is the male seahorse.,They were one of the first fishnto start swimming upright,with their brain above their head.,The males give birth,,just phenomenal creatures.,So he stayed awake for days.,He even put this electrical visornon his head that would shock him,,so he could capture this moment.,Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé,the moment where we foundnbiofluorescent seahorses,in the exact same speciesnthat he was studying.,And here's our footage. 
 (Music) 
 They're the most cryptic fish.,You could be swimming right on top of themnand not see the seahorse.,They would blend right into the algae,nwhich would also fluoresce red,,but they've got great vision,,and they go throughnthis long mating ritual,,and perhaps they're using itnin that effect. 
 But things got pretty edgy,when we found greennfluorescence in the stingray,,because stingrays arenin the Elasmobranch class,,which includes ...,sharks.,So I'm, like, a coral biologist.,Somebody's got to go down and checknto see if the sharks are fluorescent.,And there I am. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was like, "Maybe I shouldngo back to corals." 
 (Laughter) 
 It turns out that these sharksnare not fluorescent.,And then we found it.,In a deep, dark canyonnoff the coast of California,,we found the firstnbiofluorescent swellshark,,right underneath all the surfers.,Here it is.,They're just about a meter long.nIt's called a swellshark.,And they call them a swellsharknbecause if they're threatened,,they can gulp down waternand blow up like an inner tube,,about twice their size,,and wedge themselves under a rock,nso they don't get eaten by a predator.,And here is our first footagenof these biofluorescent swellsharks.,Just magnificent -- I mean,nthey're showing these distinct patterns,,and there are areas that are fluorescentnand areas that are not fluorescent,,but they've also got thesentwinkling spots on them,that are much brighternthan other parts of the shark. 
 But this is all beautiful to see.,I was like, this is gorgeous.,But what does it mean to the shark?,Can they see this?,And we looked in the literature,,and nothing was knownnabout this shark's vision.,So I took this shark to eye specialistnEllis Loew at Cornell University,,and we found out that this sharknsees discretely and acutely,in the blue-green interface,,probably about 100 times betternthan we can see in the dark,,but they only see blue-green.,So what it's doingnis taking this blue world,and it's absorbing the blue,ncreating green.,It's creating contrastnthat they can indeed see.,So we have a model,,showing that it creates an abilitynfor them to see all these patterns.,And males and femalesnalso have, we're finding,,distinct patterns among them. 
 But our last find came really justna few miles from where we are now,,in the Solomon Islands.,Swimming at night, I encounterednthe first biofluorescent sea turtle.,So now it's going from fishnand sharks into reptiles,,which, again, this is only one month old,,but it shows usnthat we know almost nothing,about this hawksbill turtle's vision.,And it makes me think aboutnhow much more there is to learn.,And here in the Solomon Islands,,there's only a few thousandnbreeding females of this species left,,and this is one of the hotspots for them.,So it shows us how much we neednto really protect these animals,while they're still here,nand understand them. 
 In thinking about biofluorescence,,I wanted to know, how deep does it go?,Does this go all the waynto the bottom of the ocean?,So we started using submarines,nand we equipped them,with special blue lightsnon the front here.,And we dropped down,,and we noticed one important thing --,that as we get down to 1,000 meters,,it drops off.,There's no biofluorescent marine lifendown there, below 1,000 meters --,almost nothing, it's just darkness.,So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.,And below 1,000 meters,,we encountered the bioluminescent zone,,where nine out of 10 animalsnare actually making their own lights,and flashing and blinking. 
 As I try to get deeper,,this is slapping on a one-personnsubmarine suit --,some people call this my "Jacques Cousteaunmeets Woody Allen" moment. 
 (Laughter) 
 But as we explore down here,,I was thinking about: How do weninteract with life delicately?,Because we're enteringna new age of exploration,,where we have to take great care,,and we have to set examplesnhow we explore.,So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Woodnat Harvard University,,and we've been designingnsquishy underwater robot fingers,,so we can delicately interactnwith the marine life down there.,The idea is that most of our technologiesnto explore the deep ocean,come from oil and gas and military,,who, you know, they're not reallyncaring to be gentle.,Some corals could be 1,000 years old.,You don't want to just gonand crush them with a big claw.,So my dream is something like this.,At night, I'm in a submarine,,I have force-feedback gloves,,and I could delicately set upna lab in the front of my submarine,,where the squishy robot fingers,are delicately collectingnand putting things in jars,,and we can conduct our research. 
 Back to the powerful applied applications.,Here, you're looking at a living brain,that's using the DNAnof fluorescent marine creatures,,this one from jellyfish and corals,,to illuminate the living brainnand see its connections.,It's funny that we're using RGB,just to kind of satisfynour own human intuition,,so we can see our brains better.,And even more mind-blowing,,is my close colleaguenVincent Pieribone at Yale,,who has actually designed and engineeredna fluorescent protein,that responds to voltage.,So he could seenwhen a single neuron fires.,You're essentially looking atna portal into consciousness,that was designed by marine creatures. 
 So this brings me all backnto perspective and relationship.,From deep space,,our universe looksnlike a human brain cell,,and then here we are in the deep ocean,,and we're findingnmarine creatures and cells,that can illuminate the human mind.,And it's my hopenthat with illuminated minds,,we could ponder the overarchingninterconnectedness of all life,,and fathom how much more lies in store,if we keep our oceans healthy. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ten years ago,,I had my first exhibition here.,I had no idea if it would worknor was at all possible,,but with a few small stepsnand a very steep learning curve,,I made my first sculpture,ncalled "The Lost Correspondent.",Teaming up with a marine biologistnand a local dive center,,I submerged the worknoff the coast of Grenada,,in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.,And then this incredible thing happened.,It transformed.,One sculpture became two.,Two quickly became 26.,And before I knew it,,we had the world's firstnunderwater sculpture park. 
 In 2009, I moved to Mexiconand started by casting local fisherman.,This grew to a small community,,to almost an entire movement of peoplenin defense of the sea.,And then finally, to an underwater museum,,with over 500 living sculptures.,Gardening, it seems,nis not just for greenhouses.,We've since scaled up the designs:,"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas,nrising 16 feet up to the surface,and weighing over 40 tons,,to now currently in Lanzarote,,where I'm makingnan underwater botanical garden,,the first of its kindnin the Atlantic Ocean. 
 Each project, we use materialsnand designs that help encourage life;,a long-lasting pH-neutral cementnprovides a stable and permanent platform.,It is textured to allowncoral polyps to attach.,We position them down currentnfrom natural reefs,so that after spawning,nthere's areas for them to settle.,The formations are all configurednso that they aggregate fish,on a really large scale.,Even this VW Beetlenhas an internal living habitat,to encourage crustaceansnsuch as lobsters and sea urchins. 
 So why exhibit my work in the ocean?,Because honestly, it's really not easy.,When you're in the middle of the seanunder a hundred-foot crane,,trying to lower eight tonsndown to the sea floor,,you start to wonder whether I shouldn'tnhave taken up watercolor painting instead. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in the end, the resultsnalways blow my mind. 
 (Music) 
 The ocean is the mostnincredible exhibition space,an artist could ever wish for.,You have amazing lighting effectsnchanging by the hour,,explosions of sand coveringnthe sculptures in a cloud of mystery,,a unique timeless quality,and the processionnof inquisitive visitors,,each lending their ownnspecial touch to the site. 
 (Music) 
 But over the years,,I've realized that the greatestnthing about what we do,,the really humbling thing about the work,,is that as soon as wensubmerge the sculptures,,they're not ours anymore,,because as soon as we sink them,,the sculptures, they belong to the sea.,As new reefs form, a new worldnliterally starts to evolve,,a world that continuously amazes me.,It's a bit of a cliché,nbut nothing man-made,can ever match the imagination of nature. 
 Sponges look like veins across the faces.,Staghorn coral morphs the form.,Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.,Tunicates explode from the faces.,Sea urchins crawl acrossnthe bodies feeding at night.,Coralline algae appliesna kind of purple paint.,The deepest red I've ever seennin my life lives underwater.,Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.,Purple sponges breathe water like air.,And grey angelfishnglide silently overhead. 
 And the amazing responsenwe've had to these works,tells me that we've managednto plug into something really primal,,because it seems that these imagesntranslate across the world,,and that's made me focusnon my responsibility as an artist,and about what I'm trying to achieve.,I'm standing here today on this boatnin the middle of the ocean,,and this couldn't be a better place,to talk about the really,nreally important effect of my work.,Because as we all know,,our reefs are dying,nand our oceans are in trouble. 
 So here's the thing:,the most used, searched and shared image,of all my work thus far is this.,And I think this is for a reason,,or at least I hope it is.,What I really hope is that peoplenare beginning to understand,that when we think of the environmentnand the destruction of nature,,that we need to start thinkingnabout our oceans, too. 
 Since building these sites,nwe've seen some phenomenal,and unexpected results.,Besides creating over 800 square metersnof new habitats and living reef,,visitors to the marine park in Cancunnnow divide half their time,between the museum and the natural reefs,,providing significant restnfor natural, overstressed areas.,Visitors to "Ocean Atlas"nin the Bahamas highlighted a leak,from a nearby oil refinery.,The subsequent international medianforced the local government,to pledge 10 million dollarsnin coastal cleanups.,The sculpture park in Grenadanwas instrumental,in the government designating a spot --na marine-protected area.,Entrance fees to the parknnow help fund park rangers,to manage tourism and fishing quotas.,The site was actually listednas a "Wonder of the World",by National Geographic. 
 So why are we all here today in this room?,What do we all have in common?,I think we all share a fear,that we don't protect our oceans enough.,And one way of thinking about this,is that we don't regardnour oceans as sacred,,and we should.,When we see incredible places --,like the Himalayasnor the La Sagrada Família,,or the Mona Lisa, even --,when we see these incrediblenplaces and things,,we understand their importance.,We call them sacred,,and we do our bestnto cherish them, to protect them,and to keep them safe.,But in order to do that,,we are the ones that havento assign that value;,otherwise, it will be desecrated,by someone who doesn'tnunderstand that value. 
 So I want to finish up tonightnby talking about sacred things.,When we were naming the site in Cancun,,we named it a museum for a verynimportant and simple reason:,museums are places of preservation,,of conservation and of education.,They're places where we keepnobjects of great value to us,,where we simply treasure themnfor them being themselves.,If someone was to thrownan egg at the Sistine Chapel,,we'd all go crazy.,If someone wantednto build a seven-star hotel,at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,,then we would laugh them out of Arizona.,Yet every day we dredge, pollutenand overfish our oceans.,And I think it's easier for us to do that,,because when we see the ocean,,we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.,Because for most people,,the ocean is like this.,And it's really hard,to think of something that's justnso plain and so enormous, as fragile.,It's simply too massive,ntoo vast, too endless.,And what do you see here?,I think most people actuallynlook past to the horizon.,So I think there's a real danger,that we never really see the sea,,and if we don't really see it,,if it doesn't have its own iconography,,if we miss its majesty,,then there's a big dangernthat we take it for granted. 
 Cancun is famous for spring break,,tequila and foam parties.,And its waters are where frat boysncan ride around on Jet Skis,and banana boats.,But because of our work there,nthere's now a little corner of Cancun,that is simply precious for being itself.,And we don't want to stop in Grenada,,in Cancun or the Bahamas.,Just last month, I installednthese Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,in the Thames River,,in central London, right in frontnof the Houses of Parliament,,putting a stark messagenabout climate change,in front of the people that haventhe power to help change things. 
 Because for me, this is justnthe beginning of the mission.,We want to team up with other inventors,,creators, philanthropists,neducators, biologists,,to see better futures for our oceans.,And we want to see beyond sculpture,,beyond art, even. 
 Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,,and you've never seen the ocean.,And instead of getting takennto the natural history museum,or an aquarium,,you get taken out to the ocean,,to an underwater Noah's Ark,,which you can accessnthrough a dry-glass viewing tunnel,,where you can seenall the wildlife of the land,be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.,Clearly, it would blow your mind. 
 So let's think big and let's think deep.,Who knows where our imaginationnand willpower can lead us?,I hope that by bringingnour art into the ocean,,that not only do we take advantagenof amazing creativity,and visual impact of the setting,,but that we are alsongiving something back,,and by encouragingnnew environments to thrive,,and in some way opening up a new --nor maybe it's a really old way,of seeing the seas:,as delicate, precious places,,worthy of our protection. 
 Our oceans are sacred. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What was the mostndifficult job you ever did?,Was it working in the sun?,Was it working to provide foodnfor a family or a community?,Was it working days and nightsntrying to protect lives and property?,Was it working alone,or working on a projectnthat wasn't guaranteed to succeed,,but that might improvenhuman health or save a life?,Was it working to build something,ncreate something, make a work of art?,Was it work for which you were never sure,you were fully understood or appreciated?,The people in our communitiesnwho do these jobs,deserve our attention, our lovenand our deepest support. 
 But people aren't the only onesnin our communities,who do these difficult jobs.,These jobs are also donenby the plants, the animals,and the ecosystems on our planet,,including the ecosystems I study:nthe tropical coral reefs.,Coral reefs are farmers.,They provide food, incomenand food security,for hundreds of millionsnof people around the world.,Coral reefs are security guards.,The structures that they buildnprotect our shorelines,from storm surge and waves,,and the biological systemsnthat they house filter the water,and make it safer for us to work and play.,Coral reefs are chemists.,The molecules that we're discoveringnon coral reefs are increasingly important,in the search for new antibioticsnand new cancer drugs.,And coral reefs are artists.,The structures that they build,are some of the mostnbeautiful things on planet Earth.,And this beauty is the foundationnof the tourism industry,in many countries with fewnor little other natural resources. 
 So for all of these reasons,nall of these ecosystem services,,economists estimate the valuenof the world's coral reefs,in the hundreds of billionsnof dollars per year.,And yet despite all that hard worknbeing done for us,and all that wealth that we gain,,we have done almost everythingnwe possibly could to destroy that.,We have taken the fish out of the oceans,and we have added in fertilizer, sewage,,diseases, oil, pollution, sediments.,We have trampled the reefs physicallynwith our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,,and we have changed the chemistrynof the entire sea,,warmed the waters and made storms worse.,And these would all be bad on their own,,but these threats magnify each other,and compound one anothernand make each other worse. 
 I'll give you an example.,Where I live and work, in Curaçao,na tropical storm went by a few years ago.,And on the eastern end of the island,,where the reefs are intact and thriving,,you could barely tellna tropical storm had passed.,But in town, where corals had diednfrom overfishing, from pollution,,the tropical storm picked upnthe dead corals,and used them as bludgeonsnto kill the corals that were left.,This is a coral that I studiednduring my PhD --,I got to know it quite well.,And after this stormntook off half of its tissue,,it became infested with algae,,the algae overgrew the tissuenand that coral died.,This magnification of threats,nthis compounding of factors,is what Jeremy Jackson describesnas the "slippery slope to slime.",It's hardly even a metaphornbecause many of our reefs now,are literally bacterianand algae and slime. 
 Now, this is the part of the talk,where you may expect mento launch into my plea,for us to all save the coral reefs.,But I have a confession to make:,that phrase drives me nuts.,Whether I see it in a tweet,nin a news headline,or the glossy pagesnof a conservation brochure,,that phrase bothers me,,because we as conservationistsnhave been sounding the alarms,about the deathnof coral reefs for decades.,And yet, almost everyone I meet,nno matter how educated,,is not sure what a coral isnor where they come from.,How would we get someone to carenabout the world's coral reefs,when it's an abstract thingnthey can barely understand?,If they don't understandnwhat a coral is or where it comes from,,or how funny or interestingnor beautiful it is,,why would we expect themnto care about saving them? 
 So let's change that.,What is a coralnand where does it come from?,Corals are bornnin a number of different ways,,but most often by mass spawning:nall of the individuals of a single species,on one night a year,,releasing all the eggsnthey've made that year,into the water column,,packaged into bundles with sperm cells.,And those bundles go to the surfacenof the ocean and break apart.,And hopefully -- hopefully --nat the surface of the ocean,,they meet the eggs and spermnfrom other corals.,And that is why you neednlots of corals on a coral reef --,so that all of their eggs cannmeet their match at the surface.,When they're fertilized, they donwhat any other animal egg does:,divides in half again and again and again.,Taking these photosnunder the microscope every year,is one of my favorite and mostnmagical moments of the year.,At the end of all this cell division,nthey turn into a swimming larva --,a little tiny blob of fatnthe size of a poppy seed,,but with all of the sensorynsystems that we have.,They can sense color and light,ntextures, chemicals, pH.,They can even feel pressure waves;nthey can hear sound.,And they use those talents,to search the bottom of the reefnfor a place to attach,and live the rest of their lives. 
 So imagine finding a placenwhere you would live the rest of your life,when you were just two days old.,They attach in the placenthey find most suitable,,they build a skeletonnunderneath themselves,,they build a mouth and tentacles,,and then they begin the difficult worknof building the world's coral reefs.,One coral polyp will divide itselfnagain and again and again,,leaving a limestone skeletonnunderneath itself,and growing up toward the sun.,Given hundreds of years and many species,,what you get is a massivenlimestone structure,that can be seen from space in many cases,,covered by a thin skinnof these hardworking animals.,Now, there are only a few hundred speciesnof corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.,But these systems house millionsnand millions of other species,,and that diversity is whatnstabilizes the systems,,and it's where we're findingnour new medicines.,It's how we find new sources of food.,I'm lucky enough to worknon the island of Curaçao,,where we still have reefsnthat look like this.,But, indeed, much of the Caribbeannand much of our world,is much more like this. 
 Scientists have studiednin increasing detail,the loss of the world's coral reefs,,and they have documentednwith increasing certainty the causes.,But in my research, I'm notninterested in looking backward.,My colleagues and I in Curaçaonare interested in looking forward,at what might be.,And we have the tiniest reasonnto be optimistic.,Because even in some of these reefs,that we probably could havenwritten off long ago,,we sometimes see baby coralsnarrive and survive anyway.,And we're starting to thinknthat baby corals may have the ability,to adjust to some of the conditionsnthat the adults couldn't.,They may be able to adjust,ever so slightly more readilynto this human planet.,So in the research I donwith my colleagues in Curaçao,,we try to figure outnwhat a baby coral needs,in that critical early stage,,what it's looking for,and how we can try to help itnthrough that process.,I'm going to show you three examplesnof the work we've done,to try to answer those questions. 
 A few years ago we took a 3D printernand we made coral choice surveys --,different colors and different textures,,and we simply asked the coralnwhere they preferred to settle.,And we found that corals,neven without the biology involved,,still prefer white and pink,nthe colors of a healthy reef.,And they prefer crevicesnand grooves and holes,,where they will be safenfrom being trampled,or eaten by a predator.,So we can use this knowledge,,we can go back and saynwe need to restore those factors --,that pink, that white, those crevices,nthose hard surfaces --,in our conservation projects.,We can also use that knowledge,if we're going to put somethingnunderwater, like a sea wall or a pier.,We can choose to use the materialsnand colors and textures,that might bias the systemnback toward those corals.,Now in addition to the surfaces,,we also study the chemicalnand microbial signals,that attract corals to reefs.,Starting about six years ago,nI began culturing bacteria,from surfaces where corals had settled.,And I tried those one by one by one,,looking for the bacteria that wouldnconvince corals to settle and attach.,And we now have manynbacterial strains in our freezer,that will reliably cause corals,to go through that settlementnand attachment process.,So as we speak,,my colleagues in Curaçaonare testing those bacteria,to see if they'll help us raisenmore coral settlers in the lab,,and to see if those coral settlersnwill survive better,when we put them back underwater. 
 Now in addition to these tools,nwe also try to uncover the mysteries,of species that are under-studied.,This is one of my favorite corals,nand always has been:,dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.,I love it because it makesnthis ridiculous shape,,because its tentaclesnare fat and look fuzzy,and because it's rare.,Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.,In fact, it's so rare,,that last year it was listednas a threatened species,on the endangered species list.,And this was in part becausenin over 30 years of research surveys,,scientists had never foundna baby pillar coral.,We weren't even surenif they could still reproduce,,or if they were still reproducing. 
 So four years ago, we startednfollowing these at night,and watching to see if we couldnfigure out when they spawn in Curaçao.,We got some good tipsnfrom our colleagues in Florida,,who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,,and eventually we figured outnwhen they spawn in Curaçao,and we caught it.,Here's a female on the leftnwith some eggs in her tissue,,about to release them into the seawater.,And here's a malenon the right, releasing sperm.,We collected this, we got itnback to the lab, we got it to fertilize,and we got baby pillar coralsnswimming in our lab.,Thanks to the worknof our scientific aunts and uncles,,and thanks to the 10 years of practicenwe've had in Curaçao,at raising other coral species,,we got some of those larvaento go through the rest of the process,and settle and attach,,and turn into metamorphosed corals.,So this is the first pillar coral babynthat anyone ever saw. 
 (Applause) 
 And I have to say --nif you think baby pandas are cute,,this is cuter. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we're starting to figure outnthe secrets to this process,,the secrets of coral reproductionnand how we might help them.,And this is true all around the world;,scientists are figuring out new waysnto handle their embryos,,to get them to settle,,maybe even figuring out the methodsnto preserve them at low temperatures,,so that we can preserventheir genetic diversity,and work with them more often.,But this is still so low-tech.,We are limited by the space on our bench,nthe number of hands in the lab,and the number of coffeesnwe can drink in any given hour. 
 Now, compare that to our other crises,and our other areasnof concern as a society.,We have advanced medical technology,nwe have defense technology,,we have scientific technology,,we even have advanced technology for art.,But our technologynfor conservation is behind.,Think back to the mostndifficult job you ever did.,Many of you would saynit was being a parent.,My mother described being a parent,as something that makes your lifenfar more amazing and far more difficult,than you could've ever possibly imagined.,I've been trying to help coralsnbecome parents for over 10 years now.,And watching the wonder of life,has certainly filled me with amazementnto the core of my soul.,But I've also seen how difficultnit is for them to become parents.,The pillar corals spawnednagain two weeks ago,,and we collected their eggsnand brought them back to the lab.,And here you see one embryo dividing,,alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize,and will blow up.,They'll be infected with bacteria,nthey will explode,and those bacteria will threatennthe life of this one embryo,that has a chance.,We don't know if it was our handlingnmethods that went wrong,and we don't know,if it was just this coral on this reef,nalways suffering from low fertility.,Whatever the cause,,we have much more work to donbefore we can use baby corals,to grow or fix or, yes,nmaybe save coral reefs. 
 So never mind that they're worthnhundreds of billions of dollars.,Coral reefs are hardworking animalsnand plants and microbes and fungi.,They're providing us with artnand food and medicine.,And we almost took outnan entire generation of corals.,But a few made it anyway,ndespite our best efforts,,and now it's time for us to thank themnfor the work they did,and give them every chance they havento raise the coral reefs of the future,,their coral babies. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)So I come from the tallestnpeople on the planet --,the Dutch.,It hasn't always been this way.,In fact, all across the globe,npeople have been gaining height.,In the last 150 years,,in developed countries,,on average, we have gottenn10 centimeters taller.,And scientists have a lotnof theories about why this is,,but almost all of them involve nutrition,,namely the increase of dairy and meat. 
 In the last 50 years,,global meat consumptionnhas more than quadrupled,,from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.,Something similar has been going onnwith milk and eggs.,In every society where incomes have risen,nso has protein consumption.,And we know that globally,nwe are getting richer.,And as the middle class is on the rise,nso is our global population,,from 7 billion of us todaynto 9.7 billion by 2050,,which means that by 2050,,we are going to need at leastn70 percent more protein,than what is available to humankind today.,And the latest prediction of the UNnputs that population number,,by the end of this century, at 11 billion,,which means that we are goingnto need a lot more protein. 
 This challenge is staggering --,so much so, that recently,,a team at Anglia RuskinnGlobal Sustainability Institute suggested,that if we don't changenour global policies,and food production systems,,our societies might actually collapsenin the next 30 years. 
 Currently, our ocean servesnas the main source of animal protein.,Over 2.6 billion peoplendepend on it every single day.,At the same time,,our global fisheriesnare two-and-a-half times larger,than what our oceansncan sustainably support,,meaning that humans takenfar more fish from the ocean,than the oceans can naturally replace. 
 WWF recently published a reportnshowing that just in the last 40 years,,our global marine lifenhas been slashed in half.,And another recent report suggestsnthat of our largest predatory species,,such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,,over 90 percent has disappearednsince the 1950s. 
 And there are a lot of great, sustainablenfishing initiatives across the planet,working towards better practicesnand better-managed fisheries.,But ultimately,,all of these initiatives are workingntowards keeping current catch constant.,It's unlikely,,even with the best-managed fisheries,,that we are going to be able to takenmuch more from the ocean,than we do today. 
 We have to stop plunderingnour oceans the way we have.,We need to alleviate the pressure on it.,And we are at a point,where if we push much hardernfor more produce,,we might face total collapse.,Our current systems are not going to feedna growing global population. 
 So how do we fix this?,What's the world going to look likenin just 35 short years,when there's 2.7 billion more of usnsharing the same resources?,We could all become vegan.,Sounds like a great idea,,but it's not realistic,and it's impossibly hardnto mandate globally. 
 People are eating animal proteinnwhether we like it or not.,And suppose we fail to change our ways,and continue on the current path,,failing to meet demands. 
 The World Health Organizationnrecently reported,that 800 million people are sufferingnfrom malnutrition and food shortage,,which is due to that samengrowing, global population,and the declining access to resourcesnlike water, energy and land.,It takes very little imagination,to picture a world of global unrest,nriots and further malnutrition.,People are hungry,,and we are running dangerously lownon natural resources.,For so, so many reasons,,we need to change our globalnfood production systems. 
 We must do better,and there is a solution.,And that solution lies in aquaculture --,the farming of fish, plants like seaweed,nshellfish and crustaceans.,As the great ocean heronJacques Cousteau once said,,"We must start using the oceannas farmers instead of hunters.,That's what civilization is all about --nfarming instead of hunting.",Fish is the last food that we hunt. 
 And why is it that we keepnhearing phrases like,,"Life's too short for farmed fish,",or, "Wild-caught, of course!",over fish that we knownvirtually nothing about?,We don't know what it atenduring its lifetime,,and we don't know whatnpollution it encounters.,And if it was a large predatory species,,it might have gone through the coastnof Fukushima yesterday.,We don't know.,Very few people realize,the traceability in fisheriesnnever goes beyond the hunter,that caught the wild animal. 
 But let's back up for a second,and talk about why fishnis the best food choice.,It's healthy,,it prevents heart disease,,it provides key amino acids,and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,,which is very different from almostnany other type of meat.,And aside from being healthy,,it's also a lot more exciting and diverse. 
 Think about it -- most animal farmingnis pretty monotonous.,Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,,and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --npretty much sums it up.,And then there's 500 species of fishnbeing farmed currently.,not that Western supermarketsnreflect that on their shelves,,but that's beside that point. 
 And you can farm fishnin a very healthy manner,that's good for us, good for the planetnand good for the fish.,I know I sound fish-obsessed -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me explain:,My brilliant partner and wife,nAmy Novograntz, and I got involved,in aquaculture a couple of years ago.,We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,,who won the TED Prize in 2009.,We actually met on Mission Blue Inin the Galapagos.,Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;,me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlandsnand concerned citizen,,love to dive, passion for the oceans. 
 Mission Blue truly changed our lives.,We fell in love,,got married,and we came away really inspired,,thinking we really want to do somethingnabout ocean conservation --,something that was meant to last,,that could make a real difference,and something that we could do together. 
 Little did we expect that that wouldnlead us to fish farming.,But a few months afternwe got off the boat,,we got to a meetingnat Conservation International,,where the Director General of WorldFishnwas talking about aquaculture,,asking a room full of environmentalistsnto stop turning from it,,realize what was going on,and to really get involved,because aquaculture has the potential,to be just what our oceansnand populations need. 
 We were stunned when we heard the stats,that we didn't know morenabout this industry already,and excited about the chancento help get it right. 
 And to talk about stats --,right now, the amount of fishnconsumed globally,,wild catch and farmed combined,,is twice the tonnagenof the total amount of beef,produced on planet earth last year.,Every single fishing vessel combined,,small and large, across the globe,,together produce about 65 million tonsnof wild-caught seafood,for human consumption. 
 Aquaculture this year,,for the first time in history,,actually produces morenthan what we catch from the wild. 
 But now this:,Demand is going to go up.,In the next 35 years,,we are going to need an additionaln85 million tons to meet demand,,which is one-and-a-half timesnas much, almost,,as what we catch globallynout of our oceans.,An enormous number. 
 It's safe to assume that that's notngoing to come from the ocean.,It needs to come from farming.,And talk about farming --,for farming you need resources.,As a human needs to eatnto grow and stay alive,,so does an animal.,A cow needs to eatneight to nine pounds of feed,and drink almost 8,000 liters of water,to create just one pound of meat.,Experts agree that it's impossible,to farm cows for everyninhabitant on this planet.,We just don't have enough feed or water. 
 And we can't keep cutting downnrain forests for it.,And fresh water -- planet earthnhas a very limited supply.,We need something more efficient,to keep humankind alive on this planet. 
 And now let's comparenthat with fish farming.,You can farm one pound of fishnwith just one pound of feed,,and depending on species, even less.,And why is that?,Well, that's because fish,nfirst of all, float.,They don't need to stand around all daynresisting gravity like we do.,And most fish are cold-blooded --,they don't need to heat themselves.,Fish chills. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it needs very little water,,which is counterintuitive,,but as we say,,it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.,Fish are the most resource-efficientnanimal protein available to humankind,,aside from insects. 
 How much we've learned since.,For example, on top of thatn65 million tons that's annually caught,for human consumption,,there's an additional 30 million tonsncaught for animal feed,,mostly sardines and anchoviesnfor the aquaculture industry,that's turned into fish meal and fish oil. 
 This is madness.,Sixty-five percent of these fisheries,nglobally, are badly managed.,Some of the worst issuesnof our time are connected to it.,It's destroying our oceans.,The worst slavery issuesnimaginable are connected to it.,Recently, an article came out of Stanford,saying that if 50 percentnof the world's aquaculture industry,would stop using fish meal,,our oceans would be saved.,Now think about that for a minute. 
 Now, we know that the oceansnhave far more problems --,they have pollution,nthere's acidification,,coral reef destruction and so on.,But it underlines the impactnof our fisheries,,and it underlines howninterconnected everything is.,Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,,climate change, food security and so on. 
 In the search for alternatives,,the industry, on a massive scale,,has reverted to plant-based alternatives,like soy, industrial chicken waste,,blood meal from slaughterhouses,and so on. 
 And we understand wherenthese choices come from,,but this is not the right approach.,It's not sustainable,,it's not healthy.,Have you ever seen a chickennat the bottom of the ocean?,Of course not.,If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,,it literally explodes.,Salmon is a carnivore,,it has no way to digest soy. 
 Now, fish farming is by far,the best animal farmingnavailable to humankind.,But it's had a really bad reputation.,There's been excessive use of chemicals,,there's been virus and diseasentransfered to wild populations,,ecosystem destruction and pollution,,escaped fish breedingnwith wild populations,,altering the overall genetic pool,,and then of course, as just mentioned,,the unsustainable feed ingredients. 
 How blessed were the days,when we could just enjoynfood that was on our plate,,whatever it was.,Once you know, you know.,You can't go back.,It's not fun.,We really need a transparent foodnsystem that we can trust,,that produces healthy food. 
 But the good news is,that decades of development and research,have led to a lot of newntechnologies and knowledge,that allow us to do a lot better.,We can now farm fishnwithout any of these issues. 
 I think of agriculturenbefore the green revolution --,we are at aquaculturenand the blue revolution.,New technologies means,that we can now produce a feednthat's perfectly natural,,with a minimal footprint,that consists of microbes, insects,nseaweeds and micro-algae.,Healthy for the people,,healthy for the fish,,healthy for the planet. 
 Microbes, for example,,can be a perfect alternativenfor high-grade fish meal --,at scale. 
 Insects are the --,well, first of all, the perfect recycling,because they're grown on food waste;,but second,,think of fly-fishing,,and you know how logicalnit actually is to use it as fish feed.,You don't need large tracts of land for it,and you don't neednto cut down rain forests for it.,And microbes and insects are actuallynnet water producers. 
 This revolution is starting as we speak,,it just needs scale.,We can now farm far morenspecies than ever before,in controlled, natural conditions,ncreating happy fish. 
 I imagine, for example,,a closed system that's performingnmore efficiently than insect farming,,where you can producenhealthy, happy, delicious fish,with little or no effluent,,almost no energy and almost no water,and a natural feednwith a minimal footprint.,Or a system where you grownup to 10 species next to each other --,off of each other,,mimicking nature.,You need very little feed,,very little footprint.,I think of seaweed growingnoff the effluent of fish, for example. 
 There's great technologiesnpopping up all over the globe.,From alternatives to battle disease,so we don't need antibioticsnand chemicals anymore,,to automated feeders that feelnwhen the fish are hungry,,so we can save on feednand create less pollution.,Software systems that gatherndata across farms,,so we can improve farm practices. 
 There's really cool stuffnhappening all over the globe.,And make no mistake --nall of these things are possible,at a cost that's competitivento what a farmer spends today.,Tomorrow, there will be no excusenfor anyone to not do the right thing. 
 So somebody needs to connect the dots,and give these developmentsna big kick in the butt.,And that's what we've been working onnthe last couple of years,,and that's what we neednto be working on together --,rethinking everything from the ground up,,with a holistic viewnacross the value chain,,connecting all these thingsnacross the globe,,alongside great entrepreneurs,that are willing to sharena collective vision. 
 Now is the time to createnchange in this industry,and to push it intona sustainable direction.,This industry is still young,,much of its growth is still ahead.,It's a big task, but notnas far-fetched as you might think.,It's possible. 
 So we need to take pressure off the ocean.,We want to eat good and healthy.,And if we eat an animal,nit needs to be one,that had a happy and healthy life. 
 We need to have a meal that we can trust,,live long lives.,And this is not just for peoplenin San Francisco or Northern Europe --,this is for all of us.,Even in the poorest countries,,it's not just about money.,People prefer something freshnand healthy that they can trust,over something that comes from far awaynthat they know nothing about.,We're all the same. 
 The day will come,where people will realize -- no, demand --nfarmed fish on their plate,that's farmed wellnand that's farmed healthy --,and refuse anything less. 
 You can help speed this up.,Ask questions when you order seafood.,Where does my fish come from?,Who raised it,,and what did it eat?,Information about where your fishncomes from and how it was produced,needs to be much more readily available.,And consumers need to put pressurenon the aquaculture industry,to do the right thing. 
 So every time you order,,ask for detail,and show that you really carenabout what you eat,and what's been given to you.,And eventually, they will listen.,And all of us will benefit. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So when I was a kid ...,this was my team. 
 (Laughter) 
 I stunk at sports.,I didn't like to play them,nI didn't like to watch them.,So this is what I did. I went fishing.,And for all of my growing upnI fished on the shores of Connecticut,,and these are the creaturesnthat I saw on a regular basis.,But after I grew up and went to college,,and I came home in the early 90's,,this is what I found.,My team had shrunk.,It was like literally havingnyour roster devastated.,And as I sort of looked into that,,from a very personalnpoint of view as a fisherman,,I started to kind of figure out,,well, what was the rest of the worldnthinking about it? 
 First place I started to looknwas fish markets.,And when I went to fish markets,,in spite of where I was --,whether I was in North Carolina,nor Paris, or London, or wherever --,I kept seeing this weirdlynrepeating trope of four creatures,,again and again --,on the menus, on ice --,shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.,And I thought this was pretty strange,,and as I looked at it, I was wondering,,did anyone else noticenthis sort of shrinking of the market? 
 Well, when I looked into it,,I realized that peoplendidn't look at it as their team.,Ordinary people, the way they lookednat seafood was like this.,It's not an unusual human characteristic,to reduce the natural worldndown to very few elements.,We did it before, 10,000 years ago,nwhen we came out of our caves.,If you look at fire pitsnfrom 10,000 years ago,,you'll see raccoons,nyou'll see, you know, wolves,,you'll see all kindsnof different creatures.,But if you telescope to the age of --nyou know, 2,000 years ago,,you'll see these four mammals:,pigs, cows, sheep and goats.,It's true of birds, too.,You look at the menusnin New York City restaurants,150 years ago, 200 years ago,,you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse,ndozens of ducks, dozens of geese.,But telescope ahead to the agenof modern animal husbandry,,and you'll see four:,turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese. 
 So it makes sensenthat we've headed in this direction.,But how have we headed in this direction?,Well ...,first it's a very, very new problem.,This is the way we've been fishingnthe oceans over the last 50 years.,World War II was a tremendous incentivento arm ourselves in a war against fish.,All of the technologynthat we perfected during World War II --,sonar, lightweight polymers --,all these thingsnwere redirected towards fish.,And so you see this tremendous buildupnin fishing capacity,,quadrupling in the course of time,,from the end of World War IInto the present time.,And right now that means,we're taking between 80 and 90 millionnmetric tons out of the sea every year.,That's the equivalentnof the human weight of China,taken out of the sea every year.,And it's no coincidencenthat I use China as the example,because China is nownthe largest fishing nation in the world. 
 Well, that's only half the story.,The other half of the story,is this incredible boomnin fish farming and aquaculture,,which is now, onlynin the last year or two,,starting to exceed the amountnof wild fish that we produce.,So that if you add wild fishnand farmed fish together,,you get the equivalentnof two Chinas created from the ocean,each and every year.,And again, it's not a coincidencenthat I use China as the example,,because China, in additionnto being the biggest catcher of fish,,is also the biggest farmer of fish. 
 So let's look though at the four choicesnwe are making right now.,The first one --,by far the most consumed seafoodnin America and in much of the West,,is shrimp.,Shrimp in the wild --nas a wild product --,is a terrible product.,5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fishnare regularly killed,to bring one pound of shrimpnto the market.,They're also incredibly fuel inefficientnto bring to the market.,In a recent study that was producednout of Dalhousie University,,it was found that dragging for shrimp,is one of the most carbon-intensivenways of fishing that you can find. 
 So you can farm them,,and people do farm them,,and they farm them a lotnin this very area.,Problem is ...,the place where you farm shrimpnis in these wild habitats --,in mangrove forests.,Now look at those lovelynroots coming down.,Those are the thingsnthat hold soil together,,protect coasts, create habitatsnfor all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,,all sorts of thingsnthat are important to this environment.,Well, this is what happensnto a lot of coastal mangrove forests.,We've lost millions of acresnof coastal mangroves,over the last 30 or 40 years.,That rate of destruction has slowed,,but we're stillnin a major mangrove deficit. 
 The other thing that's going on here,is a phenomenon that the filmmakernMark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo.",This phenomenon is very, very relevant,to anything that you've ever seennon a tropical reef.,Because what's going on right now,,we have shrimp draggersndragging for shrimp,,catching a huge amount of bycatch,,that bycatch in turn gets ground upnand turned into shrimp food.,And sometimes, many of these vessels --,manned by slaves --,are catching these so-called "trash fish,",fish that we would love to see on a reef,,grinding them up,and turning them into shrimp feed --,an ecosystem literally eating itselfnand spitting out shrimp. 
 The next most consumed seafood in America,,and also throughout the West,,is tuna.,So tuna is this ultimate global fish.,These huge management areasnhave to be observed,in order for tuna to be well managed.,Our own management area,,called a Regional FisheriesnManagement Organization,,is called ICCAT,,the International Commissionnfor the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.,The great naturalistnCarl Safina once called it,,"The International Conspiracynto Catch all the Tunas.",Of course we've seennincredible improvement,in ICCAT in the last few years,,there is total room for improvement,,but it remains to be saidnthat tuna is a global fish,,and to manage it,nwe have to manage the globe. 
 Well, we could also try to grow tuna,but tuna is a spectacularly badnanimal for aquaculture.,Many people don't know thisnbut tuna are warm-blooded.,They can heat their bodies 20 degreesnabove ambient temperature,,they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.,So that pretty much eliminates,all the advantagesnof farming a fish, right?,A farmed fish is --,or a fish is cold-blooded,nit doesn't move too much.,That's a great thing for growing protein.,But if you've gotnthis crazy, wild creature,that swims at 40 miles an hournand heats its blood --,not a great candidate for aquaculture. 
 The next creature --,most consumed seafood in Americanand throughout the West --,is salmon.,Now salmon got its plundering, too,,but it didn't really necessarilynhappen through fishing.,This is my home state of Connecticut.,Connecticut used to be homento a lot of wild salmon.,But if you looknat this map of Connecticut,,every dot on that map is a dam.,There are over 3,000 damsnin the state of Connecticut.,I often say this is why peoplenin Connecticut are so uptight -- 
 (Laughter) 
 If somebody could justnunblock Connecticut's chi,,I feel that we could havenan infinitely better world.,But I made this particular comment,at a convention oncenof national parks officers,,and this guy from North Carolinansidled up to me, he says,,"You know, you oughtn't be so hardnon your Connecticut,,cause we here in North Carolina,nwe got 35,000 dams.",So it's a national epidemic,nit's an international epidemic.,And there are dams everywhere,,and these are precisely the things,that stop wild salmonnfrom reaching their spawning grounds. 
 So as a result,nwe've turned to aquaculture,,and salmon is one the most successful,nat least from a numbers point of view.,When they first started farming salmon,,it could take as manynas six pounds of wild fish,to make a single pound of salmon.,The industry has, to its credit,ngreatly improved.,They've gotten it below two to one,,although it's a little bit of a cheat,because if you look at the waynaquaculture feed is produced,,they're measuring pellets --,pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.,Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.,So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,nthe fish in and the fish out --,kind of hard to say.,But in any case,,credit to the industry,,it has lowered the amount of fishnper pound of salmon. 
 Problem is we've also gone crazy,with the amount of salmonnthat we're producing.,Aquaculture is the fastest growingnfood system on the planet.,It's growing at somethingnlike seven percent per year.,And so even thoughnwe're doing less per fish,to bring it to the market,,we're still killingna lot of these little fish. 
 And it's not just fishnthat we're feeding fish to,,we're also feeding fishnto chickens and pigs.,So we've got chickensnand they're eating fish,,but weirdly, we also have fishnthat are eating chickens.,Because the byproducts of chickens --nfeathers, blood, bone --,get ground up and fed to fish.,So I often wonder,,is there a fish that atena chicken that ate a fish?,It's sort of a reworkingnof the chicken and egg thing. Anyway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 All together, though,nit results in a terrible mess.,What you're talking about,is something between 20 and 30 millionnmetric tons of wild creatures,that are taken from the oceannand used and ground up.,That's the equivalentnof a third of a China,,or of an entire United States of humans,that's taken out of the seaneach and every year. 
 The last of the fournis a kind of amorphous thing.,It's what the industry calls "whitefish.",There are many fish that get cycledninto this whitefish thing,but the way to kind of tellnthe story, I think,,is through that classic piecenof American culinary innovation,,the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.,So the Filet-O-Fish sandwichnactually started as halibut.,And it started becausena local franchise owner,found that when he servednhis McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.,Because it was a Catholicncommunity, they needed fish.,So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,,"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,ngoing to be made out of halibut.",Ray Kroc said, "I don't thinknit's going to work.,I want to do a Hula Burger,,and there's going to bena slice of pineapple on a bun.,But let's do this, let's have a bet.,Whosever sandwich sells more,nthat will be the winning sandwich.",Well, it's kind of sad for the oceannthat the Hula Burger didn't win.,So he made his halibut sandwich.,Unfortunately though,nthe sandwich came in at 30 cents.,Ray wanted the sandwichnto come in at 25 cents,,so he turned to Atlantic cod.,We all know what happened tonAtlantic cod in New England. 
 So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwichnis made out of Alaska pollock,,it's the largest fin fish fisherynin the United States,,2 to 3 billion pounds of fishntaken out of the sea every single year.,If we go through the pollock,,the next choice is probablyngoing to be tilapia.,Tilapia is one of those fishnnobody ever heard of 20 years ago.,It's actually a very efficient converternof plant protein into animal protein,,and it's been a godsendnto the third world.,It's actually a tremendouslynsustainable solution,,it goes from an eggnto an adult in nine months.,The problem is that when younlook about the West,,it doesn't do what the Westnwants it to do.,It really doesn't have what's callednan oily fish profile.,It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s,that we all think are goingnto make us live forever. 
 So what do we do?,I mean, first of all,nwhat about this poor fish, the clupeids?,The fish that represent a huge partnof that 20 to 30 million metric tons.,Well, one possibilitynthat a lot of conservationists have raised,is could we eat them?,Could we eat them directlyninstead of feeding them to salmon?,There are arguments for it.,They are tremendously fuel efficientnto bring to market,,a fraction of the fuel costnof say, shrimp,,and at the very topnof the carbon efficiency scale.,They also are omega-3 rich,na great source for EPA and DHA.,So that is a potential.,And if we were to go down that routenwhat I would say is,,instead of paying a few bucks a pound --nor a few bucks a ton, really --,and making it into aquafeed,,could we halve the catchnand double the price for the fishermen,and make that our waynof treating these particular fish? 
 Other possibility though,nwhich is much more interesting,,is looking at bivalves,nparticularly mussels.,Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA,nthey're similar to canned tuna.,They're also extremely fuel efficient.,To bring a pound of mussels to market,is about a thirtieth of the carbonnas required to bring beef to market.,They require no forage fish,,they actually get their omega-3snby filtering the water of microalgae.,In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,nthey don't come from fish.,Microalgae make the omega-3s,nthey're only bioconcentrated in fish. 
 Mussels and other bivalves,do tremendous amounts of water filtration.,A single mussel can filterndozens of gallons every single day.,And this is incredibly importantnwhen we look at the world.,Right now, nitrification,noveruse of phosphates in our waterways,are causing tremendous algal blooms.,Over 400 new dead zonesnhave been created in the last 20 years,,tremendous sources of marine life death. 
 We also could look at not a fish at all.,We could look at a vegetable.,We could look at seaweed, the kelps,,all these different varieties of thingsnthat can be high in omega-3s,,can be high in proteins,,tremendously good things.,They filter the waternjust like mussels do.,And weirdly enough,,it turns out that youncan actually feed this to cows.,Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.,But if you wanted to keep growing cattle,in a time and placenwhere water resources are limited,,you're growing seaweed in the water,nyou don't have to water it --,major consideration. 
 And the last fish is a question mark.,We have the abilitynto create aquacultured fish,that creates a net gainnof marine protein for us.,This creature would have to be vegetarian,,it would have to be fast growing,,it would have to be adaptablento a changing climate,and it would have to haventhat oily fish profile,,that EPA, DHA, omega-3nfatty acid profile that we're looking for. 
 This exists kind of on paper.,I have been reportingnon these subjects for 15 years.,Every time I do a new story,nsomebody tells me,,"We can do all that. We can do it.nWe've figured it all out.,We can produce a fish,that's a net gain of marine proteinnand has omega-3s.",Great.,It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.,It is time to scale this up.,If we do,,30 million metric tons of seafood,na third of the world catch,,stays in the water. 
 So I guess what I'm saying isnthis is what we've been going with.,We tend to go with our appetitesnrather than our minds.,But if we went with this,nor some configuration of it,,we might have a little more of this. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.,It was this wild placenfull of color and life,,home to these alien-looking,nfantastical creatures.,I pictured big sharksnruling the food chain,and saw graceful sea turtlesndancing across coral reefs. 
 As a marine biologist turned photographer,,I've spent most of my careernlooking for places,as magical as those I usednto dream about when I was little.,As you can see,,I began exploring bodies of waternat a fairly young age.,But the first timenI truly went underwater,,I was about 10 years old.,And I can still vividly remembernfuriously finning,to reach this old, encrustedncannon on a shallow coral reef.,And when I finally managednto grab hold of it,,I looked up, and I was instantlynsurrounded by fish,in all colors of the rainbow.,That was the daynI fell in love with the ocean. 
 Thomas Peschak 
 Conservation Photographer 
 In my 40 years on this planet,,I've had the great privilege to explore,some of its most incredible seascapes,for National Geographic Magazine,and the Save Our Seas Foundation.,I've photographed everythingnfrom really, really big sharks,to dainty ones that fitnin the palm of your hand.,I've smelled the fishy, fishy breathnof humpback whales,feeding just feet away from me,in the cold seas off Canada'snGreat Bear Rainforest.,And I've been privy to the mating ritualsnof green sea turtles,in the Mozambique Channel. 
 Everyone on this planet affectsnand is affected by the ocean.,And the pristine seasnI used to dream of as a child,are becoming harder and harder to find.,They are becoming more compressed,and more threatened.,As we humans continue to maintain our role,as the leading predator on earth,,I've witnessed and photographednmany of these ripple effects firsthand.,For a long time, I thoughtnI had to shock my audience,out of their indifferencenwith disturbing images.,And while this approach has merits,,I have come full circle.,I believe that the best waynfor me to effect change,is to sell love.,I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts,and as a photographer,,I have the rare opportunity,to reveal animals and entire ecosystems,that lie hidden beneathnthe ocean's surface.,You can't love somethingnand become a champion for it,if you don't know it exists.,Uncovering this -- that is the powernof conservation photography. 
 (Music) 
 I've visited hundreds of marine locations,,but there are a handful of seascapes,that have touched me incredibly deeply.,The first time I experiencednthat kind of high,was about 10 years ago,,off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.,And every June and July,,enormous shoals of sardinesntravel northwards,in a mass migrationnwe call the Sardine Run.,And boy, do those fishnhave good reason to run.,In hot pursuit are hoardsnof hungry and agile predators.,Common dolphins hunt together,and they can separate somenof the sardines from the main shoal,and they create bait balls.,They drive and trap the fish upwardnagainst the ocean surface,and then they rush in to dine,on this pulsating and movable feast.,Close behind are sharks.,Now, most people believe,that sharks and dolphinsnare these mortal enemies,,but during the Sardine Run,nthey actually coexist.,In fact, dolphins actuallynhelp sharks feed more effectively.,Without dolphins, the bait ballsnare more dispersed,and sharks often end upnwith what I call a sardine donut,,or a mouth full of water.,Now, while I've had a few spicy momentsnwith sharks on the sardine run,,I know they don't see me as prey.,However, I get bumped and tail-slappednjust like any other guest,at this rowdy, rowdy banquet. 
 From the shores of Africa we travel east,,across the vastnessnthat is the Indian Ocean,to the Maldives, an archipelagonof coral islands.,And during the stormy southwest monsoon,,manta rays from all across the archipelago,travel to a tiny specknin Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.,Armies of crustaceans,,most no bigger than the sizenof your pupils,,are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.,When plankton concentrationsnbecome patchy,,manta rays feed alone,and they somersault themselvesnbackwards again and again,,very much like a puppynchasing its own tail. 
 (Music) 
 However, when plankton densities increase,,the mantas line up head-to-tailnto form these long feeding chains,,and any tasty morsel that escapesnthe first or second manta in line,is surely to be gobbled upnby the next or the one after.,As plankton levels peak in the bay,,the mantas swim closer and closer together,in a unique behaviornwe call cyclone feeding.,And as they swirl in tight formation,,this multi-step column of mantas,creates its own vortex, sucking innand delivering the plankton,right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.,The experience of divingnamongst such masses of hundreds of rays,is truly unforgettable. 
 (Music) 
 When I first photographed Hanifaru,,the site enjoyed no protection,and was threatened by development.,And working with NGOsnlike the Manta Trust,,my images eventually helped Hanifaru,become a marine-protected area.,Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,,they once hunted these manta rays,to make traditional drumsnfrom their skins.,Today, they are the most ardentnconservation champions,and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy,in excess of 8 million dollarsnevery single year. 
 I have always wantednto travel back in time,to an era where maps were mostly blank,or they read, "There be dragons.",And today, the closest I've comenis visiting remote atolls,in the western Indian Ocean.,Far, far away from shipping lanesnand fishing fleets,,diving into these watersnis a poignant reminder,of what our oceans once looked like. 
 Very few people have heardnof Bassas da India,,a tiny speck of coralnin the Mozambique Channel.,Its reef forms a protective outer barrier,and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground,for Galapagos sharks.,These sharks are anything but shy,neven during the day.,I had a bit of a hunchnthat they'd be even bolder,and more abundant at night. 
 (Music) 
 Never before have I encountered,so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.,Capturing and sharing moments like this --,that reminds me why I chose my path. 
 Earlier this year, I was on assignmentnfor National Geographic Magazine,in Baja California.,And about halfway down the peninsulanon the Pacific side,lies San Ignacio Lagoon,,a critical calving ground for gray whales.,For 100 years, this coast was the scenenof a wholesale slaughter,,where more than 20,000ngray whales were killed,,leaving only a few hundred survivors.,Today the descendents of these same whales,nudge their youngsters to the surface,to play and even interact with us. 
 (Music) 
 This species truly has madena remarkable comeback. 
 Now, on the other sidenof the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,,a sleepy fishing village.,Decades of overfishingnhad brought them close to collapse.,In 1995, local fishermannconvinced the authorities,to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.,But what happened nextnwas nothing short of miraculous.,In 2005, after onlyna single decade of protection,,scientists measured the largestnrecovery of fish ever recorded. 
 But don't take my wordnfor it -- come with me.,On a single breath, swim with me in deep,,into one of the largestnand densest schools of fish,I have ever encountered. 
 (Music) 
 We all have the abilitynto be creators of hope.,And through my photography,,I want to pass on the messagenthat it is not too late for our oceans.,And particularly, I want to focusnon nature's resilience,in the face of 7.3 billion people. 
 My hope is that in the future,,I will have to search much, much harder,to make photographs like this,,while creating images that showcase,our respectful coexistence with the ocean.,Those will hopefully becomenan everyday occurrence for me. 
 To thrive and survive in my profession,,you really have to be a hopeless optimist.,And I always operate on the assumption,that the next great picturenthat will effect change,is right around the corner,,behind the next coral head,,inside the next lagoon,or possibly, in the one after it. 
 (Music)You might think there arenmany things that I can't do,because I cannot see.,That's largely true.,Actually, I just needednto have a bit of help,to come up to the stage. 
 But there is also a lot that I can do.,This is me rock climbingnfor the first time.,Actually, I love sportsnand I can play many sports,,like swimming, skiing, skating,nscuba diving, running and so on.,But there is one limitation:,somebody needs to help me.,I want to be independent. 
 I lost my sight at the age of 14nin a swimming pool accident.,I was an active, independent teenager,,and suddenly I became blind.,The hardest thing for menwas losing my independence.,Things that until then seemed simplenbecame almost impossible to do alone.,For example, one of mynchallenges was textbooks.,Back then, there were nonpersonal computers,,no Internet, no smartphones.,So I had to ask one of my two brothersnto read me textbooks,,and I had to createnmy own books in Braille.,Can you imagine?,Of course, my brothersnwere not happy about it,,and later, I noticed they were not therenwhenever I needed them.,(Laughter),I think they tried to stay away from me.,I don't blame them.,I really wanted to be freednfrom relying on someone.,That became my strong desirento ignite innovation. 
 Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.,I got to know cutting-edge technologies,and I thought to myself,,how come there is no computer technology,to create books in Braille?,These amazing technologiesnmust be able to also help people,with limitations like myself.,That's the momentnmy innovation journey began. 
 I started developingndigital book technologies,,such as a digital Braille editor,ndigital Braille dictionary,and a digital Braille library network.,Today, every student who is visuallynimpaired can read textbooks,,by using personal computersnand mobile devices,,in Braille or in voice.,This may not surprise you,,since everyone now has digital booksnin their tablets in 2015.,But Braille went digitalnmany years before digital books,,already in the late 1980s,nalmost 30 years ago.,Strong and specific needsnof the blind people,made this opportunity to createndigital books way back then.,And this is actually notnthe first time this happened,,because history shows usnaccessibility ignites innovation.,The telephone was inventednwhile developing a communication tool,for hearing impaired people.,Some keyboards were also inventednto help people with disabilities. 
 Now I'm going to give younanother example from my own life.,In the '90s, people around menstarted talking about the Internet,and web browsing.,I remember the first timenI went on the web.,I was astonished.,I could access newspapersnat any time and every day.,I could even searchnfor any information by myself.,I desperately wanted to help the blindnpeople have access to the Internet,,and I found ways to render the webninto synthesized voice,,which dramatically simplifiednthe user interface. 
 This led me to developnthe Home Page Reader in 1997,,first in Japanese and later,ntranslated into 11 languages.,When I developed the Home Page Reader,,I got many comments from users.,One that I strongly remember said,,"For me, the Internetnis a small window to the world." 
 It was a revolutionary momentnfor the blind.,The cyber world became accessible,,and this technology that we creatednfor the blind has many uses,,way beyond what I imagined.,It can help drivers listen to their emails,or it can help you listennto a recipe while cooking. 
 Today, I am more independent,,but it is still not enough.,For example, when I approachednthe stage just now, I needed assistance.,My goal is to come up here independently.,And not just here.,My goal is to be able to travelnand do things that are simple to you. 
 OK, now let me show younthe latest technologies.,This is a smartphone appnthat we are working on. 
 (Video) Electronic voice: 51 feetnto the door, and keep straight. 
 EV: Take the two doors to go out.nThe door is on your right. 
 EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.,Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick! 
 (Laughter),CA: Where are you going?nYou look so happy. 
 Nick: Oh -- well, my papernjust got accepted.,CA: That's great! Congratulations. 
 Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you knownit was me, and that I look happy?,(Chieko and Nick laugh) 
 Man: Hi.,(Laughter),CA: Oh ... hi. 
 EV: He is not talking to you,nbut on his phone. 
 EV: Potato chips. 
 EV: Dark chocolate with almonds. 
 EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday;ntake apple instead of chocolate. 
 (Laughter) 
 EV: Approaching. 
 EV: You arrived. 
 CA: Now ... 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So now the app navigates me,by analyzing beacon signalsnand smartphone sensors,and permits me to move aroundnindoor and outdoor environments,all by myself.,But the computer vision partnthat showed who is approaching,,in which mood -- we are stillnworking on that part.,And recognizing facial expressionsnis very important for me to be social. 
 So now the fusions of technologiesnare ready to help me,see the real world.,We call this cognitive assistance.,It understands our surrounding world,and whispers to me in voicenor sends a vibration to my fingers.,Cognitive assistance will augmentnmissing or weakened abilities --,in other words, our five senses.,This technology is only in an early stage,,but eventually, I'll be able to findna classroom on campus,,enjoy window shopping,or find a nice restaurantnwhile walking along a street.,It will be amazing if I can find younon the street before you notice me.,It will become my best buddy, and yours. 
 So, this really is a great challenge.,It is a challengenthat needs collaboration,,which is why we are creatingnan open community,to accelerate research activities.,Just this morning, we announcednthe open-source fundamental technologies,you just saw in the video. 
 The frontier is the real world.,The blind community is exploringnthis technical frontier,and the pathfinder.,I hope to work with younto explore the new era,,and the next time that I'm on this stage,,through technology and innovation,,I will be able to walk up here,all by myself. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.,This might be the mostnimportant sneaker in history.,First released in 1988,,this is the shoe that startednNike marketing as we know it.,This is the shoe that propellednthe entire Air Jordan lineage,,and perhaps saved Nike.,The Air Jordan 3 Black Cementndid for sneakers,what the iPhone did for phones.,It's been re-released four times.,Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.,There's a site about what to wearnwith the Black Cement.,It's been right undernyour nose for decades,and you never looked down.,And right about now,,most of you are probablynthinking, "Sneakers?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes.,Yes, sneakers.,Some extraordinary things about sneakers,and data,and Nike,and how they're all related, possibly,nto the future of all online commerce. 
 In 2011,,the last time the Jordan 3nBlack Cement was released,,at a retail of 160 dollars,,it sold out globally in minutes.,And that's because people were campednoutside of sneaker stores,for days before it went on sale.,And just minutes after that,,thousands of those pairs were on eBaynfor two and three times retail.,In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBaynright now, four years later.,But here's the thing:,this happens every single Saturday.,Every week there's anothernrelease or two or three,,and every shoe has a story,as rich and compellingnas the Jordan 3 Black Cement. 
 This is Nike buildingnthe marketplace for sneakerheads --,people who collect sneakers --,and my daughter. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt. 
 For the brands, sneakerheadsnare a very important demographic.,These are the tastemakers;nthese are the Apple fanboys.,Because who else is going to buy,a pair of $8,000nBack to the Future sneakers? 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, 8,000 dollars. 
 And while that's obviously the anomaly,,the resell sneaker marketnis definitely not.,Thirty years in the making,,what started as an underground culture,of a few people who like sneakersnjust a bit too much -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Now we have sneaker addictions.,In a market where in the past 12 months,,there have been overnnine million pairs of shoes,resold in the United States alone,,at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.,And that's a conservative estimate --,I should know, I am a sneakerhead.,This is my collection.,In the pantheon of great collections,nmine doesn't even register.,I have about 250 pairs,nbut trust me, I am small-time.,People have thousands. 
 I'm a very typicaln37-year-old sneakerhead.,I grew up playing basketballnwhen Michael Jordan played,,I always wanted Air Jordans,,my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,,as soon as I got some moneynI bought Air Jordans --,literally, we all haventhe exact same story.,But here's where mine diverged.,After starting three companies,nI took a job as a strategy consultant,,when I very quickly realized thatnI didn't know the first thing about data.,But I learned, because I had to,,and I liked it.,So I thought, I wonder if I couldnget ahold of some sneaker data,,just to play with for my own amusement.,The goal was to develop a price guide,,a real data-driven view of the market.,And four years later, we're analyzingnover 25 million transactions,,providing real-time analyticsnon thousands of sneakers.,Now sneakerheads check pricesnwhile camping out for releases.,Others have used the datanto validate insurance claims.,And the top investment banks in the world,now use resell data to analyzenthe retail footwear industry.,And here's the best part:,sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sneakerheads can track the valuenof their collection over time,,compare it to others,,and have access to the samenanalytics you might,for your online brokerage account.,So sneakerhead Dan builds his collectionnand identifies which 352 are his.,He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --,frankly, a modest collection.,At the asset level,nhe can see gain-loss by shoe.,Here he's made overn600 dollars on one pair.,I have one of those. 
 (Laughter) 
 So an unregulatedn1.2 billion dollar industry,that thrives as much on the streetnas it does online,,and has spawned fundamentalnfinancial services for sneakers?,At some point I asked myselfnwhat's really going on in the market,,and two comparisons started to emerge.,Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs? 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, one guy emailed to say,he thought his 15-year-old sonnwas selling drugs,and later found outnhe was selling sneakers. 
 (Laughter) 
 And now they use the datanto do it together.,And that's because sneakersnare an investment opportunity,where none other exists.,And I don't just mean the kidnselling sneakers instead of drugs.,How about all kids?,You have to be 18nto play the stock market.,I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,,Blow Pops in ninth grade,and collected baseball cardsnthrough high school.,The cards are long dead,,and the candy market'snusually quite local. 
 For a lot of people, sneakers are a legalnand accessible investment opportunity --,a democratized stock market,,but also unregulated.,Which is why the storynyou're probably most familiar with,is people killing each other for sneakers.,And while that definitelynhappens and is tragic,,it's not nearly the epidemicnsome media would have you believe.,In fact, it's a very small piecenof a much bigger and better story. 
 So sneakers have clear similarities,to both the stock exchangenand the illegal drug trade,,but perhaps the most fundamentalnis the existence of a central actor.,Someone is making the rules.,In the case of sneakers,nthat someone is Nike. 
 Let me walk you through some numbers. 
 The resell market,nwe know, is $1.2 billion.,Nike, including Jordan brand,,accounts for 96 percent of all shoesnsold on the secondary market.,Just complete domination.,Sneakerheads love Jordans.,And profit on the secondary marketnis about a third.,That means that sneakerheadsnmade 380 million dollars,selling Nikes last year.,Let's jump to retail for a second.,Skechers, earlier this year,,became the number twonfootwear brand in the country,,surpassing Adidas --nthis was a big deal.,And in the 12 months ending in June,,Skechers's net incomenwas 209 million dollars.,That means that Nike's customers,make almost twice as much profitnas their closest competitor.,That -- 
 (Laughter) 
 How is that even possible? 
 The sneaker marketnis just supply and demand,,but Nike's gotten very good at usingnsupply -- limited sneakers --,and the distribution of those sneakersnto their own benefit.,So it's really just supply.,Sneakerheads joke that as longnas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.,Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollarsndo so because they're very rare.,It's no different than any otherncollectible market,,only this isn't a market at all.,It's a false construct created by Nike --,ingeniously created by Nike, in the mostnpositive sense -- to sell more shoes.,And in the process,,it provided tens of thousands of peoplenwith life-long passions,,myself included.,If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,nthey could do so tomorrow,,all they have to do is release more shoes.,But we certainly don't want them to,nnor is it in their best interest.,That's because unlike Apple, who will sellnan iPhone to anyone who wants one,,Nike doesn't make their moneynby just selling $200 sneakers.,They sell millions of shoes to millionsnof people for 60 dollars.,And sneakerheads are the onesnwho drive the marketing,and the hype and the PRnand the brand cachet,,and enable Nike to sell millionsnof $60 sneakers. 
 It's marketing.,It's marketing the likes of whichnhas never been seen before --,this isn't in any textbook.,For 15 years Nike has propped upnan artificial commodities market,,with a Facebook-level hyped IPOnevery single weekend.,Drive by any Footlocker at 8amnon a Saturday morning,,and there will be a line down the streetnand around the block,,and sometimes those kidsnhave been waiting there all week.,You know those crazy iPhone linesnyou see on the news every other year?,Nike lines happen 104 times more often.,So Nike sets the rules.,And they do so by controllingnsupply and distribution. 
 But once a pair leavesnthe retail channel, it's the Wild West.,There are very few -- if any --nlegal, unregulated markets of this size.,So Nike is definitelynnot the stock exchange.,In fact, there is no central exchange.,By last count, there were 48 differentnonline markets that I know of.,Some are eBay clones,nsome are mobile markets,,and then you have consignment shopsnand brick-and-mortar stores,,and sneaker conventions,nand reseller sites,,and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --,literally, anywhere sneakerheadsncome into contact with each other,,shoes will be bought and sold. 
 But that means no efficiencies,nno transparency,,sometimes not even authenticity.,Can you imagine if that'snhow stocks were bought?,What if the way to buyna share of Apple stock,was to search over 100 placesnonline and off,,including every timenyou walk down the street,just hoping to pass someonenwearing some Apple stock?,Never knowing who had the best price,,or even if the stocknyou were looking at was real.,That would surely make you say: 
 [WTF?] 
 Of course that's not how we buy stock.,But what if that's not hownwe need to buy sneakers either?,What if the inverse is true,,and what if we could buy sneakers,exactly the same way as we buy stock?,And what if it wasn't just sneakers,nbut any similar product,,like watches and handbagsnand women's shoes,,and any collectible, any seasonal itemnand any markdown item?,What if there wasna stock market for commerce?,A stock market of things.,And not only could you buy in a much moreneducated and efficient manner,,but you could engage in allnthe sophisticated financial transactions,you can with the stock market.,Shorts and options and futures,and well, maybe you seenwhere this is going.,Maybe you want to investnin a stock market of things.,Because if you had invested in a pairnof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,,you could either be wearing them onstage, 
 (Laughter) 
 or have earned 162 percentnon your money --,double the S&P and 20 percentnmore than Apple. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's whynwe're talking about sneakers. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I spend most of my time,thinking about little girls,,which is kind of a weird thingnfor a grown man in our society to say.,But I do. I spend most of my timenthinking about little girls,,and I think it's primarilynbecause I have one.,This one's mine, and I thinknyou would really like her.,She is smart and funny,and kind to people and a good friend.,But when I talk about my daughter,nthe word I find myself saying most,is "athlete.",My kid's athletic.,She is strong and fast,and has great balancenand good body control.,She is a three-time,nback-to-back-to-back state champion,in Shaolin Kempo.,At nine years old, she is alreadynhalfway to a black belt.,My daughter is athletic. 
 Now, when a man who is six feet twonand 265 pounds stands in front of you,and says his daughter is athletic,,you might thinknthat's a reflection of him.,It is not. 
 (Laughter) 
 My wife in high schoolnwas a two-time all-state soccer player,and a two-time all-statenvolleyball player,,and I played "Dungeons and Dragons.",And that is why,,although my daughter is an athlete,,she's also a huge nerd, which I love.,She walks around our housenin a cloak of flames,that she made herself.,She sits on the Iron Throne -- 
 (Laughter) 
 even though she has nevernseen "Game of Thrones,",primarily because we are notnthe worst parents who ever lived.,But she knows there's someonencalled the Mother of Dragons,,and she calls herself thatnand she loves it.,She's a huge comic book fan.,Right now, her favoritencharacter is Groot.,She loves Groot.,She adores The Incredible Hulk.,But my daughter really at heart,,her thing is Star Wars.,My kid is a Jedi.,Although some days she's also a Sith,,which is a choice that I can respect. 
 (Laughter) 
 But here's the questionnthat I have to ask.,Why is it that whennmy daughter dresses up,,whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,,whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,,why is every characternshe dresses up as a boy?,And where are all the female superheroes?,And that is not actually the question,,because there's plentynof female superheroes.,My question really is,nwhere is all the female superhero stuff?,Where are the costumes?nWhere are the toys? 
 Because every day when my daughternplays when she dresses up,,she's learning stuff,through a process that,nin my own line of work,,as a professor of media studies,,we refer to as public pedagogy.,That is, it is how societiesnare taught ideologies.,It's how you learned what it meantnto be a man or a woman,,what it meant to behavenyourself in public,,what it meant to be a patriotnand have good manners.,It's all the constituent social relationsnthat make us up as a people.,It's, in short, how we learnnwhat we know about other people,and about the world.,But we live in a 100-percentnmedia-saturated society.,What that means is that every singlenaspect of your human existence,outside of your basic bodily functions,is in some way touched by media.,From the car that you drivento the food that you eat,to the clothes that you wear,to the way you constructnyour relationships,to the very languagenyou use to formulate thought --,all of that is in some way mediated.,So the answer in our society,to how do we learn what we knownabout other people and about the world,is largely through media. 
 Well, there's a wrinkle in that,,in that our society,,media don't simply exist as informationndistribution technologies and devices.,They also exist as corporate entities.,And when the distribution of informationnis tied to financial gain,,there's a problem.,How big of a problem?,Well think about this:,in 1983, 90 percent of American medianwere owned by 50 companies.,In any market, 50 companiesndoing something is a lot of companies.,It's a lot of different worldviews.,In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,,six companies.,They are NBCUniversal Comcast,nAOL Time Warner,,the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,nViacom and the CBS Corporation.,These six companies producennine out of every 10 movies you watch,,nine out of every 10 television shows,nnine out of every 10 songs,,nine out of every 10 books.,So my question to you is,,if six companies controln90 percent of American media,,how much influence do you think they havenover what you're allowed to see every day? 
 Because in media studies,,we spend a lot of time sayingnthat media can't tell us what to think,,and they can't; they're terrible at that.,But that's not their job.,Media don't tell us what to think.,Media tell us what to think about.,They control the conversation,,and in controlling the conversation,,they don't have to get younto think what they want you to think.,They'll just get you thinking aboutnthe things they want you to think about,,and more importantly, not thinking aboutnthings they don't want you to think about.,They control the conversation. 
 How does this work in practice?,Let's just take one of those companies.,We'll do an easy one.,Let's talk about the Walt DisneynCompany for a second.,The reason why I always picknthe Walt Disney Company is this.,Is there a single person in this roomnwho has never seen a Disney movie?,Look around. Exactly.,I picked Disney because they havenwhat we call 100 percent penetration,in our society.,Every single personnhas been exposed to Disney,,so it's an easy one for me to use.,Since 1937, Disney has made mostnof its money selling princesses to girls.,It's made a huge chunk of its money.,Unless, of course, the princessnyour daughter is interested in,,as my daughter is, is this one. 
 See, in 2012,,Disney purchased LucasFilmnfor the sum of four billion dollars,,and immediately they floodednthe Disney stores with Han Solo,and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vadernand Luke Skywalker and Yoda,and not Princess Leia.,Why? Because this princessnmesses up the public pedagogy,for these princesses.,So Disney did not put Princess Leianmerchandise in the store,,and when people went to Disney and said,,"Hey, where's allnthe Princess Leia stuff?",Disney said, "We have no intention,of putting Princess Leianmerchandise in the store.",And fans were angrynand they took to Twitter,with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.,And Disney said,n"Wait, that's not what we meant.,What we meant was,,we don't have any Princess Leianmerchandise yet, but we will.",And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,,and if you go to the Disney Store,nas I recently have,,and look for Princess Leia merchandise,,do you know how many Princess Leianitems there are in the Disney Store?,Zero, because Disney has no intentionnof putting Princess Leia in the store. 
 And we shouldn't be surprisednbecause we found out that was their policy,when they bought Marvel in 2009,for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.,Because when you make a lot of moneynselling princesses to girls,,you also kind of wantnto make money from boys.,And so what better to sell boysnthan superheroes?,So now Disney had accessnto Captain America and to Thor,,The Incredible Hulk,,and they had access even,to a group of superheroesnno one had ever even heard of.,That's how good Marvel wasnat selling superheroes. 
 Last year, they released a filmncalled "Guardians of the Galaxy.",It's a film that absolutelynshould not work.,Nobody knew who they werenexcept for comic book nerds like me.,One of the characters is a talking tree.,One of the charactersnis an anthropomorphic raccoon.,It should not work.,And they made a killingnoff of "Guardians of the Galaxy." 
 This character here in the middle,nher name is Gamora.,She's played by Zoe Saldana,,and she is strong and smart and fastnand fights like a ninja,,and she is playednby a beautiful black woman,,and my daughter fell in love with her.,So like any good nerd dad,nI went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,,and when I got to the store,nI learned a very interesting thing.,If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,,well, Gamora's not on it.,They probably should have marketed thisnas "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox,nshe wasn't on it,,and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,,she wasn't on it.,And as a matter of fact,,if I went to the store, as I did,,and looked at the display,,you would find a small picturenof Gamora right here,,but if you look at anynof the actual merchandise on that shelf,,Gamora is not on any of it. 
 Now, I could have taken to Twitternwith the hashtag #WheresGamora,,like millions of fans didnacross the world,,but the truth wasnI wasn't even really that surprised,,because I was therenwhen Disney had released "The Avengers.",And just this year, we gotna new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,",and we were very excited,,because there was not onenbut two female superheroes,,Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.,And we were very excited.,But here's the real thing about this.,Even though Scarlett Johansson,,who is one of the most popularnactresses in America, plays Black Widow,,and Black Widow is the star,of not one, not two,nbut five different Marvel movies,,there is not a single piecenof Black Widow merchandise available.,Not one.,And if you go to the Disney storenand look for a Black Widow costume,,what you will find, is you will findnCaptain America and The Incredible Hulk.,You will find Iron Man and Thor.,You will even find War Machine,,who isn't even reallynin the movie that long.,Who you will not find is Black Widow.,And I could have gone to Twitternwith the hashtag, as many people did,,# WheresNatasha.,But I'm tired of doing that.,I'm tired of having to do that. 
 All over the country right now,,there are kids playingnwith the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set,,where Captain Americanrides a motorcycle out of a moving jet,and it's really awesome.,You know how awesome it is?,So awesome that whennit happened in the movie,,it was Black Widow that did it.,Not only has she been erased,,but she has been replacednwith a male figure. 
 And so what is this teaching us?,I mean, over the next five years,,Disney and Warner Bros.nand a bunch of movie studios,are going to releasenover 30 feature-length films,with comic book characters,,and of those 30 feature-length films,,exactly two of themnwill have female solo leads.,Two.,Now, there will be femalesnin the rest of these movies,,but they will be sidekicks,nthey will be love interests,,they will be members of teams.,They will not be the main character.,And if what we learn, what we know,about other people and about the worldnwe learn through media,,then these companies are teachingnmy daughter that even if she is strong,and smart and fastnand fights like a ninja,,all four of which are true of her,,it doesn't matter.,She will either be ignored like Gamora,or erased and replaced with a boy,like Black Widow.,And it's not fair.,It's not fair to her and it's not fairnto your sons and daughters either. 
 But here's the thing:,I'm raising a little girl,nand she has a little tomboy in her,,which by the way isna terrible thing to call a girl.,What that basically is saying is,nthose traits that define you,,they're not really yours,,they're just on loan to younfor a little while from boys.,But do you know how much griefnshe's going to take in her life,for having a little tomboy in her?,Zero. None.,People will think it's cute.,They'll call her feisty,nbecause in our society,,adding so-called male traits to girls,is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.,I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike. 
 Mike is a little boy in Florida.nHe's 11 years old,,and the thing that he lovesnmost in the world,is a show called "My Little Pony:nFriendship is Magic,",like millions of other childrennacross America.,Now, the show is marketed to girlsnages five to nine,,but there are millions of boys,and grown men,who enjoy "My Little Pony:nFriendship is Magic.",They have a club.,They call themselves Bronies,,pony bros, guys who like ponies.,I happen to be one of them.,And what are Mike and myself,and millions of other boys and mennlearning in this feminine,,sissified world of "My Little Pony?",Well, they're learning to study hardnand to work hard and to party hard,and to look good and to feel good,and to do good,,and heaven preserve us from teachingnthese wussified concepts to boys. 
 So the other kids in his neighborhoodnpick on Mike and they beat him up,and they make fun of him,,and at 11 years old, Mike goes home,,finds a belt, wraps it around his neck,,and hangs himselfnfrom the top bunk of his bed.,Because we have developed a society,in which you would rather be dead as a boynthan thought of as liking stuff for girls.,And that is not Mike's fault.nThat is our fault.,We have failed him.,We have failed our children.,And we have to do better for them.,We have to stop making itnso that the only female superheroes,appear on shirts that are pinknand cut for girls.,We have to stop. 
 And when I was putting this together,npeople said to me,,"Well, that's never going to happen."nAnd I said, "Oh really?",Because just this year, Target announced,that they were going to stopngendering their toy aisles.,They were going to mix it up.,Now, before we break our shouldersnpatting Target on the back,,just this week they released a shirt,in which one of the mostniconic scenes in "Star Wars: A New Hope",where Princess Leia stands upnto the Dark Lord of the Sith,,was released on a t-shirt,in which she's mysteriouslynreplaced by Luke.,So let's don't pat ourselvesnon the back too much.,Just this week also,,Disney announced it was no longerngoing to gender its Halloween costumes,,which I say, "Thank you, Disney,,except the only costumes you makenare of male superheroes,,so does it matternwho you have wearing them?",Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,,announced they're going to releasena line of DC superhero girls.,And the funny thing is,,they met with girls,and asked them what theynwanted to see in dolls,,and you can see, they have calves,and elbows that bendnso they can do superhero stuff.,And please buy them.,And don't just buy themnfor your daughters,,buy them for your sons.,Because it's important that boysnplay with and as female superheroes,just as my daughter playsnwith and as male superheroes. 
 As a matter of fact, what I would love,is a world in which every personnwho goes to the store,goes with a little flowchart in their head,of whether or not they should buynthis toy for a boy or a girl,,and it's a real simple flowchartnbecause it only has one question on it.,It says, "Is this toynoperated with your genitals?" 
 (Laughter) 
 If the answer is yes,,then that is not a toy for children. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if the answer is no,,then it's for boys and girls.,It's really simple.,Because today is about the futurenof the future, and in my future,,boys and girls are equally respected,,equally valued, and most importantly,nequally represented. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What does a working mother look like?,If you ask the Internet,nthis is what you'll be told.,Never mind that this isnwhat you'll actually produce,if you attempt to work at a computernwith a baby on your lap. 
 (Laughter) 
 But no, this isn't a working mother.,You'll notice a theme in these photos.nWe'll look at a lot of them.,That theme is amazing natural lighting,,which, as we all know,,is the hallmarknof every American workplace. 
 There are thousands of images like these.,Just put the term "working mother"ninto any Google image search engine,,stock photo site.,They're all over the Internet,,they're toppingnblog posts and news pieces,,and I've become kind of obsessed with themnand the lie that they tell us,and the comfort that they give us,,that when it comesnto new working motherhood in America,,everything's fine. 
 But it's not fine.,As a country, we are sendingnmillions of women back to work,every year, incrediblynand kind of horrifically soon,after they give birth.,That's a moral problem,but today I'm also going to tell younwhy it's an economic problem. 
 I got so annoyed and obsessednwith the unreality of these images,,which look nothing like my life,,that I recently decided to shoot and starnin a parody series of stock photos,that I hoped the world would start to use,just showing the really awkward realitynof going back to work,when your baby's food sourcenis attached to your body.,I'm just going to show you two of them. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion"nlike leaking breast milk,through your dress during a presentation.,You'll notice that there'snno baby in this photo,,because that's not how this works,,not for most working mothers. 
 Did you know, and this will ruin your day,,that every time a toilet is flushed,nits contents are aerosolized,and they'll stay airborne for hours?,And yet, for many new working mothers,,this is the only place during the daynthat they can find to make food,for their newborn babies. 
 I put these things,na whole dozen of them, into the world.,I wanted to make a point.,I didn't know what I was also doingnwas opening a door,,because now, total strangersnfrom all walks of life,write to me all the time,just to tell me what it's likenfor them to go back to work,within days or weeks of having a baby.,I'm going to sharen10 of their stories with you today.,They are totally real,nsome of them are very raw,,and not one of themnlooks anything like this. 
 Here's the first.,"I was an active dutynservice member at a federal prison.,I returned to work after the maximumnallowed eight weeks for my C-section.,A male coworker was annoyednthat I had been out on 'vacation,',so he intentionally opened the door on menwhile I was pumping breast milk,and stood in the doorwaynwith inmates in the hallway." 
 Most of the stories that these women,ntotal strangers, send to me now,,are not actually even about breastfeeding. 
 A woman wrote to me to say,,"I gave birth to twins and went backnto work after seven unpaid weeks.,Emotionally, I was a wreck.,Physically, I had a severe hemorrhagenduring labor, and major tearing,,so I could barely get up, sit or walk.,My employer told me I wasn't allowednto use my available vacation days,because it was budget season." 
 I've come to believe that we can't looknsituations like these in the eye,because then we'd be horrified,,and if we get horrifiednthen we have to do something about it.,So we choose to look at,nand believe, this image.,I don't really knownwhat's going on in this picture,,because I find it weirdnand slightly creepy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Like, what is she doing?,But I know what it tells us.,It tells us that everything's fine.,This working mother, all working mothersnand all of their babies, are fine.,There's nothing to see here.,And anyway, women have made a choice,,so none of it's even our problem. 
 I want to break this choice thingndown into two parts.,The first choice saysnthat women have chosen to work.,So, that's not true.,Today in America, women make upn47 percent of the workforce,,and in 40 percent of American households,a woman is the solenor primary breadwinner.,Our paid work is a part, a huge part,nof the engine of this economy,,and it is essentialnfor the engines of our families.,On a national level,nour paid work is not optional. 
 Choice number two says that womennare choosing to have babies,,so women alone should bearnthe consequences of those choices.,You know, that's one of those things,that when you hear it in passing,ncan sound correct.,I didn't make you have a baby.,I certainly wasn't therenwhen that happened.,But that stancenignores a fundamental truth,,which is that our procreationnon a national scale is not optional.,The babies that women, many of themnworking women, are having today,,will one day fill our workforce,nprotect our shores,,make up our tax base.,Our procreationnon a national scale is not optional.,These aren't choices.,We need women to work.nWe need working women to have babies.,So we should makendoing those things at the same time,at least palatable, right? 
 OK, this is pop quiz time:,what percentage of workingnwomen in America do you think,have no access to paid maternity leave?,88 percent.,88 percent of working mothersnwill not get one minute of paid leave,after they have a baby. 
 So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.,It exists in America.nIt's called FMLA. It does not work.,Because of the way it's structured,nall kinds of exceptions,,half of new mothers are ineligible for it. 
 Here's what that looks like.,"We adopted our son.,When I got the call, the day he was born,nI had to take off work.,I had not been there long enoughnto qualify for FMLA,,so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.,When I took time offnto meet my newborn son,,I lost my job." 
 These corporate stock photosnhide another reality, another layer.,Of those who do have accessnto just that unpaid leave,,most women can't affordnto take much of it at all.,A nurse told me, "I didn't qualifynfor short-term disability,because my pregnancynwas considered a preexisting condition.,We used up all of our tax returnsnand half of our savings,during my six unpaid weeks.,We just couldn't manage any longer.,Physically it was hard,nbut emotionally it was worse.,I struggled for monthsnbeing away from my son." 
 So this decisionnto go back to work so early,,it's a rational economic decisionndriven by family finances,,but it's often physically horrific,because putting a humanninto the world is messy. 
 A waitress told me,,"With my first baby, I was backnat work five weeks postpartum.,With my second, I had to havenmajor surgery after giving birth,,so I waited until six weeks to go back.,I had third degree tears." 
 23 percent of newnworking mothers in America,will be back on the jobnwithin two weeks of giving birth. 
 "I worked as a bartender and cook,naverage of 75 hours a week while pregnant.,I had to return to worknbefore my baby was a month old,,working 60 hours a week.,One of my coworkers was only ablento afford 10 days off with her baby." 
 Of course, this isn't just a scenarionwith economic and physical implications.,Childbirth is, and always will be,nan enormous psychological event. 
 A teacher told me,,"I returned to workneight weeks after my son was born.,I already suffer from anxiety,,but the panic attacks I had priornto returning to work were unbearable." 
 Statistically speaking,,the shorter a woman's leavenafter having a baby,,the more likely she will be to suffernfrom postpartum mood disorders,like depression and anxiety,,and among many potentialnconsequences of those disorders,,suicide is the secondnmost common cause of death,in a woman's first year postpartum. 
 Heads up that this next story --,I've never met this woman,nbut I find it hard to get through. 
 "I feel tremendous grief and ragenthat I lost an essential,,irreplaceable and formativentime with my son.,Labor and deliverynleft me feeling absolutely broken.,For months, all I remembernis the screaming: colic, they said.,On the inside, I was drowning.,Every morning, I asked myselfnhow much longer I could do it.,I was allowed to bring my baby to work.,I closed my office doornwhile I rocked and shushed,and begged him to stop screamingnso I wouldn't get in trouble.,I hid behind that office doornevery damn day,and cried while he screamed.,I cried in the bathroomnwhile I washed out the pump equipment.,Every day, I cried all the way to worknand all the way home again.,I promised my boss that the worknI didn't get done during the day,,I'd make up at night from home.,I thought, there's just somethingnwrong with me that I can't swing this." 
 So those are the mothers.,What of the babies?,As a country, do we carenabout the millions of babies,born every year to working mothers?,I say we don't,,not until they're of workingnand tax-paying and military-serving age.,We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,,and getting there is kind of on them.,One of the reasons I know thisnis that babies whose mothers,have 12 or more weeks at home with them,are more likely to get their vaccinationsnand their well checks in their first year,,so those babies are more protectednfrom deadly and disabling diseases.,But those things are hiddennbehind images like this. 
 America has a message for new mothersnwho work and for their babies.,Whatever time you get together,nyou should be grateful for it,,and you're an inconvenience,to the economy and to your employers.,That narrative of gratitudenruns through a lot of the stories I hear. 
 A woman told me,,"I went back at eight weeksnafter my C-section,because my husband was out of work.,Without me, my daughternhad failure to thrive.,She wouldn't take a bottle.,She started losing weight.,Thankfully, my managernwas very understanding.,He let my mom bring my baby,,who was on oxygen and a monitor,,four times a shift so I could nurse her." 
 There's a little clubnof countries in the world,that offer no nationalnpaid leave to new mothers.,Care to guess who they are?,The first eight make up eight millionnin total population.,They are Papua New Guinea,nSuriname and the tiny island nations,of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,nNauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.,Number nine isnthe United States of America,,with 320 million people.,Oh, that's it.,That's the end of the list.,Every other economy on the planet,has found a way to make some levelnof national paid leave work,for the people doing the worknof the future of those countries,,but we say,n"We couldn't possibly do that.",We say that the marketnwill solve this problem,,and then we cheer when corporationsnoffer even more paid leave to the women,who are already the highest-educatednand highest-paid among us.,Remember that 88 percent?,Those middle- and low-income womennare not going to participate in that.,We know that there are staggeringneconomic, financial, physical,and emotional costs to this approach.,We have decided --ndecided, not an accident,,to pass these costs directlynon to working mothers and their babies.,We know the price tag is highernfor low-income women,,therefore disproportionatelynfor women of color.,We pass them on anyway. 
 All of this is to America's shame.,But it's also to America's risk.,Because what would happen,if all of these individualnso-called choices to have babies,started to turn into individual choicesnnot to have babies. 
 One woman told me,,"New motherhood is hard.nIt shouldn't be traumatic.,When we talk about expandingnour family now,,we focus on how much time I would havento care for myself and a new baby.,If we were to have to do it againnthe same way as with our first,,we might stick with one kid." 
 The birthrate needed in Americanto keep the population stable,is 2.1 live births per woman.,In America today, we are at 1.86.,We need women to have babies,,and we are actively disincentivizingnworking women from doing that.,What would happen to work force,nto innovation, to GDP,,if one by one, the working mothersnof this country were to decide,that they can't bearnto do this thing more than once? 
 I'm here today with onlynone idea worth spreading,,and you've guessed what it is.,It is long since timenfor the most powerful country on Earth,to offer national paid leave,to the people doing the worknof the future of this country,and to the babiesnwho represent that future.,Childbirth is a public good.,This leave should be state-subsidized.,It should have no exceptionsnfor small businesses,,length of employment or entrepreneurs.,It should be ablento be shared between partners.,I've talked today a lot about mothers,,but co-parents matter on so many levels. 
 Not one more womannshould have to go back to work,while she is hobbling and bleeding.,Not one more family should havento drain their savings account,to buy a few daysnof rest and recovery and bonding.,Not one more fragile infant,should have to go directlynfrom the incubator to day care,because his parents have used upnall of their meager time,sitting in the NICU.,Not one more working familynshould be told that the collision,of their work, their needed worknand their needed parenthood,,is their problem alone. 
 The catch is that when this is happeningnto a new family, it is consuming,,and a family with a new babynis more financially vulnerable,than they've ever been before,,so that new mother cannot affordnto speak up on her own behalf.,But all of us have voices.,I am done, done having babies,,and you might be pre-baby,,you might be post-baby,,you might be no baby.,It should not matter.,We have to stop framing thisnas a mother's issue,,or even a women's issue.,This is an American issue. 
 We need to stop buying the lienthat these images tell us.,We need to stop being comforted by them.,We need to questionnwhy we're told that this can't work,when we see it workneverywhere all over the world.,We need to recognizenthat this American reality,is to our dishonor and to our peril.,Because this is not,,this is not,,and this is notnwhat a working mother looks like. 
 (Applause)Our lives depend,on a world we can't see.,Think about your week so far.,Have you watched TV, used GPS,,checked the weather or even ate a meal?,These many thingsnthat enable our daily lives,rely either directly or indirectly,on satellites.,And while we often take for granted,the services that satellites provide us,,the satellites themselvesndeserve our attention,as they are leaving a lasting mark,on the space they occupy. 
 People around the worldnrely on satellite infrastructure every day,for information, entertainmentnand to communicate.,There's agriculturalnand environmental monitoring,,Internet connectivity, navigation.,Satellites even play a role,in the operation of our financialnand energy markets.,But these satellites that we rely on,day in and day out,have a finite life.,They might run out of propellant,,they could malfunction,,or they may just naturallynreach the end of their mission life.,At this point, these satellitesneffectively become space junk,,cluttering the orbital environment. 
 So imagine you're driving down the highwaynon a beautiful, sunny day,out running errands.,You've got your music cranked,,your windows rolled down,,with the cool breezenblowing through your hair.,Feels nice, right?,Everything is going smoothly,until suddenlynyour car stutters and stalls,right in the middle of the highway.,So now you have no choicenbut to abandon your car,where it is on the highway.,Maybe you were lucky enough,to be able to move it out of the waynand into a shoulder lane,so that it's out of the waynof other traffic.,A couple of hours ago,,your car was a useful machinenthat you relied on in your everyday life.,Now, it's a useless hunk of metal,taking up space in a valuablentransportation network.,And imagine international roadwaysnall cluttered with broken down vehicles,that are just getting in the waynof other traffic.,And imagine the debrisnthat would be strewn everywhere,if a collision actually happened,,thousands of smaller pieces of debris,becoming new obstacles. 
 This is the paradigmnof the satellite industry.,Satellites that are no longer working,are often left to deorbitnover many, many years,,or only moved out of the waynas a temporary solution.,And there are noninternational laws in space,to enforce us to clean up after ourselves. 
 So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,,was launched in 1957,,and in that year, there werenonly a total of three launch attempts.,Decades later and dozens of countriesnfrom all around the world,have launched thousandsnof more satellites into orbit,,and the frequency of launchesnis only going to increase in the future,,especially if you considernthings like the possibility,of 900-plus satellitenconstellations being launched. 
 Now, we send satellitesnto different orbits,depending on what they're needed for.,One of the most common placesnwe send satellites,is the low Earth orbit,,possibly to image the surface of Earth,at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.,Satellites there are naturally buffetednby Earth's atmosphere,,so their orbits naturally decay,,and they'll eventually burn up,,probably within a couple of decades.,Another common place we send satellites,is the geostationary orbit,at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.,Satellites there remain in the same placenabove Earth as the Earth rotates,,which enables things like communicationsnor television broadcast, for example.,Satellites in high orbits like thesencould remain there for centuries.,And then there's the orbitncoined "the graveyard,",the ominous junk or disposal orbits,,where some satellitesnare intentionally placed,at the end of their life,so that they're out of the waynof common operational orbits. 
 Of the nearly 7,000 satellitesnlaunched since the late 1950s,,only about one in sevennis currently operational,,and in addition to the satellitesnthat are no longer working,,there's also hundreds of thousandsnof marble-sized debris,and millions of paint chip-sized debris,that are also orbiting around the Earth.,Space debris is a major risknto space missions,,but also to the satellitesnthat we rely on each and every day. 
 Now, because space debris and junknhas become increasingly worrisome,,there have been some nationalnand international efforts,to develop technical standards,to help us limit the generationnof additional debris.,So for example, there are recommendations,for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft,to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,,but that's still a really long time,,especially if a satellitenhasn't been working for years.,There's also mandatesnfor those dead geostationary spacecraft,to be moved into a graveyard orbit.,But neither of these guidelinesnis binding under international law,,and the understanding is that they will benimplemented through national mechanisms.,These guidelines are also not long-term,,they're not proactive,,nor do they addressnthe debris that's already up there.,They're only in placento limit the future creation of debris.,Space junk is no one's responsibility. 
 Now, Mount Everest is actuallynan interesting comparison,of a new approach to hownwe interact with our environments,,as it's often given the dubious honor,of being the world's highest garbage dump.,Decades after the first conquestnof the world's highest peak,,tons of rubbish left behind by climbers,has started to raise concern,,and you may have read in the newsnthat there's speculation,that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers,with stricter enforcementnof penalties and legal obligations.,The goal, of course,nis to persuade climbers,to clean up after themselves,,so maybe local not-for-profits will paynclimbers who bring down extra waste,,or expeditions might organizenvoluntary cleanup trips.,And yet still many climbers feel,that independent groupsnshould police themselves.,There's no simple or easy answer,,and even well-intentionednefforts at conservation,often run into problems.,But that doesn't meannwe shouldn't do everything in our power,to protect the environmentsnthat we rely and depend on,,and like Everest, the remote locationnand inadequate infrastructure,of the orbital environment,make waste disposal a challenging problem.,But we simply cannot reach new heights,and create an even higher garbage dump,,one that's out of this world. 
 The reality of space,is that if a componentnon a satellite breaks down,,there really are limitednopportunities for repairs,,and only at great cost.,But what if we were smarternabout how we designed satellites?,What if all satellites,,regardless of what countrynthey were built in,,had to be standardized in some way,for recycling, servicing,or active deorbiting?,What if there actually wereninternational laws with teeth,that enforced end-of-lifendisposal of satellites,instead of moving them out of the way,as a temporary solution?,Or maybe satellite manufacturersnneed to be charged a deposit,to even launch a satellite into orbit,,and that deposit would only be returned,if the satellite was disposed of properly,or if they cleaned upnsome quota of debris.,Or maybe a satellitenneeds to have technology on board,to help accelerate deorbit. 
 There are some encouraging signs.,The UK's TechDemoSat-1,nlaunched in 2014, for example,,was designed for end-of-life disposal,via a small drag sail.,This works for the satellitenbecause it's small,,but satellites that are highernor in larger orbits,or are larger altogether,nlike the size of school buses,,will require other disposal options.,So maybe you get into thingsnlike high-powered lasers,or tugging using nets or tethers,,as crazy as those sound in the short term. 
 And then one really cool possibility,is the idea of orbital tow trucksnor space mechanics.,Imagine if a robotic arm,on some sort of space tow truck,could fix the broken componentsnon a satellite,,making them usable again.,Or what if that very same robotic arm,could refuel the propellant tanknon a spacecraft,that relies on chemical propulsion,just like you or I would refuelnthe fuel tanks on our cars?,Robotic repair and maintenance,could extend the lives of hundredsnof satellites orbiting around the Earth. 
 Whatever the disposalnor cleanup options we come up with,,it's clearly not just a technical problem.,There's also complex space lawsnand politics that we have to sort out.,Simply put, we haven't found a waynto use space sustainably yet. 
 Exploring, innovatingnto change the way we live and work,are what we as humans do,,and in space exploration,,we're literally movingnbeyond the boundaries of Earth.,But as we push thresholdsnin the name of learning and innovation,,we must remember that accountabilitynfor our environments never goes away.,There is without doubt congestionnin the low Earth and geostationary orbits,,and we cannot keepnlaunching new satellites,to replace the ones that have broken down,without doing something about them first,,just like we would nevernleave a broken down car,in the middle of the highway.,Next time you use your phone,,check the weather or use your GPS,,think about the satellite technologiesnthat make those activities possible.,But also think about the very impact,that the satellites havenon the environment surrounding Earth,,and help spread the messagenthat together we must reduce our impact. 
 Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful,and our gateway to exploration.,It's up to us to keep it that way. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)On January 26, 2013,,a band of al-Qaeda militantsnentered the ancient city of Timbuktu,on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.,There, they set fire to a medieval librarynof 30,000 manuscripts,written in Arabicnand several African languages,and ranging in subject from astronomynto geography, history to medicine,,including one book which records,perhaps the first treatmentnfor male erectile dysfunction.,Unknown in the West,,this was the collected wisdomnof an entire continent,,the voice of Africa at a time when Africanwas thought not to have a voice at all.,The mayor of Bamako,nwho witnessed the event,,called the burning of the manuscripts,"a crime against world cultural heritage.",And he was right --,or he would have been, if it weren'tnfor the fact that he was also lying. 
 In fact, just before,,African scholars had collectedna random assortment of old books,and left them outnfor the terrorists to burn.,Today, the collectionnlies hidden in Bamako,,the capital of Mali,,moldering in the high humidity.,What was rescued by ruse,is now once again in jeopardy,,this time by climate. 
 But Africa, and the far-flungncorners of the world,,are not the only places,nor even the main places,in which manuscripts that could changenthe history of world culture,are in jeopardy.,Several years ago, I conductedna survey of European research libraries,and discovered that,nat the barest minimum,,there are 60,000 manuscripts,pre-1500,that are illegiblenbecause of water damage,,fading, mold and chemical reagents.,The real number is likely double that,,and that doesn't even count,Renaissance manuscriptsnand modern manuscripts,and cultural heritagenobjects such as maps. 
 What if there were a technology,that could recovernthese lost and unknown works?,Imagine worldwidenhow a trove of hundreds of thousands,of previously unknown texts,could radically transformnour knowledge of the past.,Imagine what unknown classicsnwe would discover,which would rewrite the canonsnof literature, history,,philosophy, music --,or, more provocatively, that couldnrewrite our cultural identities,,building new bridgesnbetween people and culture.,These are the questionsnthat transformed me,from a medieval scholar,na reader of texts,,into a textual scientist. 
 What an unsatisfying word "reader" is.,For me, it conjures upnimages of passivity,,of someone sitting idly in an armchair,waiting for knowledge to come to him,in a neat little parcel.,How much better to bena participant in the past,,an adventurer in an undiscovered country,,searching for the hidden text.,As an academic, I was a mere reader.,I read and taught the same classics,that people had been readingnand teaching for hundreds of years --,Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --,and with every scholarly articlenthat I published,I added to human knowledgenin ever-diminishing slivers of insight.,What I wanted to be,was an archaeologist of the past,,a discoverer of literature,,an Indiana Jones without the whip --,or, actually, with the whip. 
 (Laughter),And I wanted it not just for myselfnbut I wanted it for my students as well. 
 And so six years ago,nI changed the direction of my career.,At the time, I was workingnon "The Chess of Love,",the last important long poemnof the European Middle Ages,never to have been edited.,And it wasn't edited becausenit existed in only one manuscript,which was so badly damagednduring the firebombing of Dresden,in World War II,that generations of scholarsnhad pronounced it lost.,For five years, I had been workingnwith an ultraviolet lamp,trying to recover traces of the writing,and I'd gone about as farnas technology at the time,could actually take me. 
 And so I did what many people do.,I went online,,and there I learned about,how multispectral imaging had been usednto recover two lost treatises,of the famed Greeknmathematician Archimedes,from a 13th-century palimpsest.,A palimpsest is a manuscriptnwhich has been erased and overwritten. 
 And so, out of the blue,,I decided to writento the lead imaging scientist,on the Archimedes palimpsest project,,Professor Roger Easton,,with a plan and a plea.,And to my surprise,nhe actually wrote back.,With his help, I was ablento win a grant from the US government,to build a transportable,nmultispectral imaging lab,,And with this lab, I transformednwhat was a charred and faded mess,into a new medieval classic. 
 So how does multispectralnimaging actually work?,Well, the ideanbehind multispectral imaging,is something that anyone who is familiarnwith infrared night vision goggles,will immediately appreciate:,that what we can seenin the visible spectrum of light,is only a tiny fractionnof what's actually there.,The same is true with invisible writing.,Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light,between the ultraviolet and the infrared,,and these are shown downnonto the manuscript from above,from banks of LEDs,,and another multispectral light source,which comes up throughnthe individual leaves of the manuscript.,Up to 35 images per sequencenper leaf are imaged this way,using a high-powered digital cameranequipped with a lens,which is made out of quartz.,There are about fivenof these in the world.,And once we capture these images,,we feed them throughnstatistical algorithms,to further enhance and clarify them,,using software which was originallyndesigned for satellite images,and used by peoplenlike geospatial scientists,and the CIA. 
 The results can be spectacular.,You may already have heardnof what's been done,for the Dead Sea Scrolls,,which are slowly gelatinizing.,Using infrared, we've been ablento read even the darkest corners,of the Dead Sea Scrolls.,You may not be aware, however,,of other Biblical textsnthat are in jeopardy. 
 Here, for example,nis a leaf from a manuscript,that we imaged,,which is perhaps the most valuablenChristian Bible in the world.,The Codex Vercellensis is the oldestntranslation of the Gospels into Latin,,and it dates from the first halfnof the fourth century.,This is the closest we can come,to the Bible at the timenof the foundation of Christendom,under Emperor Constantine,,and at the time alsonof the Council of Nicaea,,when the basic creed of Christianitynwas being agreed upon.,This manuscript, unfortunately,nhas been very badly damaged,,and it's damaged because for centuries,it had been used and handled,in swearing in ceremonies in the church.,In fact, that purple splotchnthat you see in the upper left hand corner,is Aspergillus, which is a fungus,which originates in the unwashed hands,of a person with tuberculosis.,Our imaging has enabled mento make the first transcription,of this manuscript in 250 years. 
 Having a lab that can travelnto collections where it's needed, however,,is only part of the solution.,The technology is expensive and very rare,,and the imaging and imagenprocessing skills are esoteric.,That means that mounting recoveries,is beyond the reach of most researchersnand all but the wealthiest institutions.,That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,,a not-for-profit initiative,to bring multispectral imagingnto individual researchers,and smaller institutionsnat little or no cost whatsoever.,Over the past five years,,our team of imaging scientists,nscholars and students,has travelled to seven different countries,and have recovered some of the world'snmost valuable damaged manuscripts,,included the Vercelli Book,nwhich is the oldest book of English,,the Black Book of Carmarthen,nthe oldest book of Welsh,,and some of the most valuablenearliest Gospels,located in what is nownthe former Soviet Georgia. 
 So, spectral imagingncan recover lost texts.,More subtly, though, it can recoverna second story behind every object,,the story of how, whennand by whom a text was created,,and, sometimes, what the authornwas thinking at the time he wrote.,Take, for example, a draftnof the Declaration of Independence,written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,,which some colleagues of minenimaged a few years ago,at the Library of Congress.,Curators had noticednthat one word throughout,had been scratched out and overwritten.,The word overwritten was "citizens.",Perhaps you can guessnwhat the word underneath was.,"Subjects.",There, ladies and gentlemen,nis American democracy,evolving under the handnof Thomas Jefferson. 
 Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,,which we imagednat Yale's Beinecke Library.,This was the mapnthat Columbus likely consulted,before he traveled to the New World,and which gave him his ideanof what Asia looked like,and where Japan was located.,The problem with this mapnis that its inks and pigments,had so degraded over time,that this large, nearly seven-foot map,,made the world look like a giant desert.,Until now, we had very little idea,ndetailed idea, that is,,of what Columbus knew of the world,and how world cultures were represented.,The main legend of the mapnwas entirely illegible under normal light.,Ultraviolet did very little for it.,Multispectral gave us everything.,In Asia, we learned of monstersnwith ears so long,that they could covernthe creature's entire body.,In Africa, about a snakenwho could cause the ground to smoke.,Like starlight, which can convey images,of the way the Universenlooked in the distant past,,so multispectral light can take us backnto the first stuttering moments,of an object's creation.,Through this lens, we witnessnthe mistakes, the changes of mind,,the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,,the imperfections of the human imagination,that allow these hallowed objectsnand their authors,to become more real,,that make history closer to us. 
 What about the future?,There's so much of the past,,and so few peoplenwith the skills to rescue it,before these objects disappear forever.,That's why I have begun to teachnthis new hybrid discipline,that I call "textual science.",Textual science is a marriage,of the traditional skillsnof a literary scholar --,the ability to read old languagesnand old handwriting,,the knowledge of how texts are made,in order to be ablento place and date them --,with new techniques like imaging science,,the chemistry of inks and pigments,,computer-aided opticalncharacter recognition. 
 Last year, a student in my class,,a freshman,,with a background in Latin and Greek,,was image-processing a palimpsest,that we had photographednat a famous library in Rome.,As he worked, tiny Greek writingnbegan to appear from behind the text.,Everyone gathered around,,and he read a line from a lost work,of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.,This was the first timenin well over a thousand years,that those wordsnhad been pronounced aloud.,In that moment, he became a scholar. 
 Ladies and gentlemen,nthat is the future of the past. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So what if I could make for you,a designer baby?,What if you as a parent-to-be,and I as a scientist decidednto go down that road together? 
 What if we didn't?,What if we thought, "That's a bad idea,",but many of our family,nfriends and coworkers,did make that decision? 
 Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.,Let's pretend it's the year 2030,,and you're a parent.,You have your daughter,nMarianne, next to you,,and in 2030, she is what we call a natural,because she has no genetic modifications.,And because you and your partnernconsciously made that decision,,many in your social circle,nthey kind of look down on you.,They think you're, like,na Luddite or a technophobe. 
 Marianne's best friend Jenna,nwho lives right next door,,is a very different story.,She was born a genetically modifiedndesigner baby with numerous upgrades.,Yeah. Upgrades.,And these enhancements were introduced,using a new geneticnmodification technology,that goes by the funny name CRISPR,,you know, like something's crisp,,this is CRISPR.,The scientist that Jenna's parentsnhired to do this,for several million dollars,introduced CRISPRninto a whole panel of human embryos.,And then they used genetic testing,,and they predicted thatnthat little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,,would be the best of the bunch.,And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.,She's sitting on the carpetnin your living room,playing with your daughter Marianne.,And your families have knownneach other for years now,,and it's become very clear to you,that Jenna is extraordinary.,She's incredibly intelligent.,If you're honest with yourself,nshe's smarter than you,,and she's five years old.,She's beautiful, tall, athletic,,and the list goes on and on.,And in fact, there'sna whole new generation,of these GM kids like Jenna.,And so far it looks like,they're healthiernthan their parents' generation,,than your generation.,And they have lower health care costs.,They're immune to a hostnof health conditions,,including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases. 
 It all sounds so great,,but you can't help but haventhis sort of unsettling feeling,,a gut feeling, that there's somethingnjust not quite right about Jenna,,and you've had the same feelingnabout other GM kids that you've met.,You were also readingnin the newspaper earlier this week,that a study of these childrennwho were born as designer babies,indicates they may have some issues,,like increased aggressivenessnand narcissism.,But more immediately on your mind,is some news that you just gotnfrom Jenna's family.,She's so smart,,she's now going to be goingnto a special school,,a different schoolnthan your daughter Marianne,,and this is kind of throwingnyour family into a disarray.,Marianne's been crying,,and last night when you took her to bednto kiss her goodnight,,she said, "Daddy, will Jennaneven be my friend anymore?" 
 So now, as I've been telling younthis imagined 2030 story,,I have a feelingnthat I may have put some of you,into this sci-finframe of reference. Right?,You think you're reading a sci-fi book.,Or maybe, like,nin Halloween mode of thinking.,But this is reallyna possible reality for us,,just 15 years from now. 
 I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher,and I can see this new CRISPR technology,and its potential impact.,And we may find ourselves in that reality,,and a lot will dependnon what we decide to do today.,And if you're stillnkind of thinking in sci-fi mode,,consider that the world of sciencenhad a huge shock earlier this year,,and the public largelyndoesn't even know about it.,Researchers in China just a few months ago,reported the creationnof genetically modified human embryos.,This was the first time in history.,And they did it usingnthis new CRISPR technology.,It didn't work perfectly,,but I still thinknthey sort of cracked the door ajar,on a Pandora's box here.,And I think some peoplenare going to run with this technology,and try to make designer babies. 
 Now, before I go on, some of younmay hold up your hands and say,,"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.,Wouldn't that be illegal?,You can't just go offnand create a designer baby.",And in fact, to some extent, you're right.,In some countries, you couldn't do that.,But in many other countries,nincluding my country, the US,,there's actually no law on this,nso in theory, you could do it.,And there was another developmentnthis year that resonates in this area,,and that happenednnot so far from here over in the UK.,And the UK traditionallynhas been the strictest country,when it comes to humanngenetic modification.,It was illegal there,,but just a few months ago,,they carved out an exception to that rule.,They passed a new law,allowing the creationnof genetically modified humans,with the noble goal of tryingnto prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.,But still I think in combinationnthese events are pushing us,further towards an acceptance,of human genetic modification. 
 So I've been talkingnabout this CRISPR technology.,What actually is CRISPR?,So if you think about the GMOsnthat we're all more familiar with,,like GMO tomatoes and wheat,and things like that,,this technologynis similar to the technologies,that were used to make those,,but it's dramatically better,,cheaper and faster. 
 So what is it?,It's actually likena genetic Swiss army knife.,We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife,with different tools in it,,and one of the toolsnis kind of like a magnifying glass,or a GPS for our DNA,,so it can home in on a certain spot.,And the next tool is like scissors,that can cut the DNA right in that spot.,And finally we have a pen,where we can literally rewritenthe genetic code in that location.,It's really that simple. 
 And this technology, which camenon the scene just three years ago,,has taken science by storm.,It's evolving so fast, and it'snso freaking exciting to scientists,,and I admit I'm fascinated by itnand we use it in my own lab,,that I think someonenis going to go that extra step,and continue the GM human embryo work,and maybe make designer babies.,This is so ubiquitous now.,It just came on the scene three years ago.,Thousands of labsnliterally have this in hand today,,and they're doing important research.,Most of them are not interestednin designer babies.,They're studying human disease,and other important elements of science.,So there's a lot of good researchngoing on with CRISPR.,And the fact that we cannnow do genetic modifications,that used to take yearsnand cost millions of dollars,in a few weeksnfor a couple thousand bucks,,to me as a scientist that's fantastic,,but again, at the same time,,it opens the door to people going too far.,And I think for some people,the focus is not going to benso much on science.,That's not what's goingnto be driving them.,It's going to be ideologynor the chase for a profit.,And they're going to gonfor designer babies. 
 So why should we be concerned about this?,We know from Darwin,nif we go back two centuries,,that evolution and geneticsnprofoundly have impacted humanity,,who we are today.,And some think there's likena social Darwinism at work in our world,,and maybe even a eugenics as well.,Imagine those trends, those forces,,with a booster rocketnof this CRISPR technology,that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.,And in fact, we can just go backnone century to the last century,to see the power that eugenics can have. 
 So my father, Peter Knoepfler,,was actually born right here in Vienna.,He was Viennese,nand he was born here in 1929.,And when my grandparentsnhad little baby Peter,,the world was very different. Right?,It was a different Vienna.,The United States was different.,The world was different.,There was a eugenics rising,,and my grandparents realized,,pretty quickly I think,,that they were on the wrong sidenof the eugenics equation.,And so despite this being their home,and their whole extended family's home,,and this area being their family'snhome for generations,,they decided because of eugenics,that they had to leave.,And they survived,nbut they were heartbroken,,and I'm not sure my dadnever really got over leaving Vienna.,He left when he was just eight years old,in 1938. 
 So today, I see a new eugenics,kind of bubbling to the surface.,It's supposed to be a kinder,ngentler, positive eugenics,,different than all that past stuff.,But I think even though it's focusednon trying to improve people,,it could have negative consequences,,and it really worries me,that some of the top proponentsnof this new eugenics,,they think CRISPR is the ticketnto make it happen. 
 So I have to admit, you know,,eugenics, we talknabout making better people.,It's a tough question.,What is better when we're talkingnabout a human being?,But I admit I think maybe a lot of us,could agree that human beings,,maybe we could use a little betterment.,Look at our politicians,here, you know, back in the US --,God forbid we go there right now.,Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,,there might be waysnwe think we could be better.,I might wish, honestly, that I hadnmore hair here, instead of baldness.,Some people might wish they were taller,,have a different weight, a different face.,If we could do those things,nwe could make those things happen,,or we could make them happennin our children,,it would be very seductive.,And yet coming with itnwould be these risks.,I talked about eugenics,,but there would be risksnto individuals as well.,So if we forget about enhancing people,and we just try to make themnhealthier using genetic modification,,this technology is so new,and so powerful,,that by accidentnwe could make them sicker.,That easily could happen.,And there's another risk,,and that is that all of the legitimate,nimportant genetic modification research,going on just in the lab --,again, no interest in designer babies --,a few people goingnthe designer baby route,,things go badly,,that entire field could be damaged. 
 I also think it's not that unlikely,that governments might start takingnan interest in genetic modification.,So for example our imagined GM Jenna child,who is healthier,,if there's a generation that looksnlike they have lower health care costs,,it's possible that governmentsnmay start trying to compel their citizens,to go the GM route.,Look at China's one-child policy.,It's thought that that preventednthe birth of 400 million human beings.,So it's not beyond the realm of possible,that genetic modificationncould be something that governments push.,And if designer babies become popular,,in our digital age --,viral videos, social media --,what if designer babiesnare thought to be fashionable,,and they kind of becomenthe new glitterati,,the new Kardashians or something? 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, are those trendsnthat we really could control?,I'm not convinced that we could. 
 So again, today it's Halloween,and when we talknabout genetic modification,,there's one Halloween-associated character,that is talked aboutnor invoked more than anything else,,and that is Frankenstein.,Mostly that's been Frankenfoodsnand all this other stuff.,But if we think about this nownand we think about it in the human context,on a day like Halloween,,if parents can in essencencostume their children genetically,,are we going to be talking aboutna Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?,I don't think so. I don't thinknit's going to get to that extreme.,But when we are going aboutnhacking the human code,,I think all bets are offnin terms of what might come of that.,There would still be dangers.,And we can look in the past,to other elementsnof transformative science,and see how they cannbasically go out of control,and permeate society. 
 So I'll just give you one example,nand that is in vitro fertilization.,Almost exactly 40 years ago,,test tube baby number onenLouise Brown was born,,and that's a great thing,,and I think since thennfive million IVF babies have been born,,bringing immeasurable happiness.,A lot of parents now can love those kids.,But if you think about it,nin four decades,,five million babies being bornnfrom a new technology,is pretty remarkable,,and the same kind of thing could happen,with human genetic modificationnand designer babies.,So depending on the decisionsnwe make in the next few months,,the next year or so,,if designer baby number one is born,,within a few decades,,there could well be millionsnof genetically modified humans.,And there's a difference there too,nbecause if we, you in the audience, or I,,if we decide to have a designer baby,,then their children will alsonbe genetically modified, and so on,,because it's heritable.,So that's a big difference. 
 So with all of this in mind,,what should we do?,There's actually going to be a meeting,a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.,by the US National Academy of Sciences,to tackle that exact question.,What is the right path forwardnwith human genetic modification?,I believe at this time,we need a moratorium.,We have to ban this.,We should not allowncreating genetically modified people,,because it's just too dangerousnand too unpredictable.,But there's a lot of people -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 And let me say, just as a scientist,,it's a little bit scarynfor me to say that in public,,because science generally doesn't likenself-regulation and things like that.,So I think we need to put a hold on this,,but there are many peoplenwho not only disagree with me,,they feel the exact opposite.,They're like, step on the gas,nfull speed ahead,,let's make designer babies.,And so in the meeting in December,and other meetings that are likelynto follow in the next few months,,it's very possiblenthere may be no moratorium.,And I think partnof the problem that we have,is that all of this trend,,this revolution in genetic modificationnapplying to humans,,the public hasn't known about it.,Nobody has been saying,,look, this is a big deal,nthis is a revolution,,and this could affect younin very personal ways.,And so part of my goalnis actually to change that,and to educate and engage with the public,and get you guys talking about this.,And so I hope at these meetingsnthat there will be a role for the public,to bring their voice to bear as well. 
 So if we kind of circle back nownto 2030 again, that imagined story,,and depending on the decisionsnwe make, again, today --,literally we don't have a lot of time --,in the next few months,nthe next year or so,,because this technologynis spreading like wildfire.,Let's pretend we're back in that reality.,We're at a park,,and our kid is swinging on the swing.,Is that kid a regular old kid,,or did we decide to have a designer baby?,And let's say we wentnthe sort of traditional route,,and there's our kid swinging on the swing,,and frankly, they're kind of a mess.,Their hair is all overnthe place like mine.,They have a stuffy nose.,They're not the best student in the world.,They're adorable, you love them,,but there on the swing next to them,,their best friend is a GM kid,,and the two of themnare kind of swinging like this,,and you can't helpnbut compare them, right?,And the GM kid is swinging higher,,they look better,nthey're a better student,,they don't have that stuffy nosenyou need to wipe.,How is that going to make you feel,and what decisionnmight you make next time? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You know, I didn't set outnto be a parenting expert.,In fact, I'm not very interestednin parenting, per Se.,It's just that there's a certain stylenof parenting these days,that is kind of messing up kids,,impeding their chancesnto develop into theirselves.,There's a certain stylenof parenting these days,that's getting in the way. 
 I guess what I'm saying is,,we spend a lot of timenbeing very concerned,about parents who aren't involved enoughnin the lives of their kids,and their education or their upbringing,,and rightly so.,But at the other end of the spectrum,,there's a lot of harmngoing on there as well,,where parents feelna kid can't be successful,unless the parent is protectingnand preventing at every turn,and hovering over every happening,nand micromanaging every moment,,and steering their kid towardsnsome small subset of colleges and careers. 
 When we raise kids this way,,and I'll say we,,because Lord knows,nin raising my two teenagers,,I've had these tendencies myself,,our kids end up leadingna kind of checklisted childhood. 
 And here's what the checklistednchildhood looks like.,We keep them safe and sound,and fed and watered,,and then we want to be surenthey go to the right schools,,that they're in the right classesnat the right schools,,and that they get the right gradesnin the right classes in the right schools.,But not just the grades, the scores,,and not just the grades and scores,nbut the accolades and the awards,and the sports,nthe activities, the leadership.,We tell our kids, don't just join a club,,start a club, because collegesnwant to see that.,And check the box for community service.,I mean, show the collegesnyou care about others. 
 (Laughter) 
 And all of this is done to somenhoped-for degree of perfection.,We expect our kidsnto perform at a level of perfection,we were never askednto perform at ourselves,,and so because so much is required,,we think,,well then, of course we parentsnhave to argue with every teacher,and principal and coach and referee,and act like our kid's concierge,and personal handler,and secretary. 
 And then with our kids, our precious kids,,we spend so much time nudging,,cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,nnagging as the case may be,,to be sure they're not screwing up,,not closing doors,,not ruining their future,,some hoped-for admission,to a tiny handful of colleges,that deny almost every applicant. 
 And here's what it feels likento be a kid in this checklisted childhood.,First of all, there'snno time for free play.,There's no room in the afternoons,,because everythingnhas to be enriching, we think.,It's as if every piece of homework,nevery quiz, every activity,is a make-or-break momentnfor this future we have in mind for them,,and we absolve themnof helping out around the house,,and we even absolve themnof getting enough sleep,as long as they're checking offnthe items on their checklist.,And in the checklisted childhood,nwe say we just want them to be happy,,but when they come home from school,,what we ask about all too often first,is their homework and their grades.,And they see in our faces,that our approval, that our love,,that their very worth,,comes from A's.,And then we walk alongside them,and offer clucking praise like a trainernat the Westminster Dog Show -- 
 (Laughter) 
 coaxing them to just jump a little highernand soar a little farther,,day after day after day.,And when they get to high school,,they don't say, "Well, what might Inbe interested in studying,or doing as an activity?",They go to counselors and they say,,"What do I need to donto get into the right college?",And then, when the gradesnstart to roll in in high school,,and they're getting some B's,,or God forbid some C's,,they frantically text their friends,and say, "Has anyone ever gottenninto the right college with these grades?" 
 And our kids,,regardless of where they end upnat the end of high school,,they're breathless.,They're brittle.,They're a little burned out.,They're a little old before their time,,wishing the grown-ups in their livesnhad said, "What you've done is enough,,this effort you've put forthnin childhood is enough.",And they're withering nownunder high rates of anxiety and depression,and some of them are wondering,,will this life ever turn outnto have been worth it? 
 Well, we parents,,we parents are pretty surenit's all worth it.,We seem to behave --,it's like we literally thinknthey will have no future,if they don't get into one of thesentiny set of colleges or careers,we have in mind for them. 
 Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid,they won't have a future we can brag about,to our friends and with stickersnon the backs of our cars.,Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 But if you look at what we've done,,if you have the couragento really look at it,,you'll see that not only do our kidsnthink their worth comes,from grades and scores,,but that when we live right up insidentheir precious developing minds,all the time, like our very own versionnof the movie "Being John Malkovich,",we send our children the message:,"Hey kid, I don't think you can actuallynachieve any of this without me.",And so with our overhelp,,our overprotectionnand overdirection and hand-holding,,we deprive our kidsnof the chance to build self-efficacy,,which is a really fundamental tenetnof the human psyche,,far more importantnthan that self-esteem they get,every time we applaud.,Self-efficacy is built when one seesnthat one's own actions lead to outcomes,,not --,There you go. 
 (Applause) 
 Not one's parents'nactions on one's behalf,,but when one's own actionsnlead to outcomes.,So simply put,,if our children are to developnself-efficacy, and they must,,then they have to do a whole lot morenof the thinking, planning, deciding,,doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,,dreaming and experiencing of life,for themselves. 
 Now, am I saying,every kid is hard-working and motivated,and doesn't need a parent's involvementnor interest in their lives,,and we should just back off and let go?,Hell no. 
 (Laughter) 
 That is not what I'm saying.,What I'm saying is, when we treatngrades and scores and accolades and awards,as the purpose of childhood,,all in furtherance of some hoped-fornadmission to a tiny number of colleges,or entrance to a small number of careers,,that that's too narrow a definitionnof success for our kids.,And even though we might help themnachieve some short-term wins,by overhelping --,like they get a better gradenif we help them do their homework,,they might end up with a longernchildhood résumé when we help --,what I'm saying is that all of thisncomes at a long-term cost,to their sense of self.,What I'm saying is,nwe should be less concerned,with the specific set of colleges,they might be ablento apply to or might get into,and far more concerned that they haventhe habits, the mindset, the skill set,,the wellness, to be successfulnwherever they go.,What I'm saying is,,our kids need us to be a littlenless obsessed with grades and scores,and a whole lot more interested,in childhood providingna foundation for their success,built on things like love,and chores. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Did I just say chores?nDid I just say chores? I really did.,But really, here's why.,The longest longitudinal studynof humans ever conducted,is called the Harvard Grant Study.,It found that professionalnsuccess in life,,which is what we want for our kids,,that professional success in lifencomes from having done chores as a kid,,and the earlier you started, the better,,that a roll-up-your-sleeves-nand-pitch-in mindset,,a mindset that says,nthere's some unpleasant work,,someone's got to do it,nit might as well be me,,a mindset that says,,I will contribute my effortnto the betterment of the whole,,that that's what gets you aheadnin the workplace.,Now, we all know this. You know this. 
 (Applause) 
 We all know this, and yet,nin the checklisted childhood,,we absolve our kids of doingnthe work of chores around the house,,and then they end upnas young adults in the workplace,still waiting for a checklist,,but it doesn't exist,,and more importantly,nlacking the impulse, the instinct,to roll up their sleeves and pitch in,and look around and wonder,nhow can I be useful to my colleagues?,How can I anticipate a few steps aheadnto what my boss might need? 
 A second very important findingnfrom the Harvard Grant Study,said that happiness in life,comes from love,,not love of work,,love of humans:,our spouse, our partner,nour friends, our family.,So childhood needs to teachnour kids how to love,,and they can't love othersnif they don't first love themselves,,and they won't love themselvesnif we can't offer them unconditional love. 
 (Applause) 
 Right.,And so,,instead of being obsessednwith grades and scores,when our precious offspringncome home from school,,or we come home from work,,we need to close our technology,nput away our phones,,and look them in the eye,and let them seenthe joy that fills our faces,when we see our childnfor the first time in a few hours.,And then we have to say,,"How was your day?,What did you like about today?",And when your teenage daughternsays, "Lunch," like mine did,,and I want to hear about the math test,,not lunch,,you have to stillntake an interest in lunch.,You gotta say, "What was greatnabout lunch today?",They need to knownthey matter to us as humans,,not because of their GPA. 
 All right, so you're thinking,nchores and love,,that sounds all well and good,nbut give me a break.,The colleges want to seentop scores and grades,and accolades and awards,nand I'm going to tell you, sort of.,The very biggest brand-name schoolsnare asking that of our young adults,,but here's the good news.,Contrary to what the collegenrankings racket would have us believe -- 
 (Applause) 
 you don't have to go to onenof the biggest brand name schools,to be happy and successful in life.,Happy and successful peoplenwent to state school,,went to a small collegenno one has heard of,,went to community college,,went to a college over herenand flunked out. 
 (Applause) 
 The evidence is in this room,nis in our communities,,that this is the truth.,And if we could widen our blinders,and be willing to looknat a few more colleges,,maybe remove our own egosnfrom the equation,,we could accept and embracenthis truth and then realize,,it is hardly the end of the world,if our kids don't go to onenof those big brand-name schools.,And more importantly,,if their childhood has not been livednaccording to a tyrannical checklist,then when they get to college,,whichever one it is,,well, they'll have gone therenon their own volition,,fueled by their own desire,,capable and ready to thrive there. 
 I have to admit something to you.,I've got two kids I mentioned,nSawyer and Avery.,They're teenagers.,And once upon a time,,I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery,like little bonsai trees -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that I was goingnto carefully clip and prune,and shape into some perfectnform of a human,that might just be perfect enoughnto warrant them admission,to one of the mostnhighly selective colleges.,But I've come to realize, after workingnwith thousands of other people's kids -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and raising two kids of my own,,my kids aren't bonsai trees.,They're wildflowers,of an unknown genus and species -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and it's my job to providena nourishing environment,,to strengthen them through chores,and to love them so they cannlove others and receive love,and the college, the major, the career,,that's up to them.,My job is not to make them becomenwhat I would have them become,,but to support themnin becoming their glorious selves. 
 Thank you.

 Michael Pemberton. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you.So, my journey begannin the Bronx, New York,,in a one-bedroom apartment,,with my two sisters and immigrant mother.,I loved our neighborhood.,It was lively.,There was all this merengue blasting,,neighbors socializing on building stoops,and animated conversationsnover domino playing.,It was home,,and it was sweet.,But it wasn't simple.,In fact, everyone at schoolnknew the block where we lived,,because it was where people camento buy weed and other drugs.,And with drug-dealing comes conflict,,so we often went to sleepnto the sound of gunshots. 
 I spent much of my childhood worried,,worried about our safety.,And so did our mother.,She worried that the violence we witnessednwould overtake our lives;,that our poverty meant,that the neighbors with whomnwe lived and shared space,would harm us.,Our entire life was in the Bronx,,but my mother's anxietynspurred her into action,,and soon we were drivingnso fast to Connecticut -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to boarding school campuses,nwith full scholarships in tow.,Man, don't underestimatenthe power of a mother,determined to keep her children safe. 
 (Cheers),(Applause) 
 At boarding school,,for the first time,,I was able to sleep without worry.,I could leave my dorm room unlocked,,walk barefoot in the grass,,and look up to seena night sky full of stars.,Happy novelties. 
 But there were other novelties as well.,Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.,I learned that I didn't speaknthe right way,,and to demonstratenthe proper ways of speaking,,my teachers gave menfrequent lessons, in public,,on the appropriate waynto enunciate certain words. 
 A teacher once instructed menin the hallway:,"Aaaaaas-king.",She said this loudly.,"Dena, it's not 'axing,'nlike you're running around with an axe.,That's silly." 
 Now at this point, you can imaginenthe snickers of my classmates,,but she continued:,"Think about breaking the wordninto 'ass' and 'king,',and then put the two togethernto say it correctly --,'Asking.'" 
 There were some other momentsnthat reminded me that I didn't belong.,Once, I walked intona classmate's dorm room,,and I watched her watchnher valuables around me.,Like, why would she do that?nI thought to myself.,And then there was the time,when another classmatenwalked into my dorm room,,and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applyingnhair grease to my scalp. 
 There is emotional damage donenwhen young people can't be themselves,,when they are forced to edit who they arenin order to be acceptable.,It's a kind of violence. 
 Ultimately, I'm a quintessentialnsuccess story.,I attended boarding schoolnand college in New England,,studied abroad in Chile,and returned to the Bronxnto be a middle school teacher.,I received a Truman Scholarship,,a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.,And I could list more. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I won't. 
 (Laughter) 
 I earned my doctoratenat Columbia University. 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 And then I landed a job at Yale. 
 (Applause) 
 I am proud of everythingnthat I've been able to accomplish,on my journey thus far. 
 I have eternal imposter syndrome.,Either I've been invitednbecause I'm a token,,which really isn't about me,,but rather, about a boxnsomeone needed to check off.,Or, I am exceptional,,which means I've had to leaventhe people I love behind.,It's the price that I and so many othersnpay for learning while black. 
 (Applause) 
 I police myself all the time.,Are my pants too tight?,Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?,Should I speak up for myself,,or will the power of my wordsnbe reduced to: "She's angry"? 
 Why did I have to leave the Bronx,to gain access to a better education?,And why, in the processnof getting that better education,,did I have to endure the traumanof erasing what made me, me --,a black girl from the Bronx,nraised by an Antiguan mother?,So when I think about our currentneducation reform initiatives,,I can't help asking:,What are our students of colornlearning about themselves? 
 Three -- three decades of research reveal,that students of colornare suspended and expelled,at a rate three times greaternthan white students,,and are punished in harsher waysnfor the same infractions.,They also learn this through the absencenof their lives and narratives,in the curricula.,The Cooperative Children's Book Centerndid a review of nearly 4,000 books,and found that only three percentnwere about African-Americans.,And they further learn this,through the lack of teachersnthat look like them.,An analysis of data,from the National Centernfor Education Statistics,found that 45 percent of our nation'snpre-K to high school students,were people of color,,while only 17 percent of our teachers are. 
 Our youth of color pay a profound price,when their schoolingnsends them the message,that they must be controlled,,that they must leaventheir identities at home,in order to be successful.,Every child deserves an education,that guarantees the safety to learn,in the comfort of one's own skin. 
 (Applause) 
 It is possible to create emotionallynand physically safe classrooms,where students also thrive academically.,I know, because I did it in my classroom,when I returned to teach in the Bronx. 
 So what did that look like?,I centered my instruction,on the lives, historiesnand identities of my students.,And I did all of thisnbecause I wanted my students to know,that everyone around themnwas supporting them,to be their best self.,So while I could not controlnthe instability of their homes,,the uncertainty of their next meal,,or the loud neighborsnthat kept them from sleep,,I provided them with a loving classroom,that made them feel proud of who they are,,that made them know that they mattered. 
 You know,,every time I hearnor say the word "asking,",I am in high school again.,I am thinking about "ass" and "king",and putting the two togethernso that I speak in a way,where someone in powernwill want to listen. 
 There is a better way,,one that doesn't force kids of colorninto a double bind;,a way for them to preserve their ties,to their families, homes and communities;,a way that teaches themnto trust their instincts,and to have faithnin their own creative genius. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I opened Mott HallnBridges Academy in 2010,,my goal was simple:,open a school to close a prison.,Now to some, this was an audacious goal,,because our school is locatednin the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --,one of the most underservednand violent neighborhoods,in all of New York City.,Like many urban schoolsnwith high poverty rates,,we face numerous challenges,,like finding teachers who can empathize,with the complexitiesnof a disadvantaged community,,lack of funding for technology,,low parental involvement,and neighborhood gangs that recruitnchildren as early as fourth grade. 
 So here I was,,the founding principal of a middle schoolnthat was a district public school,,and I only had 45 kids to start.,Thirty percent of them had special needs.,Eighty-six percent of themnwere below grade level,in English and in math.,And 100 percent were livingnbelow the poverty level. 
 If our children are not in our classrooms,,how will they learn?,And if they're not learning,,where would they end up? 
 It was evident when I wouldnask my 13-year-old,,"Young man,,where do you see yourself in five years?" 
 And his response:,"I don't know if I'm gonnanlive that long." 
 Or to have a young woman say to me,that she had a lifelong goalnof working in a fast-food restaurant.,To me, this was unacceptable.,It was also evident that they had no idea,that there was a landscape of opportunity,that existed beyond their neighborhood. 
 We call our students "scholars,"nbecause they're lifelong learners.,And the skills that they learn today,will prepare them for collegenand career readiness.,I chose the royal colorsnof purple and black,,because I want them to be remindednthat they are descendants of greatness,,and that through education,,they are future engineers,,scientists,,entrepreneurs,and even leaders who can and willntake over this world.,To date,,we have had three graduating classes,,at a 98 -- 
 (Applause) 
 At a 98-percent graduation rate.,This is nearly 200 children,,who are now going to some of the mostncompetitive high schools,in New York City. 
 (Applause) 
 It was a cold day in January,when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet,nmet Brandon Stanton,,the founder of the popular blogn"Humans of New York.",Brandon shared the storynof a young man from Brownsville,who had witnessed violence firsthand,,by witnessing a mannbeing thrown off of a roof.,Yet he can stillnbe influenced by a principal,who had opened up a schoolnthat believes in all children.,Vidal embodies the story of so manynof our underprivileged children,who are struggling to survive,,which is why we mustnmake education a priority. 
 Brandon's post created a global sensation,that touched the lives of millions.,This resulted in 1.4 millionndollars being raised,for our scholars to attend field tripsnto colleges and universities,,Summer STEAM programs,,as well as college scholarships.,You need to understand,that when 200 young peoplenfrom Brownsville visited Harvard,,they now understood,that a college of their choicenwas a real possibility.,And the impossibilitiesnthat had been imposed upon them,by a disadvantaged community,were replaced by hope and purpose. 
 The revolution in educationnis happening in our schools,,with adults who provide love,,structure,,support,and knowledge.,These are the thingsnthat inspire children.,But it is not an easy task.,And there are high demands,within an education systemnthat is not perfect. 
 But I have a dynamic group of educators,who collaborate as a team to determinenwhat is the best curriculum.,They take time beyond their school day,,and come in on weekends,and even use their own moneynto often provide resources,when we do not have it.,And as the principal,,I have to inspect what I expect. 
 So I show up in classes,and I conduct observationsnto give feedback,,because I want my teachersnto be just as successful,as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.,And I give them access to menevery single day,,which is why they all havenmy personal cell number,,including my scholarsnand those who graduated --,which is probably why I getnphone calls and text messages,at three o'clock in the morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we are all connected to succeed,,and good leaders do this.,Tomorrow's future is sittingnin our classrooms.,And they are our responsibility.,That means everyone in here,,and those who are watching the screen.,We must believe in their brilliance,,and remind them by teaching them,that there indeed is power in education. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here today to talk aboutnthe two ideas that,,at least based onnmy observations at Khan Academy,,are kind of the core,nor the key leverage points for learning.,And it's the idea of mastery,and the idea of mindset. 
 I saw this in the early daysnworking with my cousins.,A lot of them were having troublenwith math at first,,because they had all of these gapsnaccumulated in their learning.,And because of that, at some pointnthey got to an algebra class,and they might have been a little bitnshaky on some of the pre-algebra,,and because of that, they thoughtnthey didn't have the math gene.,Or they'd get to a calculus class,,and they'd be a little bitnshaky on the algebra.,I saw it in the early days,when I was uploadingnsome of those videos on YouTube,,and I realized that peoplenwho were not my cousins were watching. 
 (Laughter) 
 And at first, those commentsnwere just simple thank-yous.,I thought that was a pretty big deal.,I don't know how much timenyou all spend on YouTube.,Most of the comments are not "Thank you." 
 (Laughter) 
 They're a little edgier than that.,But then the commentsngot a little more intense,,student after student sayingnthat they had grown up not liking math.,It was getting difficult as they gotninto more advanced math topics.,By the time they got to algebra,,they had so many gaps in their knowledgenthey couldn't engage with it.,They thought they didn'tnhave the math gene.,But when they were a bit older,,they took a little agencynand decided to engage.,They found resources like Khan Academy,and they were able to fill in those gapsnand master those concepts,,and that reinforced their mindsetnthat it wasn't fixed;,that they actually were capablenof learning mathematics. 
 And in a lot of ways, this is hownyou would master a lot of things in life.,It's the way you wouldnlearn a martial art.,In a martial art, you wouldnpractice the white belt skills,as long as necessary,,and only when you've mastered it,you would move on to become a yellow belt.,It's the way you learnna musical instrument:,you practice the basic piecenover and over again,,and only when you've mastered it,,you go on to the more advanced one. 
 But what we point out --,this is not the way a traditionalnacademic model is structured,,the type of academic modelnthat most of us grew up in.,In a traditional academic model,,we group students together,nusually by age,,and around middle school,,by age and perceived ability,,and we shepherd them allntogether at the same pace.,And what typically happens,,let's say we're in a middle schoolnpre-algebra class,,and the current unit is on exponents,,the teacher will givena lecture on exponents,,then we'll go home, do some homework.,The next morning,nwe'll review the homework,,then another lecture, homework,nlecture, homework.,That will continue for aboutntwo or three weeks,,and then we get a test.,On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,,maybe you get a 90 percent,,maybe you get a 95 percent.,And even though the test identifiedngaps in our knowledge,,I didn't know 25 percent of the material.,Even the A student, what wasnthe five percent they didn't know? 
 Even though we've identified the gaps,,the whole class will thennmove on to the next subject,,probably a more advanced subjectnthat's going to build on those gaps.,It might be logarithmsnor negative exponents.,And that process continues,nand you immediately start to realize,how strange this is.,I didn't know 25 percentnof the more foundational thing,,and now I'm being pushednto the more advanced thing.,And this will continue for months, years,nall the way until at some point,,I might be in an algebra classnor trigonometry class,and I hit a wall.,And it's not because algebranis fundamentally difficult,or because the student isn't bright.,It's because I'm seeing an equationnand they're dealing with exponents,and that 30 percentnthat I didn't know is showing up.,And then I start to disengage. 
 To appreciate how absurd that is,,imagine if we did other thingsnin our life that way.,Say, home-building. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we bring in the contractor and say,,"We were told we haventwo weeks to build a foundation.,Do what you can." 
 (Laughter) 
 So they do what they can.,Maybe it rains.,Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.,And two weeks later,nthe inspector comes, looks around,,says, "OK, the concretenis still wet right over there,,that part's not quite up to code ...,I'll give it an 80 percent." 
 (Laughter) 
 You say, "Great! That's a C.nLet's build the first floor." 
 (Laughter) 
 Same thing.,We have two weeks, do what you can,ninspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.,Great, that's a D-plus.,Second floor, third floor,,and all of a sudden,nwhile you're building the third floor,,the whole structure collapses.,And if your reaction is the reactionnyou typically have in education,,or that a lot of folks have,,you might say, maybenwe had a bad contractor,,or maybe we needed better inspectionnor more frequent inspection.,But what was really brokennwas the process.,We were artificially constrainingnhow long we had to something,,pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,,and we took the trouble of inspectingnand identifying those gaps,,but then we built right on top of it. 
 So the idea of mastery learningnis to do the exact opposite.,Instead of artificiallynconstraining, fixing,when and how long you work on something,,pretty much ensuringnthat variable outcome,,the A, B, C, D, F --,do it the other way around.,What's variable is when and how long,a student actually hasnto work on something,,and what's fixed is thatnthey actually master the material. 
 And it's important to realize,that not only will this make the studentnlearn their exponents better,,but it'll reinforcenthe right mindset muscles.,It makes them realize that if you gotn20 percent wrong on something,,it doesn't mean that you havena C branded in your DNA somehow.,It means that you should justnkeep working on it.,You should have grit;nyou should have perseverance;,you should take agency over your learning. 
 Now, a lot of skeptics might say,nwell, hey, this is all great,,philosophically, this whole ideanof mastery-based learning,and its connection to mindset,,students taking agencynover their learning.,It makes a lot of sense,nbut it seems impractical.,To actually do it, every studentnwould be on their own track.,It would have to be personalized,,you'd have to have private tutorsnand worksheets for every student.,And these aren't new ideas --,there were experimentsnin Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,,where they did mastery-based learningnand saw great results,,but they said it wouldn't scalenbecause it was logistically difficult.,The teacher had to give differentnworksheets to every student,,give on-demand assessments. 
 But now today, it's no longer impractical.,We have the tools to do it.,Students see an explanationnat their own time and pace?,There's on-demand video for that.,They need practice? They need feedback?,There's adaptive exercisesnreadily available for students. 
 And when that happens,nall sorts of neat things happen.,One, the students can actuallynmaster the concepts,,but they're also buildingntheir growth mindset,,they're building grit, perseverance,,they're taking agency over their learning.,And all sorts of beautiful thingsncan start to happen,in the actual classroom.,Instead of it being focusednon the lecture,,students can interact with each other.,They can get deeper masterynover the material.,They can go into simulations,nSocratic dialogue. 
 To appreciate what we're talking about,and the tragedy of lost potential here,,I'd like to give a little bitnof a thought experiment.,If we were to go 400 yearsninto the past to Western Europe,,which even then, was one of the morenliterate parts of the planet,,you would see that about 15 percentnof the population knew how to read.,And I suspect that if you asked someonenwho did know how to read,,say a member of the clergy,,"What percentage of the populationndo you think is even capable of reading?",They might say, "Well,nwith a great education system,,maybe 20 or 30 percent.",But if you fast forward to today,,we know that that predictionnwould have been wildly pessimistic,,that pretty close to 100 percentnof the population is capable of reading.,But if I were to ask youna similar question:,"What percentage of the populationndo you think is capable,of truly mastering calculus,,or understanding organic chemistry,,or being able to contributento cancer research?",A lot of you might say, "Well,nwith a great education system,,maybe 20, 30 percent." 
 But what if that estimate,is just based on your own experiencenin a non-mastery framework,,your own experience with yourselfnor observing your peers,,where you're being pushednat this set pace through classes,,accumulating all these gaps?,Even when you got that 95 percent,,what was that five percent you missed?,And it keeps accumulating --nyou get to an advanced class,,all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,,"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;,not meant to be a physicist;nnot meant to be a mathematician.",I suspect that that actually is the case,,but if you were allowed to be operatingnin a mastery framework,,if you were allowed to reallyntake agency over your learning,,and when you get something wrong,,embrace it -- view that failurenas a moment of learning --,that number, the percentnthat could really master calculus,or understand organic chemistry,,is actually a lot closer to 100 percent. 
 And this isn't even just a "nice to have.",I think it's a social imperative.,We're exiting what you could callnthe industrial age,and we're going intonthis information revolution.,And it's clear that somenthings are happening.,In the industrial age,nsociety was a pyramid.,At the base of the pyramid,nyou needed human labor.,In the middle of the pyramid,nyou had an information processing,,a bureaucracy class,,and at the top of the pyramid,nyou had your owners of capital,and your entrepreneurs,and your creative class.,But we know what's happening already,,as we go into this information revolution.,The bottom of that pyramid,nautomation, is going to take over.,Even that middle tier,ninformation processing,,that's what computers are good at. 
 So as a society, we have a question:,All this new productivity is happeningnbecause of this technology,,but who participates in it?,Is it just going to be that very topnof the pyramid, in which case,,what does everyone else do?,How do they operate?,Or do we do somethingnthat's more aspirational?,Do we actually attemptnto invert the pyramid,,where you have a large creative class,,where almost everyonencan participate as an entrepreneur,,an artist, as a researcher? 
 And I don't think that this is utopian.,I really think that thisnis all based on the idea,that if we let peoplentap into their potential,by mastering concepts,,by being able to exercise agencynover their learning,,that they can get there.,And when you think of itnas just a citizen of the world,,it's pretty exciting.,I mean, think aboutnthe type of equity we can we have,,and the rate at which civilizationncould even progress.,And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.,I think it's going to bena pretty exciting time to be alive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a chef,and a food policy guy,,but I come from a wholenfamily of teachers.,My sister is a special ednteacher in Chicago.,My father just retirednafter 25 years teaching fifth grade.,My aunt and uncle were professors.,My cousins all teach.,Everybody in my family, basically,nteaches except for me.,They taught me that the only waynto get the right answers,is to ask the right questions.,So what are the right questions,when it comes to improvingnthe educational outcomes for our children?,There's obviouslynmany important questions,,but I think the followingnis a good place to start:,What do we think the connection is,between a child's growing mind,and their growing body?,What can we expect our kids to learn,if their diets are full of sugarnand empty of nutrients?,What can they possibly learn,if their bodiesnare literally going hungry?,And with all the resourcesnthat we are pouring into schools,,we should stop and ask ourselves:,Are we really settingnour kids up for success? 
 Now, a few years ago,,I was a judge on a cookingncompetition called "Chopped.",Four chefs competenwith mystery ingredients,to see who can cook the best dishes.,Except for this episode --nit was a very special one.,Instead of four overzealous chefsntrying to break into the limelight --,something that I would knownnothing about --,(Laughter),these chefs were school chefs;,you know, the women that you usednto call "lunch ladies,",but the ones I insistnwe call "school chefs.",Now, these women -- God blessnthese women --,spend their day cookingnfor thousands of kids,,breakfast and lunch,nwith only $2.68 per lunch,,with only about a dollar of thatnactually going to the food.,In this episode,,the main-coursenmystery ingredient was quinoa.,Now, I know it's been a long time,since most of you have had a school lunch,,and we've made a lotnof progress on nutrition,,but quinoa still is not a staplenin most school cafeterias. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this was a challenge.,But the dish that I will never forgetnwas cooked by a woman,named Cheryl Barbara.,Cheryl was the nutrition director,at High School in the Communitynin Connecticut.,She cooked this delicious pasta.,It was amazing.,It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,,kale, Parmesan cheese.,It was delicious, like,nrestaurant-quality good, except --,she basically just threw the quinoa,npretty much uncooked,,into the dish.,It was a strange choice,,and it was super crunchy.,(Laughter),So I took on the TV accusatory judge thingnthat you're supposed to do,,and I asked her why she did that. 
 Cheryl responded, "Well, first,nI don't know what quinoa is.",(Laughter),"But I do know that it's a Monday,,and that in my school,nat High School in the Community,,I always cook pasta." 
 See, Cheryl explainednthat for many of her kids,,there were no meals on the weekends.,No meals on Saturday.,No meals on Sunday, either.,So she cooked pastanbecause she wanted to make sure,she cooked something she knewnher children would eat.,Something that would sticknto their ribs, she said.,Something that would fill them up.,Cheryl talked about how,nby the time Monday came,,her kids' hunger pangs were so intense,that they couldn't even beginnto think about learning.,Food was the only thing on their mind.,The only thing.,And unfortunately, the stats --nthey tell the same story. 
 So, let's put thisninto the context of a child. 
 And we're going to focus on,the most important mealnof the day, breakfast.,Meet Allison.,She's 12 years old,,she's smart as a whip,and she wants to be a physicistnwhen she grows up.,If Allison goes to a schoolnthat serves a nutritious breakfast,to all of their kids,,here's what's going to follow.,Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,,one with fruit and milk,none lower in sugar and salt,,dramatically increase.,Allison will have a lower ratenof obesity than the average kid.,She'll have to visit the nurse less.,She'll have lower levelsnof anxiety and depression.,She'll have better behavior.,She'll have better attendance,nand she'll show up on time more often.,Why?,Well, because there's a good mealnwaiting for her at school.,Overall, Allison is in much better health,than the average school kid. 
 So what about that kid,who doesn't have a nutritiousnbreakfast waiting for him?,Well, meet Tommy.,He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.,He wants to be a doctor.,By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,,he's already underperforming in math.,By the time he's in third grade,,he's got lower math and reading scores.,By the time he's 11,,it's more likely that Tommy will havento have repeated a grade.,Research shows that kidsnwho do not have consistent nourishment,,particularly at breakfast,,have poor cognitive function overall. 
 So how widespread is this problem?,Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.,Let me give you two stats,that seem like they're on oppositenends of the issue,,but are actually two sidesnof the same coin.,On the one hand,,one in six Americans are food insecure,,including 16 million children --nalmost 20 percent --,are food insecure.,In this city alone, in New York City,,474,000 kids under the age of 18nface hunger every year.,It's crazy.,On the other hand,,diet and nutrition is the number one causenof preventable death and disease,in this country, by far.,And fully a third of the kidsnthat we've been talking about tonight,are on track to have diabetesnin their lifetime.,Now, what's hardnto put together but is true,is that, many times,nthese are the same children.,So they fill up on the unhealthynand cheap calories,that surround them in their communitiesnand that their families can afford.,But then by the end of the month,,food stamps run outnor hours get cut at work,,and they don't have the moneynto cover the basic cost of food. 
 But we should be ablento solve this problem, right?,We know what the answers are.,As part of my work at the White House,nwe instituted a program,that for all schools that hadn40 percent more low-income kids,,we could serve breakfast and lunchnto every kid in that school.,For free. 
 This program has beennincredibly successful,,because it helped us overcomena very difficult barrier,when it came to getting kidsna nutritious breakfast.,And that was the barrier of stigma.,See, schools servenbreakfast before school,,and it was only availablenfor the poor kids.,So everybody knew who was poornand who needed government help.,Now, all kids, no matter how muchnor how little their parents make,,have a lot of pride.,So what happened?,Well, the schools that havenimplemented this program,saw an increase in math and readingnscores by 17.5 percent.,17.5 percent.,And research shows that when kidsnhave a consistent, nutritious breakfast,,their chances of graduatingnincrease by 20 percent.,20 percent.,When we give our kidsnthe nourishment they need,,we give them the chance to thrive,,both in the classroom and beyond. 
 Now, you don't have to trust me on this,,but you should talk to Donna Martin.,I love Donna Martin.,Donna Martin is the school nutritionndirector at Burke County,in Waynesboro, Georgia.,Burke County is onenof the poorest districts,in the fifth-poorest state in the country,,and about 100 percent of Donna's studentsnlive at or below the poverty line.,A few years ago,,Donna decided to get out aheadnof the new standards that were coming,,and overhaul her nutrition standards.,She improved and addednfruit and vegetables and whole grains.,She served breakfast in the classroomnto all of her kids.,And she implemented a dinner program.,Why?,Well, many of her kids didn't havendinner when they went home. 
 So how did they respond?,Well, the kids loved the food.,They loved the better nutrition,,and they loved not being hungry.,But Donna's biggest supporterncame from an unexpected place.,His name from Eric Parker,,and he was the head football coachnfor the Burke County Bears.,Now, Coach Parker had coachednmediocre teams for years.,The Bears often endednin the middle of the pack --,a big disappointment in onenof the most passionate football states,in the Union.,But the year Donna changed the menus,,the Bears not only won their division,,they went on to winnthe state championship,,beating the Peach County Trojans,28-14. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Coach Parker,,he credited that championshipnto Donna Martin. 
 When we give our kidsnthe basic nourishment,,they're going to thrive.,And it's not justnup to the Cheryl Barbaras,and the Donna Martins of the world.,It's on all of us.,And feeding our kids the basic nutritionnis just the starting point.,What I've laid out is really a model,for so many of the most pressingnissues that we face.,If we focus on the simple goalnof properly nourishing ourselves,,we could see a worldnthat is more stable and secure;,we could dramatically improvenour economic productivity;,we could transform our health care,and we could go a long way,in ensuring that the Earth can providenfor generations to come.,Food is that placenwhere our collective efforts,can have the greatest impact. 
 So we have to ask ourselves:nWhat is the right question?,What would happen,if we fed ourselves more nutritious,nmore sustainably grown food?,What would be the impact?,Cheryl Barbara,,Donna Martin,,Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --,I think they know the answer. 
 Thank you guys so very much. 
 (Applause)For over a decade,,I have studied young peoplenthat have been pushed out of school,,so called "dropouts.",As they end up failednby the education system,,they're on the streetsnwhere they're vulnerable to violence,,police harassment,,police brutality,and incarceration.,I follow these young peoplenfor years at a time,,across institutional settings,,to try to understand what some of us callnthe "school-to-prison pipeline." 
 When you look at a picture like this,,of young people who are in my study ...,you might see trouble.,I mean one of the boysnhas a bottle of liquor in his hand,,he's 14 years old,and it's a school day.,Other people, when they see this picture,,might see gangs,,thugs, delinquents --,criminals.,But I see it different.,I see these young peoplenthrough a perspective,that looks at the assetsnthat they bring to the education system.,So will you join me in changingnthe way we label young people,from "at-risk" to "at-promise?" 
 (Applause) 
 How do I know that these young people,have the potentialnand the promise to change?,I know this because I am one of them.,You see, I grew upnin dire poverty in the inner city,,without a father --,he abandoned me before I was even born.,We were on welfare,,sometimes homeless,,many times hungry.,By the time I was 15 years old,,I had been incarcerated in juvynthree times for three felonies.,My best friend had already been killed.,And soon after,,while I'm standing next to my uncle,,he gets shot.,And as I'm waitingnfor the ambulance to arrive,for over an hour ...,he bleeds to death on the street.,I had lost faith and hope in the world,,and I had given up on the systemnbecause the system had failed me.,I had nothing to offer,and no one had anything to offer me.,I was fatalistic.,I didn't even thinknI could make it to my 18th birthday. 
 The reason I'm here today,is because a teachernthat cared reached out,and managed to tap into my soul.,This teacher,,Ms. Russ ...,she was the kind of teachernthat was always in your business. 
 (Laughter) 
 She was the kind of teacher that was like,,"Victor, I'm here for younwhenever you're ready." 
 (Laughter) 
 I wasn't ready.,But she understood one basic principlenabout young people like me.,We're like oysters.,We're only going to open upnwhen we're ready,,and if you're not there when we're ready,,we're going to clam back up.,Ms. Russ was there for me.,She was culturally relevant,,she respected my community,nmy people, my family.,I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.,He would take me to work with himnbecause I was broke,,and he knew I needed some money.,He collected glass bottles for a living.,Four in the morning on a school day,,we'd throw the glass bottlesnin the back of his van,,and the bottles would break.,And my hands and arms would start to bleed,and my tennis shoes and pantsnwould get all bloody.,And I was terrified and in pain,nand I would stop working.,And my uncle, he would look me in the eyesnand he would say to me,,"Mijo,,estamos buscando vida.","We're searching for a better life,,we're trying to makensomething out of nothing." 
 Ms. Russ listened to my story,,welcomed it into the classroom and said,,"Victor, this is your power.,This is your potential.,Your family, your culture, your communitynhave taught you a hard-work ethic,and you will use it to empowernyourself in the academic world,so you can come backnand empower your community." 
 With Ms. Russ's help,,I ended up returning to school.,I even finished my credits on time,and graduated with my class. 
 (Applause) 
 But Ms. Russ said to menright before graduation,,"Victor, I'm so proud of you.,I knew you could do it.,Now it's time to go to college." 
 (Laughter) 
 College, me?,Man, what is this teacher smokingnthinking I'm going to college?,I applied with the mentorsnand support she provided,,got a letter of acceptance,,and one of the paragraphs read,,"You've been admittednunder probationary status.",I said, "Probation?nI'm already on probation,,that don't matter?" 
 (Laughter) 
 It was academic probation,nnot criminal probation.,But what do teachers like Ms. Russndo to succeed with young people,like the ones I study?,I propose three strategies.,The first:,let's get rid of ourndeficit perspective in education.,"These peoplencome from a culture of violence,,a culture of poverty.,These people are at-risk;nthese people are truant.,These people are empty containersnfor us to fill with knowledge.,They have the problems,,we have the solutions.",Number two.,Let's value the stories that young peoplenbring to the schoolhouse.,Their stories of overcomingninsurmountable odds are so powerful.,And I know you know some of these stories.,These very same stories and experiences,already have grit, characternand resilience in them.,So let's help young peoplenrefine those stories.,Let's help them be proud of who they are,,because our education systemnwelcomes their families, their cultures,,their communities,and the skill setnthey've learned to survive.,And of course the third strategynbeing the most important:,resources.,We have to providenadequate resources to young people.,Grit alone isn't going to cut it.,You can sit therenand tell me all you want,,"Hey man, pick yourself upnby the bootstraps.",But if I was bornnwithout any straps on my boots -- 
 (Laughter) 
 How am I supposed to pick myself up? 
 (Applause) 
 Job training,,mentoring,,counseling ...,Teaching young peoplento learn from their mistakes,instead of criminalizing them,,and dragging them outnof their classrooms like animals.,How about this?,I propose that we implement restorativenjustice in every high school in America. 
 (Applause) 
 So we went out to test these ideasnin the community of Watts in LA,with 40 young peoplenthat had been pushed out of school.,William was one of them.,William was the kind of kidnthat had been given every label.,He had dropped out, he was a gang member,,a criminal.,And when we met him he was very resistant.,But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.,"Hey, I'm here for younwhenever you're ready." 
 (Laughter) 
 So over time --,over time he began to open up.,And I remember the daynthat he made the switch.,We were in a large group,and a young lady in our program was crying,because she told us her powerful story,of her dad being killed,and then his body being shownnin the newspaper the next day.,And as she's crying,nI don't know what to do,,so I give her her space,,and William had enough.,He slammed his handsnon the desk and he said,,"Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!" 
 (Applause) 
 This young lady's tears and painnturned into joy and laughter,knowing that her community had her back,,and William had now learnednthat he did have a purpose in life:,to help to heal the soulsnof people in his own community.,He told us his story.,We refined his story,to go from being the story of a victimnto being the story of a survivor,that has overcome adversity.,We placed high value on it.,William went on to finish high school,,get his security guard certificatento become a security guard,,and is now workingnat a local school district. 
 (Applause) 
 Ms. Russ's mantra --,her mantra was always,,"when you teach to the heart,nthe mind will follow.",The great writer Khalil Gibran says,,"Out of sufferingnhave emerged the greatest souls.,The massive charactersnare seared with scars.",I believe that in this educationnrevolution that we're talking about,we need to invite the soulsnof the young people that we work with,,and once they're able to refine --,identify their grit,nresilience and character,that they've already developed --,their academic performance will improve. 
 Let's believe in young people.,Let's provide themnthe right kinds of resources.,I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.,She believed in me so much,that she tricked meninto believing in myself. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,,81's platoon,,out in Camp Pendleton, California.,Oorah! 
 Audience: Oorah! 
 (Laughter) 
 I joined a few months after September 11,,feeling like I think most peoplenin the country did at the time,,filled with a sensenof patriotism and retribution,and the desire to do something --,that, coupled with that factnthat I wasn't doing anything.,I was 17, just graduatednfrom high school that past summer,,living in the back roomnof my parents' house paying rent,,in the small town I was raised innin Northern Indiana,,called Mishawaka.,I can spell that laternfor people who are interested -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Mishawaka is many good thingsnbut cultural hub of the world it is not,,so my only exposure to theater and film,was limited to the playsnI did in high school,and Blockbuster Video,nmay she rest in peace. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was serious enough about acting,that I auditioned for Juilliardnwhen I was a senior in high school,,didn't get in,,determined college wasn't for menand applied nowhere else,,which was a genius move.,I also did that Hail MarynLA acting odyssey,that I always heard stories about,,of actors moving to LAnwith, like, seven dollars,and finding work and successful careers.,I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,nbefore my car broke down.,I spent all my money repairing it,,finally made it to Santa Monica --,not even LA --,stayed for 48 hours wanderingnthe beach, basically,,got in my car, drove home,,thus ending my acting career, so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Seventeen, Mishawaka ...,parents' house, paying rent,nselling vacuums ...,telemarketing,,cutting grass at the localn4-H fairgrounds.,This was my worldngoing into September, 2001. 
 So after the 11th,,and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,,and just being pissed offnin general -- at myself,,my parents, the government;,not having confidence,nnot having a respectable job,,my shitty mini-fridge that I justndrove to California and back --,I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.nI loved being a Marine.,It's one of the things I'm most proudnof having done in my life.,Firing weapons was cool,,driving and detonatingnexpensive things was great.,But I found I lovednthe Marine Corps the most,for the thing I was lookingnfor the least when I joined,,which was the people:,these weird dudes --na motley crew of characters,from a cross sectionnof the United States --,that on the surface I hadnnothing in common with.,And over time,,all the political and personal bravado,that led me to the military dissolved,,and for me, the Marine Corpsnbecame synonymous with my friends. 
 And then, a few years into my service,and months away from deploying to Iraq,,I dislocated my sternumnin a mountain-biking accident,,and had to be medically separated.,Those never in the militarynmay find this hard to understand,,but being told I wasn't getting deployednto Iraq or Afghanistan,was very devastating for me.,I have a very clear image of leavingnthe base hospital on a stretcher,and my entire platoon is waitingnoutside to see if I was OK. 
 And then, suddenly,nI was a civilian again.,I knew I wanted to givenacting another shot,,because -- again, this is me --,I thought all civilian problemsnare small compared to the military.,I mean, what can you reallynbitch about now, you know?,"It's hot.,Someone should turnnon the air conditioner.","This coffee line is too long.",I was a Marine,,I knew how to survive.,I'd go to New York and become an actor.,If things didn't work out,,I'd live in Central Parknand dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread. 
 (Laughter) 
 I re-auditioned for Juilliardnand this time I was lucky,,I got in.,But I was surprisednby how complex the transition was,from military to civilian.,And I was relatively healthy; I can'tnimagine going through that process,on top of a mental or physical injury.,But regardless, it was difficult.,In part, because I was in acting school --,I couldn't justify goingnto voice and speech class,,throwing imaginary balls of energynat the back of the room,,doing acting exercisesnwhere I gave birth to myself -- 
 (Laughter) 
 while my friends were servingnwithout me overseas.,But also, because I didn'tnknow how to apply the things,I learned in the militarynto a civilian context.,I mean that both practicallynand emotionally.,Practically, I had to get a job.,And I was an Infantry Marine,,where you're shooting machine gunsnand firing mortars.,There's not a lot of places you cannput those skills in the civilian world. 
 (Laughter) 
 Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.,In the military, everything has meaning.,Everything you donis either steeped in tradition,or has a practical purpose.,You can't smoke in the field,because you don't wantnto give away your position.,You don't touch your face --nyou have to maintain,a personal level of health and hygiene.,You face this way when "Colors" plays,,out of respect for peoplenwho went before you.,Walk this way, talk this waynbecause of this.,Your uniform is maintained to the inch.,How diligently you followednthose rules spoke volumes,about the kind of Marine you were.,Your rank said somethingnabout your history,and the respect you had earned. 
 In the civilian world there's no rank.,Here you're just another body,,and I felt like I constantly hadnto prove my worth all over again.,And the respect civilians were giving menwhile I was in uniform,didn't exist when I was out of it.,There didn't seem to be a ...,a sense of community,,whereas in the military,nI felt this sense of community.,How often in the civilian world,are you put in a life-or-death situationnwith your closest friends,and they constantly demonstratenthat they're not going to abandon you?,And meanwhile, at acting school ... 
 (Laughter) 
 I was really, for the first time,,discovering playwrightsnand characters and plays,that had nothing to do with the military,,but were somehow describingnmy military experience,in a way that beforento me was indescribable.,And I felt myself becoming less aggressive,as I was able to put wordsnto feelings for the first time,and realizing whatna valuable tool that was. 
 And when I was reflectingnon my time in the military,,I wasn't first thinkingnon the stereotypical drills,and discipline and pain of it;,but rather, the small,nintimate human moments,,moments of great feeling:,friends going AWOLnbecause they missed their families,,friends getting divorced,,grieving together, celebrating together,,all within the backdrop of the military.,I saw my friends battlingnthese circumstances,,and I watched the anxietynit produced in them and me,,not being able to expressnour feelings about it. 
 The military and theater communitiesnare actually very similar.,You have a group of peoplentrying to accomplish a mission,greater than themselves;nit's not about you.,You have a role, you have to knownyour role within that team.,Every team has a leader or director;,sometimes they're smart,nsometimes they're not.,You're forced to be intimatenwith complete strangers,in a short amount of time;,the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.,I thought, how great would it bento create a space,that combined these two seeminglyndissimilar communities,,that brought entertainmentnto a group of people,that, considering their occupation,,could handle somethingna bit more thought-provoking,than the typical mandatory-fun events,that I remember beingn"volun-told" to go to in the military -- 
 (Laughter) 
 all well-intended but slightlynoffensive events,,like "Win a Date with a San DiegonChargers Cheerleader,",where you answer a questionnabout pop culture,,and if you get it right you win a date,,which was a chaperoned walknaround the parade deck,with this already married,npregnant cheerleader -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Nothing against cheerleaders,nI love cheerleaders.,The point is more, how great would itnbe to have theater presented,through characters that were accessiblenwithout being condescending.,So we started this nonprofitncalled Arts in the Armed Forces,,where we tried to do that,,tried to join these two seeminglyndissimilar communities.,We pick a play or select monologuesnfrom contemporary American plays,that are diverse in age and racenlike a military audience is,,grab a group of incrediblentheater-trained actors,,arm them with incredible material,,keep production valuenas minimal as possible --,no sets, no costumes,nno lights, just reading it --,to throw all the emphasis on the language,and to show that theater cannbe created at any setting. 
 It's a powerful thing,,getting in a room with complete strangers,and reminding ourselves of our humanity,,and that self-expressionnis just as valuable a tool,as a rifle on your shoulder.,And for an organization like the military,,that prides itself on havingnacronyms for acronyms,,you can get lost in the sauce,when it comes to explainingna collective experience.,And I can think of no better community,to arm with a new means of self-expression,than those protecting our country. 
 We've gone all overnthe United States and the world,,from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,,to Camp Pendleton,nto Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,,to USAG Bavaria,,on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.,And for the performing artists we bring,,it's a window into a culture,they otherwise would notnhave had exposure to.,And for the military, it's the exact same. 
 And in doing this for the past six years,,I'm always remindednthat acting is many things.,It's a craft, it's a political act,nit's a business, it's --,whatever adjectivenis most applicable to you.,But it's also a service.,I didn't get to finish mine,,so whenever I get to be of service,to this ultimate service industry,nthe military, for me, again --,there's not many things better than that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We're going to be doing a piecenfrom Marco Ramirez,,called "I am not Batman.",An incredible actornand good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,,is going to be reading,,and Matt Johnson,nwho I just met a couple hours ago.,They're doing it togethernfor the first time,,so we'll see how it goes. 
 Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson. 
 (Applause) 
 Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night,and the sky is glowingnlike mad, radioactive red.,And if you squint,nyou can maybe see the moon,through a thick layer of cigarette smokenand airplane exhaust,that covers the whole city,,like a mosquito netnthat won't let the angels in. 
 (Drum beat) 
 And if you look up high enough,,you can see me standingnon the edge of an 87-story building.,And up there, a place for gargoylesnand broken clock towers,that have stayed still and deadnfor maybe like 100 years,,up there is me. 
 (Beat) 
 And I'm frickin' Batman. 
 (Beat) 
 And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs,and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.,And all it takes is a broom closet,or a back room or a fire escape,,and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.,And my navy blue polo shirt,,the one that looks kinda good on menbut has that hole on it near the butt,from when it got snaggednon the chain-link fence behind Arturo's,but it isn't even a big dealnbecause I tuck that part in,and it's, like, all good.,That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!,And I get like, like ... transformational. 
 (Beat) 
 And nobody pulls out a beltnand whips Batman for talkin' back. 
 (Beat) 
 Or for not talkin' back. 
 And nobody calls Batman simple,or stupid,or skinny.,And nobody fires Batman's brothernfrom the Eastern Taxi Company,'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.,'Cause they got nothing but respect.,And not like afraid-respect,,just, like, respect-respect. 
 (Laughter) 
 'Cause nobody's afraid of you.,'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm. 
 (Beat) 
 Ever.n(Double beat) 
 'Cause all Batman really wantsnto do is save people,and maybe pay abuela's bills one day,and die happy.,And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh -- and kill the Joker. 
 (Drum roll) 
 Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.,And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin',like a eagle,or like a --,no, yeah, like a eagle. 
 (Laughter) 
 And my cape is flapping in the windncause it's frickin' long,and my pointy ears are on,,and that mask that covers like halfnmy face is on, too,,and I got, like, bulletproof stuffnall in my chest so no one can hurt me.,And nobody -- nobody! --,is gonna come between Batman ...,and justice. 
 (Drums)n(Laughter) 
 From where I am,,I can hear everything. 
 (Silence) 
 Somewhere in the city,,there's a old lady pickingnStyrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can,and she's putting a piecenof sesame chicken someone spit out,into her own mouth.,And somewhere there's a doctornwith a wack haircut in a black lab coat,trying to find a cure for the diseases,that are gonna make usnall extinct for real one day.,And somewhere there's a man,,a man in a janitor's uniform,,stumbling home drunk and dizzy,after spending half his paychecknon 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,,and the other half on a four-hour visitnto some lady's house,on a street where the lightsnhave all been shot out,by people who'd rather donwhat they do in this city in the dark.,And half a block away from janitor man,,there's a group of good-for-nothingsnwho don't know no better,,waiting for janitor mannwith rusted bicycle chains,and imitation Louisville Sluggers,,and if they don't find a cent on him,,which they won't,,they'll just pound at him till the musclesnin their arms start burning,,till there's no more teeth to crack out. 
 But they don't count on me.,They don't count on no Dark Knight,,with a stomach full of grocery-storenbrand macaroni and cheese,and cut-up Vienna sausages. 
 (Laughter) 
 'Cause they'd rather believenI don't exist. 
 And from 87 stories up, I can hearnone of the good-for-nothings say,,"Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that,,just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!",And I see janitor man mumble somethingnin drunk language and turn pale,,and from 87 stories up,,I can hear his stomach tryingnto hurl its way out his Dickies. 
 So I swoop down, like, mad-fast,and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!",And I throw a batarangnat the one naked lightbulb. 
 (Cymbal) 
 And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!,Who just turned out the lights?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "What's that over there?"n"What?" 
 "Gimme me what you got, old man!" 
 "Did anybody hear that?","Hear what? There ain't nothing.nNo, really -- there ain't no bat!" 
 But then ...,one out of the three good-for-nothingsngets it to the head -- pow! 
 And number two swings blindlyninto the dark cape before him,,but before his fist hits anything,,I grab a trash can lid and --,right in the gut!,And number one comesnback with the jump kick,,but I know judo karate, too,nso I'm like -- 
 (Drums) 
 Twice! 
 (Drums) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Drums) 
 But before I can do any more damage,,suddenly we all hear a "click-click.",And suddenly everything gets quiet.,And the one good-for-nothing left standing,grips a handgun and aims it straight up,,like he's holding Jesus hostage,,like he's threatening maybento blow a hole in the moon.,And the good-for-nothingnwho got it to the head,,who tried to jump-kick me,,and the other good-for-nothingnwho got it in the gut,,is both scrambling back awaynfrom the dark figure before 'em.,And the drunk man, the janitor man,,is huddled in a corner,npraying to Saint Anthony,'cause that's the only onenhe could remember. 
 (Double beat),And there's me:,eyes glowing white,,cape blowing softly in the wind. 
 (Beat),Bulletproof chest heaving,,my heart beating right through itnin a Morse code for:,"Fuck with me,just once,come on,just try." 
 And the one good-for-nothingnleft standing,,the one with the handgun --,yeah, he laughs.,And he lowers his arm.,And he points it at me,and gives the moon a break.,And he aims it rightnbetween my pointy ears,,like goal posts and he's special teams.,And janitor man is stillncalling Saint Anthony,,but he ain't pickin' up.,And for a second,,it seems like ...,maybe I'm gonna lose. 
 Nah! 
 (Drums) 
 Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka! 
 "Don't kill me, man!" 
 Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash! 
 Skin meets acid:n"Ahhhhhhh!" 
 And he's on the floor,and I'm standing over him,and I got the gun in my hands now,and I hate guns, I hate holding 'emn'cause I'm Batman.,And, asterisk:,Batman don't like guns 'cause his parentsngot iced by guns a long time ago.,But for just a second,,my eyes glow white,,and I hold this thing,for I could speak to the good-for-nothing,in a language he maybe understands.,Click-click! 
 (Beat) 
 And the good-for-nothingsnbecome good-for-disappearing,into whatever toxic waste, chemicalnsludge shithole they crawled out of.,And it's just me and janitor man.,And I pick him up,,and I wipe sweat and cheap perfumenoff his forehead.,And he begs me not to hurt him,and I grab him tightnby his janitor-man shirt collar,,and I pull him to my face,and he's taller than menbut the cape helps,,so he listens when I look himnstraight in the eyes.,And I say two words to him:,"Go home." 
 And he does,,checking behind his shouldernevery 10 feet.,And I swoosh from buildingnto building on his way there,'cause I know where he lives.,And I watch his hands tremblenas he pulls out his key chain,and opens the door to his building.,And I'm back in bed,before he even walks innthrough the front door. 
 And I hear him turn on the faucet,and pour himself a glassnof warm tap water.,And he puts the glass back in the sink.,And I hear his footsteps.,And they get slowernas they get to my room.,And he creaks my door open,nlike, mad-slow.,And he takes a step in,,which he never does. 
 (Beat),And he's staring off into nowhere,,his face, the colornof sidewalks in summer.,And I act like I'm just waking up,and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?",And janitor man says nothing to me.,But I see in the dark,,I see his arms go limp,and his head turns back, like, towards me.,And he lifts it for I can see his face,,for I could see his eyes.,And his cheeks is drippin',nbut not with sweat.,And he just stands there breathing,,like he remembers my eyes glowing white,,like he remembers my bulletproof chest,,like he remembers he's my pop.,And for a long time I don't say nothin'.,And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.,And he ain't looking my way,,but I hear him mumble two words to me:,"I'm sorry." 
 And I lean over, and I opennmy window just a crack.,If you look up high enough,,you could see me.,And from where I am -- 
 (Cymbals) 
 I could hear everything. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I believe big institutions,have unique potential to create change,,and I believe that we as individuals,have unique power,to influence the directionnthat those institutions take. 
 Now, these beliefs did notncome naturally to me,,because trusting big institutions,,not really part of my family legacy.,My mother escaped North Korea,when she was 10 years old.,To do so, she had to eludenevery big institution in her life:,repressive governments, occupying armies,and even armed border patrols.,Later, when she decided she wantednto emigrate to the United States,,she had to defy an entire culture,that said the girls would nevernbe the best and brightest.,Only because her namenhappens to sound like a boy's,was she able to finagle her wayninto the government immigration exam,to come to the United States. 
 Because of her bravery and passion,,I've had all the opportunitiesnthat she never did,,and that has made my story so different.,Instead of running awaynfrom big institutions,,I've actually run toward them.,I've had the chancenover the course of my career,to work for The Wall Street Journal,,the White House,and now one of the largestnfinancial institutions in the world,,where I lead sustainable investing. 
 Now, these institutions are like tankers,,and working inside of them,,I've come to appreciatenwhat large wakes they can leave,,and I've become convinced,that the institutionnof the global capital markets,,the nearly 290 trillion dollarsnof stocks and bonds in the world,,that that may be onenof our most powerful forces,for positive social changenat our disposal,,if we ask it to be. 
 Now, I know some of you are thinking,,global capital markets,npositive social change,,not usually in the same sentencenor even the same paragraph.,I think many people thinknof the capital markets,kind of like an ocean.,It's a vast, impersonal,nuncaring force of nature,that is not affectednby our wishes or desires.,So the best that ournlittle savings accounts,or retirement accounts can do,is to try to catch some wavesnin the good cycles,and hope that we don't getninundated in the turbulent ones,,but certainly our decisions on hownto steer our little retirement accounts,don't affect the tides,,don't change the shape or sizenor direction of the waves. 
 But why is that?,Because actually,none third of this ocean of capital,actually belongs to individuals like us,,and most of the restnof the capital markets,is controlled by the institutionsnthat get their power and authority,and their capital from us,,as members, participants,nbeneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.,So if we are the ultimate ownersnof the capital markets,,why aren't we ablento make our voices heard?,Why can't we make some waves? 
 So let me ask you a different question:,did any of you buy fair trade coffee,the last time you werenat a supermarket or at Starbucks?,OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant,and order the sustainably farmed trout,instead of the miso-glazednChilean sea bass,that you really wish you could have?,Do any of you drive hybrid carsnor even electric cars? 
 So why do we do these things?,Right? One electric car doesn't amountnto much in a fleet of 1.2 billion,combustion engine vehicles.,One fish is just one fish in the sea.,And one cup of coffee,doesn't amount to a hill of beansnin this crazy world.,But we do these thingsnbecause we believe they matter,,that our actions add up,,that our choices might influence others,and collectively,nwhat an impact we can have. 
 So, in my bag I have a coffee mugnthat I bought a couple of years ago.,It's a reusable mug.nIt has all these things printed on it.,Look at some of the thingsnthat are on it, that it says. 
 "This one cup can be usednagain and again." 
 "This one cup may inspire othersnto use one too." 
 "This one cup helps save the planet.",I had no idea this plastic cupnwas so powerful. 
 (Laughter) 
 So why do we think that our choice,of a four dollar shade-grownnfair trade artisanal cup of coffee,in a reusable mug matters,,but what we do with 4,000 dollarsnin our investment account,for our IRA doesn't?,Why can't we tell the supermarketnand the capital markets,that we care,,that we care about fair labor standards,,that we care about sustainablenproduction methods,and about healthy communities?,Why aren't we votingnwith our investment dollars,,but we would vote with our lattes? 
 So I think it has somethingnto do with the myths,,the fables that we all carry aroundnin our collective consciousness.,Do you remember the Grimm's fairy talenabout the magic porridge pot?,If you said to the pot,n"Boil, little pot, boil,",it would fill up with sweet porridge.,And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,",it would stop.,But if you got the words wrong,nit wouldn't listen,,and things could go terribly awry.,So I think when it comes to markets,,we have a little bitnof a similar fable in our heads.,We believe that the marketsnis this magic pot,that obeys only one command:,make more money.,Only those words said exactly that way,will make the pot fill up with gold.,Add in some extra wordsnlike "protect the environment,",the spell might not work.,Put in the wrong wordsnlike "promote social justice,",and you might see your gold coins shrink,or even vanish entirely,naccording to this fable. 
 So we asked people,nwhat do you really think?,And we actually went out and polledna thousand individual investors,,and we found something fascinating.,Overwhelmingly,,people wanted to addnthose extra words into the formula.,71 percent of people said yes,,they were interestednin sustainable investing,,which we define as taking the bestnin class investment process,that you already have traditionally,and adding in the extraninformation you get,when you think about the environmentnand society and good governance.,71 percent wanted that.,72 percent said that they believenthat companies who did that,would actually do better financially.,So people really do believenthat you can do well by doing good.,But here was the weird thing:,54 percent of the people,still said if they put their moneynin those kinds of stocks,,they thought that theynwould make less money. 
 So is it true?,Do you get less sweet porridgenif you invest in shade-grown coffee,instead of drinking it?,Well, you know, the investorsnin companies like Burt's Bees,or Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so.,Right? Both of those started outnas small, socially conscious companies,that ended up becomingnso popular with consumers,that the giants Unilevernand Clorox bought them,for hundreds of millions of dollars,each.,But here's the important thing.,Those corporations realized,that if they wanted to protectnthe value of their investments,,they had to preserventhat socially conscious mission.,If they didn't keep adding innthose extra words,of environmentally friendlynand socially conscious,,those brands wouldn't make more money. 
 But maybe this is just the exceptionnthe proves the rule, right?,The serious companiesnthat fund our economy,and that fund our retirementsnand that really make the world go round,,they need to stick to making more money.,So, Harvard Business Schoolnactually researched this,,and they found something fascinating.,If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago,in a portfolio of companies,that focused narrowly on making more money,quarter by quarter,,that one dollar,would have grownnto 14 dollars and 46 cents.,That's not bad until you consider,that if insteadnyou'd invested that same dollar,in a portfolio of companies,that focused on growing their business,and on the most importantnenvironmental and social issues,,that one dollar would have grown,to 28 dollars and 36 cents.,almost twice as much sweet porridge. 
 Now, let's be clear, they didn't makenthat outperformance,by giving away moneynto seem like a nice corporate citizen.,They did it by focusing on the thingsnthat matter to their business,,like wasting less energy and water,in their manufacturing processes;,like making sure the CEO contractsnhad the CEOs incentivized,for the long-term results of the companynand the communities they served,,not just quarterly results;,or building a first class culture,that would have higher employee loyalty,,retention and productivity.,Now, Harvard's not alone.,Oxford also did a research studynwhere they examined 120 different studies,looking at the effectnof sustainability and economic results,,and they foundntime and time and time again,that the companies that carednabout these kinds of important things,actually had betternoperational efficiency,,lower cost of capital,and better performancenin their stock price. 
 And then there's Al Gore.,So 20 years ago, when I workednfor Al Gore in the White House,,he was one of the early pioneersnpleading with businesses and governments,to pay attention to the challengesnof climate change.,Post-White House, he openednan investment firm called Generation,,where he baked environmentalnsustainability and other things,right into the core investment process.,And at the time there wasna good bit of skepticism about his views.,Ten years later, his track recordnis one more proof point,that sustainable investing done rightncan be sound investing.,Far from making less sweet porridge,because he addednsustainability into the mix,,he actually significantlynoutperformed the benchmark. 
 Now, sustainable investing,,the good news isnit doesn't require a magic spell,and it doesn't requirensome investment secret,,and it's not just for the elite.,It is not just about private equitynfor billionaires.,It's not just groovy-sounding investmentsnlike clean technology,or microfinance in emerging markets,or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.,It's about stocks and bondsnand Fortune 500 companies.,It's about mutual funds.,It's about all the things,we already see in the market today. 
 So here's why I'm convinced,that we collectively have the power,to make sustainable investingnthe new normal. 
 First, the proof pointsnare coming out all the time,that sustainable investing done right,,preserving all the samengood principles of investing,,the traditional sphere, can pay.,It makes sense. 
 Secondly,,the biggest obstacle standing in our way,may actually just be in our heads.,We just need to let go of that myth,that if you add your valuesninto your investment thinking,,that you get less sweet porridge.,And once you get rid of the fable,,you can actually start appreciatingnthose facts we've been talking about. 
 And third, the future is already here.,Sustainable investment todaynis a 20 trillion dollar market,and it's the fastest-growing segmentnof the investment industry.,In the United States,nit has grown enormously, as you can see.,It now representsnone out of every six dollars,under professional managementnin the United States. 
 So what are we waiting for?,For me, it goes back to the inspirationnthat I received from my mother.,She knew that she wanted a life,where she would have the freedomnto make her own choices,and to have her voice heardnand write her own story.,She was passionate about that goal,and she was clear that she would letnno army, no obstacle,,no big institution stand in her way.,She made it to the States,,and she became a teacher,,an award-winning author,and a mother,,and ended up sendingnher daughters to Harvard.,And these days, you can tellnthat she is amply comfortable,holding court in the most powerfulninstitutions in the world.,It seems almost too prophetic,that her name in Korean means,"passionate clarity." 
 Passionate clarity:,that's what I think we neednto drive change.,Passion about the changenwe want to see in the world,,and clarity that we are ablento help chart the course.,We have more opportunity todaynthan ever before,to make choices.,We have more power than ever beforento make our voices heard. 
 So change your perspective.,Vote with your small change.,Invest in the changenyou want to see in the world.,Change the fables,and change the markets. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Will we do whatever it takesnto tackle climate change? 
 I come at this questionnnot as a green campaigner,,in fact, I confess to be rathernhopeless at recycling.,I come at it as a professional observernof financial policy making,and someone that wondersnhow history will judge us. 
 One day,,this ring that belonged to my grandfather,will pass to my son, Charlie.,And I wonder what his generation,and perhaps the one that follows,will make of the two livesnthis ring has worked. 
 My grandfather was a coal miner.,In his time,,burning fossil fuels for energynand for allowing economies to develop,was accepted.,We know now that that is not the case,because of the greenhousengases that coal produces.,But today,,I fear it's the industry in which I worknthat will be judged more harshly,because of its impact on the climate --,more harshly thannmy grandfather's industry, even. 
 I work, of course,nin the banking industry,,which will be rememberednfor its crisis in 2008 --,a crisis that diverted the attentionnand finances of governments,away from some really, reallynimportant promises,,like promises made at the CopenhagennClimate Summit in 2009,to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year,to help developing countriesnmove away from burning fossil fuels,and transition to using cleaner energy.,That promise is already in jeopardy.,And that's a real problem,,because that transitionnto cleaner energy needs to happen,sooner rather than later. 
 Firstly,,because greenhouse gases, once released,,stay in the atmosphere for decades.,And secondly,,if a developing economy buildsnits power grid around fossil fuels today,,it's going to be way more costlynto change later on.,So for the climate,,history may judgenthat the banking crisis happened,at just the wrong time.,The story need not be this gloomy, though. 
 Three years ago,,I argued that governmentsncould use the tools,deployed to save the financial system,to meet other global challenges.,And these arguments are gettingnstronger, not weaker, with time.,Let's take a brief remindernof what those tools looked like. 
 When the financial crisis hit in 2008,,the central banks of the US and UK,began buying bonds issuednby their own governments,in a policy knownnas "quantitative easing.",Depending on what happensnto those bonds when they mature,,this is money printing by another name.,And boy, did they print.,The US alone created four trillionndollars' worth of its own currency.,This was not done in isolation.,In a remarkable act of cooperation,,the 188 countries that make upnthe International Monetary Fund, the IMF,,agreed to issue 250 billionndollars' worth of their own currency --,the Special Drawing Right --,to boost reserves around the world. 
 When the financial crisis moved to Europe,,the European Central BanknPresident, Mario Draghi,,promised "to do whatever it takes.",And they did.,The Bank of Japan repeated those words --nthat exact same commitment --,to do "whatever it takes"nto reflate their economy.,In both cases,,"whatever it takes" meantntrillions of dollars more,in money-printing policiesnthat continue today.,What this shows,is that when facednwith some global challenges,,policy makers are able to actncollectively, with urgency,,and run the risks of unconventionalnpolicies like money printing. 
 So, let's go backnto that original question:,Can we print money for climate finance?,Three years ago,,the idea of using money in this waynwas something of a taboo.,Once you break down and dismantle the idea,that money is a finite resource,,governments can quickly get overwhelmednby demands from their people,to print more and morenmoney for other causes:,education, health care, welfare --,even defense. 
 And there are some truly terriblenhistorical examples of money printing --,uncontrolled money printing --,leading to hyperinflation.,Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;,Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,,when the prices of basic goodsnlike bread are doubling every day.,But all of this is movingnthe public debate forward,,so much so, that money printingnfor the people is now discussed openly,in the financial media, and evennin some political manifestos. 
 But it's important the debatendoesn't stop here,,with printing national currencies.,Because climate changenis a shared global problem,,there are some really compelling reasons,why we should be printingnthat international currency,that's issued by the IMF,,to fund it.,The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,,is the IMF's electronic unit of account,that governments use to transfernfunds amongst each other.,Think of it as a peer-to-peernpayment network,,like Bitcoin, but for governments. 
 And it's truly global.,Each of the 188 membersnof the IMF hold SDR quotas,as part of their foreignnexchange reserves.,These are national stores of wealth,that countries keep to protectnthemselves against currency crises.,And that global nature is why,,at the height of the financialncrisis in 2009,,the IMF issued those extran250 billion dollars --,because it servednas a collective global action,that safeguarded countriesnlarge and small in one fell swoop. 
 But here --,here's the intriguing part.,More than half of those extra SDRsnthat were printed in 2009 --,150 billion dollars' worth --,went to developed market countriesnwho, for the most part,,have a modest neednfor these foreign exchange reserves,,because they have flexible exchange rates.,So those extra reservesnthat were printed in 2009,,in the end, for developednmarket countries at least,,weren't really needed.,And they remain unused today. 
 So here's an idea.,As a first step,,why don't we startnspending those unused,,those extra SDRsnthat were printed in 2009,,to combat climate change? 
 They could, for example,,be used to buy bonds issuednby the UN's Green Climate Fund.,This was a fund created in 2009,,following that climatenagreement in Copenhagen.,And it was designed to channel fundsntowards developing countries,to meet their climate projects.,It's been one of the mostnsuccessful funds of its type,,raising almost 10 billion dollars.,But if we use those extranSDRs that were issued,,it helps governments get back on track,,to meet that promisenof 100 billion dollars a year,that was derailed by the financial crisis. 
 It could also --,it could also serve as a test case.,If the inflationary consequencesnof using SDRs in this way are benign,,it could be used to justify,the additional, extra issuancenof SDRs, say, every five years,,again, with the commitment,that developed-market countriesnwould direct their share,of the new reserves,to the Green Climate Fund. 
 Printing international moneynin this way has several advantages,over printing national currencies.,The first is it's really easy to argue,that spending money to mitigatenclimate change benefits everyone.,No one section of society benefitsnfrom the printing press over another.,That problem of competingnclaims is mitigated.,It's also fair to say,that because it takes so many countriesnto agree to issue these extra SDRs,,it's highly unlikely that money printingnwould get out of control.,What you end up withnis a collective, global action,aimed -- and it's controllednglobal action --,aimed at a global good.,And,,as we've learnednwith the money-printing schemes,,whatever concerns we havencan be allayed by rules. 
 So, for example,,the issuance of these extra SDRsnevery five years could be capped,,such that this international currencynis never more than five percent,of global foreign exchange reserves.,That's important because it would allay,well, let's say, the ridiculousnconcerns that the US might have,that the SDR could ever challengenthe dollar's dominant role,in international finance.,And in fact,,I think the only thing that the SDRnwould likely steal from the dollar,under this scheme,is its nickname, the "greenback.",Because even with that cap in place,,the IMF could havenfollowed up its issuance --,its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --,with a further 200 billionndollars of SDRs in 2014. 
 So hypothetically,,that would mean that developed countriesncould have contributed,up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs,to the Green Climate Fund.,That's 30 times what it has today.,And you know,,as spectacular as that sounds,,it's only just beginning to looknlike "whatever it takes." 
 And just to think what amazing thingsncould be done with that money,,consider this:,in 2009,,Norway promised one billion dollarsnof its reserves to Brazil,if they followed throughnon their goals on deforestation.,That program has since deliveredna 70 percent reduction in deforestation,in the past decade.,That's saving 3.2 billion tonsnof carbon dioxide emissions,,which is the equivalent of takingnall American cars off the roads,for three whole years.,So what could we do,with 300 other pay-for-performancenclimate projects like that,,organized on a global scale?,We could take cars off the roadsnfor a generation. 
 So,,let's not quibble about whether we cannafford to fund climate change.,The real question is:,Do we care enough about future generations,to take the very same policy risksnwe took to save the financial system?,After all,,we could do it,,we did do it,and we are doing it today. 
 We must, must, must don"whatever it takes." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Carlos,,the Vietnam vet Marine,who volunteered for three toursnand got shot up in every one.,In 1971, he was medically retired,because he had so muchnshrapnel in his body,that he was setting off metal detectors.,For the next 42 years,nhe suffered from nightmares,,extreme anxiety in public,,isolation, depression.,He self-medicated with alcohol.,He was married and divorced three times.,Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 Now, I became a psychologistnto help mitigate human suffering,,and for the past 10 years, my targetnhas been the suffering caused by PTSD,,as experienced by veterans like Carlos.,Until recently, the science of PTSDnjust wasn't there.,And so, we didn't know what to do.,We put some veterans on heavy drugs.,Others we hospitalizednand gave generic group therapy,,and others still we simply said to them,,"Just go home and try to forgetnabout your experiences.",More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,nwilderness retreats --,many things which mayntemporarily relieve stress,,but which don't actually eliminatenPTSD symptoms over the long term. 
 But things have changed.,And I am here to tell younthat we can now eliminate PTSD,,not just manage the symptoms,,and in huge numbers of veterans.,Because new scientific researchnhas been able to show,,objectively, repeatedly,,which treatments actuallynget rid of symptoms and which do not. 
 Now as it turns out,,the best treatments for PTSD usenmany of the very same training principles,that the military usesnin preparing its trainees for war. 
 Now, making war --,this is something that we are good at.,We humans have been making warnsince before we were even fully human.,And since then, we have gonenfrom using stone and sinew,to developing the most sophisticatednand devastating weapon systems imaginable.,And to enable our warriorsnto use these weapons,,we employ the most cutting-edgentraining methods.,We are good at making war.,And we are good at trainingnour warriors to fight. 
 Yet, when we consider the experiencenof the modern-day combat veteran,,we begin to see that wenhave not been as good,at preparing them to come home.,Why is that?,Well, our ancestors livednimmersed in conflict,,and they fought right where they lived.,So until only very recentlynin our evolutionary history,,there was hardly a need to learnnhow to come home from war,,because we never really did.,But thankfully, today,,most of humanity livesnin far more peaceful societies,,and when there is conflict,nwe, especially in the United States,,now have the technology to putnour warriors through advanced training,,drop them in to fightnanywhere on the globe,and when they're done,,jet them back to peacetime suburbia. 
 But just imagine for a momentnwhat this must feel like.,I've spoken with veterans who've told me,that one day they're in a brutalnfirefight in Afghanistan,where they saw carnage and death,,and just three days later,nthey found themselves,toting an ice chestnto their kid's soccer game.,"Mindfuck" is the most common term. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's the most common termnI've heard to describe that experience.,And that's exactly what that is.,Because while our warriorsnspend countless hours training for war,,we've only recently come to understand,that many require trainingnon how to return to civilian life. 
 Now, like any training, the bestnPTSD treatments require repetition.,In the military,,we don't simply hand traineesnMark-19 automatic grenade launchers,and say, "Here's the trigger,nhere's some ammo and good luck.",No. We train them, on the rangenand in specific contexts,,over and over and over,until lifting their weaponnand engaging their target,is so engrained into muscle memory,that it can be performednwithout even thinking,,even under the most stressfulnconditions you can imagine. 
 Now, the same holdsnfor training-based treatments.,The first of these treatmentsnis cognitive therapy,,and this is a kindnof mental recalibration.,When veterans come home from war,,their way of mentally framingnthe world is calibrated,to an immenselynmore dangerous environment.,So when you try to overlay that mind framenonto a peacetime environment,,you get problems.,You begin drowning in worriesnabout dangers that aren't present.,You begin not trusting family or friends.,Which is not to say there are nondangers in civilian life; there are.,It's just that the probabilitynof encountering them,compared to combat,is astronomically lower. 
 So we never advise veteransnto turn off caution completely.,We do train them, however,nto adjust caution,according to where they are.,If you find yourselfnin a bad neighborhood,,you turn it up.,Out to dinner with family?,You turn it way down.,We train veterans to be fiercely rational,,to systematically gaugenthe actual statistical probability,of encountering, say, an IEDnhere in peacetime America.,With enough practice,nthose recalibrations stick. 
 The next of these treatmentsnis exposure therapy,,and this is a kind of field training,,and the fastest of the provenneffective treatments out there. 
 You remember Carlos?,This was the treatment that he chose.,And so we started offnby giving him exercises,,for him, challenging ones:,going to a grocery store,,going to a shopping mall,ngoing to a restaurant,,sitting with his back to the door.,And, critically --,staying in these environments.,Now, at first he was very anxious.,He wanted to sitnwhere he could scan the room,,where he could plan escape routes,,where he could get his handsnon a makeshift weapon.,And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.,He remembered his trainingnin the Marine Corps,,and he pushed through his discomfort.,And every time he did this,nhis anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,,and then a little bit morenand then a little bit more,,until in the end,,he had effectively relearnednhow to sit in a public space,and just enjoy himself. 
 He also listened to recordingsnof his combat experiences,,over and over and over.,He listened until those memoriesnno longer generated any anxiety.,He processed his memories so much,that his brain no longer needednto return to those experiences,in his sleep.,And when I spoke with himna year after treatment had finished,,he told me,,"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years,that I haven't had nightmares." 
 Now, this is differentnthan erasing a memory.,Veterans will always rememberntheir traumatic experiences,,but with enough practice,,those memories are no longer as rawnor as painful as they once were.,They don't feel emotionallynlike they just happened yesterday,,and that is an immenselynbetter place to be. 
 But it's often difficult.,And, like any training,nit may not work for everybody.,And there are trust issues.,Sometimes I'm asked,,"If you haven't been there, Doc,nhow can you help me?",Which is understandable.,But at the point of returningnto civilian life,,you do not requirensomebody who's been there.,You don't require trainingnfor operations on the battlefield;,you require training on how to come home. 
 For the past 10 years of my work,,I have been exposed to detailed accounts,of the worst experiencesnthat you can imagine,,daily.,And it hasn't always been easy.,There have been timesnwhere I have just felt my heart break,or that I've absorbed too much.,But these training-basedntreatments work so well,,that whatever this work takes out of me,nit puts back even more,,because I see people get better.,I see people's lives transform. 
 Carlos can now enjoy outingsnwith his grandchildren,,which is something he couldn't even donwith his own children.,And what's amazing to menis that after 43 years of suffering,,it only took him 10 weeksnof intense training to get his life back.,And when I spoke with him, he told me,,"I know that I can't get those years back.,But at least now, whatever daysnthat I have left on this Earth,,I can live them in peace.",He also said, "I hope that thesenyounger veterans don't wait,to get the help they need.",And that's my hope, too.,Because ...,this life is short,,and if you are fortunate enoughnto have survived war,or any kind of traumatic experience,,you owe it to yourselfnto live your life well.,And you shouldn't waitnto get the training you need,to make that happen. 
 Now, the best way of endingnhuman suffering caused by war,is to never go to war.,But we are just not therenyet as a species.,Until we are,,the mental suffering that we createnin our sons and in our daughters,when we send them off to fight,can be alleviated.,But we must ensure that the science,nthe energy level, the value,that we place on sending them off to war,is at the very least mirrored,in how well we prepare themnto come back home to us.,This much, we owe them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)War has been a part of my lifensince I can remember.,I was born in Afghanistan,njust six months after the Soviets invaded,,and even though I was too youngnto understand what was happening,,I had a deep sense of the sufferingnand the fear around me. 
 Those early experiences had a major impactnon how I now think about war and conflict.,I learned that when peoplenhave a fundamental issue at stake,,for most of them,,giving in is not an option.,For these types conflicts --,when people's rights are violated,,when their countries are occupied,,when they're oppressed and humiliated --,they need a powerful waynto resist and to fight back.,Which means that no matter how destructivenand terrible violence is,,if people see it as their only choice,,they will use it.,Most of us are concernednwith the level of violence in the world.,But we're not going to end war,by telling peoplenthat violence is morally wrong.,Instead, we must offer them a tool,that's at least as powerfulnand as effective as violence. 
 This is the work I do.,For the past 13 years,,I've been teaching people,in some of the most difficultnsituations around the world,how they can use nonviolentnstruggle to conduct conflict.,Most people associate this type of actionnwith Gandhi and Martin Luther King.,But people have been usingnnonviolent action for thousands of years.,In fact, most of the rightsnthat we have today in this country --,as women,,as minorities,,as workers,,as people of different sexual orientations,and citizens concernednwith the environment --,these rights weren't handed to us.,They were won by peoplenwho fought for them,and who sacrificed for them.,But because we haven't learnednfrom this history,,nonviolent struggle as a techniquenis widely misunderstood. 
 I met recently with a groupnof Ethiopian activists,,and they told me somethingnthat I hear a lot.,They said they'd alreadyntried nonviolent action,,and it hadn't worked.,Years ago they held a protest.,The government arrested everyone,nand that was the end of that.,The idea that nonviolent strugglenis equivalent to street protests,is a real problem.,Because although protests can be a greatnway to show that people want change,,on their own, they don'tnactually create change --,at least change that is fundamental. 
 (Laughter) 
 Powerful opponents are not going to givenpeople what they want,just because they asked nicely ...,or even not so nicely. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nonviolent struggle worksnby destroying an opponent,,not physically,,but by identifying the institutionsnthat an opponent needs to survive,,and then denying themnthose sources of power.,Nonviolent activistsncan neutralize the military,by causing soldiers to defect.,They can disrupt the economynthrough strikes and boycotts.,And they can challengengovernment propaganda,by creating alternative media. 
 There are a variety of methodsnthat can be used to do this.,My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,,has identified 198 methodsnof nonviolent action.,And protest is only one.,Let me give you a recent example. 
 Until a few months ago,,Guatemala was rulednby corrupt former military officials,with ties to organized crime.,People were generally aware of this,,but most of them felt powerlessnto do anything about it --,until one group of citizens,njust 12 regular people,,put out a call on Facebooknto their friends,to meet in the central plaza,nholding signs with a message:,"Renuncia YA" --,resign already.,To their surprise,,30,000 people showed up.,They stayed there for monthsnas protests spread throughout the country.,At one point,,the organizers delivered hundreds of eggsnto various government buildings,with a message:,"If you don't have the huevos" --,the balls --,"to stop corrupt candidatesnfrom running for office,,you can borrow ours." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 President Molina responded,by vowing that he would never step down.,And the activists realizednthat they couldn't just keep protesting,and ask the president to resign.,They needed to leave him no choice.,So they organized a general strike,,in which people throughoutnthe country refused to work.,In Guatemala City alone,,over 400 businessesnand schools shut their doors.,Meanwhile,,farmers throughout the countrynblocked major roads.,Within five days,,the president,,along with dozens of otherngovernment officials,,resigned already. 
 (Applause) 
 I've been greatly inspired,by the creativity and braverynof people using nonviolent action,in nearly every country in the world.,For example,,recently a group of activists in Uganda,released a crate of pigs in the streets.,You can see here that the policenare confused about what to do with them. 
 (Laughter) 
 The pigs were paintednthe color of the ruling party.,One pig was even wearing a hat,,a hat that people recognized. 
 (Laughter) 
 Activists around the worldnare getting better at grabbing headlines,,but these isolated actions do very little,if they're not part of a larger strategy.,A general wouldn't marchnhis troops into battle,unless he had a plan to win the war.,Yet this is how most of the world'snnonviolent movements operate.,Nonviolent struggle is just as complexnas military warfare,,if not more.,Its participants must be well-trainednand have clear objectives,,and its leaders must have a strategynof how to achieve those objectives. 
 The technique of war has been developednover thousands of years,with massive resources,and some of our best mindsndedicated to understanding,and improving how it works.,Meanwhile, nonviolent strugglenis rarely systematically studied,,and even though the number is growing,,there are still only a few dozen peoplenin the world who are teaching it.,This is dangerous,,because we now know that our oldnapproaches of dealing with conflict,are not adequate for the newnchallenges that we're facing. 
 The US government recently admitted,that it's in a stalematenin its war against ISIS.,But what most people don't know,is that people have stood up to ISISnusing nonviolent action.,When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,,they announced that they were puttingnin place a new public school curriculum,,based on their own extremist ideology.,But on the first day of school,,not a single child showed up.,Parents simply refused to send them.,They told journalists they would rathernhomeschool their children,than to have them brainwashed. 
 This is an examplenof just one act of defiance,in just one city.,But what if it was coordinated,with the dozens of other actsnof nonviolent resistance,that have taken place against ISIS?,What if the parents' boycottnwas part of a larger strategy,to identify and cut off the resourcesnthat ISIS needs to function;,the skilled labor needed to produce food;,the engineers needednto extract and refine oil;,the media infrastructurenand communications networks,and transportation systems,,and the local businessesnthat ISIS relies on?,It may be difficultnto imagine defeating ISIS,with action that is nonviolent.,But it's time we challengenthe way we think about conflict,and the choices we have in facing it. 
 Here's an idea worth spreading:,let's learn more about wherennonviolent action has worked,and how we can make it more powerful,,just like we do with othernsystems and technologies,that are constantly being refinednto better meet human needs.,It may be that we can improvennonviolent action,to a point where it is increasinglynused in place of war.,Violence as a tool of conflictncould then be abandoned,in the same way that bows and arrows were,,because we have replaced themnwith weapons that are more effective.,With human innovation, we can makennonviolent struggle more powerful,than the newest and latestntechnologies of war.,The greatest hope for humanitynlies not in condemning violence,but in making violence obsolete. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Thank you very much. Good evening. 
 Some of you may have noticednthat my last name is Nutt.,And if you did,nyou are forgiven for wondering,how a Nutt managednto end up in a war zone.,I actually was offered, right outnof medical school, and accepted,a volunteer contract to worknwith UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,,that was worth one dollar.,And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar,in the event that the UN needednto issue an evacuation order,,so that I would be covered.,I was, after all, heading into onenof the world's most dangerous places.,And by now, some of younmay be asking yourselves,,and I just want to reassure you,,that I did get half the money up front. 
 (Laughter) 
 But you see, this is how,nwith 50 cents in my pocket,,I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.,Journalists called it the "city of death.",And they called it the city of death,because 300,000 peoplenhad lost their lives there --,300,000 people,,mostly as a resultnof war-related famine and disease. 
 I was part of a team that was taskednwith trying to figure out,how best to respondnto this humanitarian catastrophe.,It was right on the heelsnof the Rwandan genocide,,and aid money to the region was drying up.,Many aid organizations, unfortunately,,had been forced to close their doors.,And so the question that I was askednto specifically help answer,,which is one that aid workers asknthemselves in war zones the world over,,is: What the hell do we do now?,You know, the security environmentnin Somalia at that moment in time --,and nothing has really changed too much --,can best be described as "Mad Max"nby way of "A Clockwork Orange." 
 And I remember very distinctlyna couple of days after my arrival,,I went up to a feeding clinic.,There were dozens of womennwho were standing in line,,and they were clutchingntheir infants very close.,About 20 minutes intonthis conversation I was having,with this one young woman,,I leaned forward,and tried to put my fingernin the palm of her baby's hand.,And when I did this,,I discovered that her babynwas already in rigor.,She was stiff,,and her little, lifeless handnwas curled into itself.,She had died hours before,of malnutrition and dehydration.,I later learnednthat as her baby was dying,,this young woman hadnbeen held for two days,by some teenage boys who were armednwith Kalashnikov rifles,,and they were tryingnto shake her down for more money,,money she very clearly did not have.,And this is a scene that I have confronted,in war zones the world over;,places where kids, some as youngnas eight -- they are this big --,and those kids, they havennever been to school.,But they have fought and they have killednwith automatic rifles. 
 Is this just the way the world is?,Some will you tell younthat war is unavoidably human.,After all, it is as oldnas existence itself.,We say never again, and yet it happensnagain and again and again.,But I will tell younthat I have seen the absolute worst,of what we as human beingsnare capable of doing to one another,,and yet I still believena different outcome is possible.,Do you want to know why?,Because over 20 years of doing this work,,going in and out of war zonesnaround the world,,I have come to understand,that there are aspects of this problem,that we, all of us, as peoplenoccupying this shared space,,that we can change --,not through force or coercion or invasion,,but by simply looking at allnof the options available to us,and choosing the ones that favornpeace at the expense of war,,instead of war at the expense of peace. 
 How so?,Well, I want you to consider this:,there are at least 800 millionnsmall arms and light weapons,in circulation in the world today.,The vast majority of civilians,nlike that young baby,,who are dying in war zonesnaround the world,,are dying at the handsnof various armed groups,who rely on a near-infinite supplynof cheap, easy and efficient weapons,to rape, threaten, intimidatenand brutalize those civilians,at every turn.,How cheap?,Well, in some parts of the world,,you can buy an AK-47nfor as little as 10 dollars.,In many places in which I have worked,,it is easier to get accessnto an automatic rifle,than it is to get accessnto clean drinking water. 
 And so now the important part:,Can anything be done about this?,To answer that question,,let's take a looknat this map of the world.,And now, let's add in all of the countriesnthat are currently at war,,and the number of peoplenwho have either died,or have been displacednas a result of that violence.,It is a staggering number --,more than 40 million people.,But you will also noticensomething else about this map.,You will noticenthat most of those countries,are in the Global South.,Now, let's look at the countries,that are the world's top 20 exportersnof small arms in the world.,And what do we notice?,Well, you see them in green.,You will notice that those are mostlyncountries in the Global North,,primarily Western countries.,What does this tell us?,This tells us that most of the peoplenwho are dying in war,are living in poor countries,,and yet most of the peoplenwho are profiting from war,are living in rich countries --npeople like you and me. 
 And then what if we gonbeyond small arms for a second.,What if we look at all weaponsnin circulation in the world?,Who does the biggest business?,Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons,come from none othernthan the five permanent members,of the United Nations Security Council,,plus Germany.,It's shocking, isn't it? 
 Now, some of you might be sayingnat this moment in time,,"Oh yeah, but OK,nhang on a second there ... Nutt." 
 (Laughter) 
 Grade school was spectacular for me.,It was, really, a wonderful experience. 
 (Laughter) 
 But you might be saying to yourselves,,You know, all of these weaponsnin war zones -- they're not a cause,,but an effect of the violencenthat plagues them,each and every single day.,You know, places like Iraqnand Afghanistan,,where they need these weaponsnto be able to maintain law and order,,promote peace and security,nto combat terror groups --,surely this is a good thing. 
 Let's take a look at that assumptionnfor just one moment,,because you see there has beenna boom in the small-arms trade,since the start of the War on Terror.,In fact, it is a businessnthat has grown threefold,over the past 15 years.,And now let's compare thatnto the number of people,who have directly diednin armed conflict around the world,in that same period.,What do you notice?,Well, you notice that, in fact,nthat also goes up,roughly three- to fourfold.,They basically go upnand end at the same point. 
 Now, we can have a circular argument here,about whether this increasenin fatalities is a response,to the increase of small arms,nor the other way around.,But here's what we shouldnreally take away from this.,What we should take away from this,is that this is a relationshipnworth scrutinizing,,especially when you considernthat small arms that were shipped to Iraq,for use by the Iraqi Army,,or to Syria for so-callednmoderate opposition fighters,,that those arms, many of them,nare now in the hands of ISIS;,or when you consider that armsnthat were shipped to Libya,are now actively driftingnacross the Sahel,,and ending up with groupsnlike Boko Haram and al Qaeda,and other militant groups. 
 And therein lies the problem.,Because, you see,,small arms anywherenare a menace everywhere,,because their first stopnis rarely their last. 
 Spending on war per person per year,now amounts to about 249 dollars --,249 dollars per person,,which is roughly 12 timesnwhat we spend on foreign aid,,money that is used to educatenand vaccinate children,and combat malnutritionnin the Global South.,But we can shift that balance.,How do we do this?,Well, it is essentially a problemnof both supply and demand,,so we can tackle it from both sides. 
 On the supply side,,we can push our governments,to adopt international armsntransparency mechanisms,like the Arms Trade Treaty,,which makes it so that rich countriesnhave to be more accountable,for where their arms are going,and what their arms might be used for.,Here in the United States,,the largest arms-exporting countrynin the world by far,,President Obama has rightly signednthe Arms Trade Treaty,,but none of it takes effect,nit isn't binding,,until it is approvednand ratified by the Senate.,This is where we neednto make our voices heard.,You know, the curbing of small arms --,it's not going to solventhe problem of war.,Increased control mechanismsnwon't solve that problem.,But it's an important stepnin the right direction.,And it's up to all of usnwho live in those rich countries,to make change here. 
 What about on the demand side?,You know, there are generationsnaround the world,who are being lost to war.,It is possible to disruptnthat cycle of violence,with investments in education,nin strengthening the rule of law,and in economic development,nespecially for women.,I have personally seen,just how incredibly powerfulnthose kinds of efforts can be,around the world. 
 But here's the thing:,they take time,,which means for you as individuals,nif you want to give,,please, by all means do it.,But know that how you givenis just as important,as how much you give.,Regular contributionsnlike monthly contributions,are a far more effective way of giving,,because they allownhumanitarian organizations,to properly plan and be investednover the long term,,and to be present in the lives of familiesnwho have been affected by war,,wars that many of us, frankly,nall too quickly forget. 
 When I first got on that planenfor Somalia as a young doctor,,I had no idea what it meantnto live with war.,But I can tell you that I knownwhat it means now.,And I know what it means,to lie in bed in the pitch-black night,and listen to that hauntingn"pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!",of automatic gunfire,,and wonder with absolute dread,how many minutes I have leftnuntil it will be right on top of me.,I can tell you that it is a terrifyingnand agonizing fear,,one that millions of peoplenaround the world are forced to confront,each and every single day,,especially children.,Over the years of doing this work,,unfortunately, war has killednfar too many people close to me.,And on at least a couple of occasions,,war has very nearly killed me as well. 
 But I firmly believe,,which is why I get up and donwhat I do every single day,,that we can make different choices here.,Because you see, war is ours,,as human beings.,We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.,We are thereforennot powerless to solve it.,On the contrary,,we are the only ones who can. 
 Thank you very much, and I wantnto wish you the greatest success. 
 (Applause)I worked as a war reporter for 15 years,before I realizednthat I really had a problem.,There was something really wrong with me. 
 This was about a year before 9/11,nand America wasn't at war yet.,We weren't talking about PTSD.,We were not yet talkingnabout the effect of trauma and war,on the human psyche.,I'd been in Afghanistannfor a couple of months,with the Northern Alliancenas they were fighting the Taliban.,And at that point the Talibannhad an air force,,they had fighter planes,nthey had tanks, they had artillery,,and we really got hammerednpretty badly a couple of times.,We saw some very ugly things.,But I didn't really think it affected me.,I didn't think much about it. 
 I came home to New York, where I live.,Then one day I went down into the subway,,and for the first time in my life,,I knew real fear.,I had a massive panic attack.,I was way more scarednthan I had ever been in Afghanistan.,Everything I was looking at seemed likenit was going to kill me,,but I couldn't explain why.,The trains were going too fast.,There were too many people.,The lights were too bright.,Everything was too loud,neverything was moving too quickly.,I backed up against a support columnnand just waited for it.,When I couldn't take it any longer,nI ran out of the subway station,and walked wherever I was going. 
 Later, I found out that what I hadnwas short-term PTSD:,post-traumatic stress disorder.,We evolved as animals, as primates,nto survive periods of danger,,and if your life has been in danger,,you want to react to unfamiliar noises.,You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.,You want to have nightmares and flashbacks,of the thing that could kill you.,You want to be angry because it makes younpredisposed to fight,,or depressed, because it keeps you outnof circulation a little bit.,Keeps you safe.,It's not very pleasant,nbut it's better than getting eaten. 
 Most people recovernfrom that pretty quickly.,It takes a few weeks, a few months.,I kept having panic attacks,nbut they eventually went away.,I had no idea it was connectednto the war that I'd seen.,I just thought I was going crazy,,and then I thought, well,nnow I'm not going crazy anymore. 
 About 20 percent of people, however,,wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.,They are not adapted to temporary danger.,They are maladapted for everyday life,,unless they get help.,We know that the peoplenwho are vulnerable to long-term PTSD,are people who were abused as children,,who suffered trauma as children,,people who have low education levels,,people who have psychiatricndisorders in their family.,If you served in Vietnam,and your brother is schizophrenic,,you're way more likely to getnlong-term PTSD from Vietnam. 
 So I started to study thisnas a journalist,,and I realized that there was somethingnreally strange going on.,The numbers seemed to be goingnin the wrong direction.,Every war that we havenfought as a country,,starting with the Civil War,,the intensity of the combat has gone down.,As a result, the casualty ratesnhave gone down.,But disability rates have gone up.,They should be goingnin the same direction,,but they're going in different directions. 
 The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistannhave produced, thank God,,a casualty rate about one thirdnof what it was in Vietnam.,But they've also created --,they've also producednthree times the disability rates.,Around 10 percent of the US militarynis actively engaged in combat,,10 percent or under.,They're shooting at people,nkilling people,,getting shot at,nseeing their friends get killed.,It's incredibly traumatic.,But it's only about 10 percentnof our military.,But about half of our military has filed,for some kind of PTSD compensationnfrom the government. 
 And suicide doesn't even fit into thisnin a very logical way.,We've all heard the tragic statisticnof 22 vets a day, on average,,in this country, killing themselves.,Most people don't realize,that the majority of those suicidesnare veterans of the Vietnam War,,that generation,,and their decision to take their own livesnactually might not be related,to the war they fought 50 years earlier.,In fact, there's no statistical connectionnbetween combat and suicide.,If you're in the militarynand you're in a lot of combat,,you're no more likely to kill yourselfnthan if you weren't.,In fact, one study found,that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,,you're actually slightly less likelynto commit suicide later. 
 I studied anthropology in college.,I did my fieldworknon the Navajo reservation.,I wrote a thesis on Navajonlong-distance runners.,And recently, whilenI was researching PTSD,,I had this thought.,I thought back to the worknI did when I was young,,and I thought, I bet the Navajo,nthe Apache, the Comanche --,I mean, these are very warlike nations --,I bet they weren't gettingnPTSD like we do.,When their warriors came backnfrom fighting the US military,or fighting each other,,I bet they pretty much just slippednright back into tribal life. 
 And maybe what determines,the rate of long-term PTSD,isn't what happened out there,,but the kind of society you come back to.,And maybe if you come backnto a close, cohesive, tribal society,,you can get over trauma pretty quickly.,And if you come backnto an alienating, modern society,,you might remain traumatizednyour entire life.,In other words, maybe the problemnisn't them, the vets;,maybe the problem is us. 
 Certainly, modern societynis hard on the human psyche,by every metric that we have.,As wealth goes up in a society,,the suicide rate goes up instead of down.,If you live in modern society,,you're up to eight times more likely,to suffer from depression in your lifetime,than if you live in a poor,nagrarian society.,Modern society has probably producednthe highest rates of suicide,and depression and anxietynand loneliness and child abuse,ever in human history.,I saw one study,that compared women in Nigeria,,one of the most chaoticnand violent and corrupt,and poorest countries in Africa,,to women in North America.,And the highest rates of depressionnwere urban women in North America.,That was also the wealthiest group. 
 So let's go back to the US military.,Ten percent are in combat.,Around 50 percent have filednfor PTSD compensation.,So about 40 percent of veteransnreally were not traumatized overseas,but have come home to discovernthey are dangerously alienated,and depressed.,So what is happening with them?,What's going on with those people,,the phantom 40 percent that are troublednbut don't understand why? 
 Maybe it's this:,maybe they had an experiencenof sort of tribal closeness,in their unit when they were overseas.,They were eating together,nsleeping together,,doing tasks and missions together.,They were trusting each othernwith their lives.,And then they come home,and they have to give all that up,and they're coming backnto a society, a modern society,,which is hard on peoplenwho weren't even in the military.,It's just hard on everybody. 
 And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.,But for a lot of these people,,maybe it's not trauma.,I mean, certainly,nsoldiers are traumatized,and the ones who arenhave to be treated for that.,But a lot of them --,maybe what's bothering themnis actually a kind of alienation.,I mean, maybe we just haventhe wrong word for some of it,,and just changing our language,nour understanding,,would help a little bit.,"Post-deployment alienation disorder.",Maybe even just calling it thatnfor some of these people,would allow them to stop imagining,trying to imagine a traumanthat didn't really happen,in order to explain a feelingnthat really is happening.,And in fact, it's an extremelyndangerous feeling.,That alienation and depressionncan lead to suicide.,These people are in danger.,It's very important to understand why. 
 The Israeli military has a PTSD ratenof around one percent.,The theory is that everyone in Israelnis supposed to serve in the military.,When soldiers come backnfrom the front line,,they're not going from a militarynenvironment to a civilian environment.,They're coming back to a communitynwhere everyone understands,about the military.,Everyone's been in itnor is going to be in it.,Everyone understandsnthe situation they're all in.,It's as if they're all in one big tribe. 
 We know that if you take a lab rat,and traumatize it and put itnin a cage by itself,,you can maintain its trauma symptomsnalmost indefinitely.,And if you take that same lab ratnand put it in a cage with other rats,,after a couple of weeks,nit's pretty much OK. 
 After 9/11,,the murder rate in New York Citynwent down by 40 percent.,The suicide rate went down.,The violent crime rate in New Yorknwent down after 9/11.,Even combat veterans of previous warsnwho suffered from PTSD,said that their symptoms went downnafter 9/11 happened.,The reason is that if you traumatizenan entire society,,we don't fall apartnand turn on one another.,We come together. We unify.,Basically, we tribalize,,and that process of unifyingnfeels so good and is so good for us,,that it even helps people,who are strugglingnwith mental health issues.,During the blitz in London,,admissions to psychiatric wardsnwent down during the bombings. 
 For a while, that was the kind of country,that American soldiers camenback to -- a unified country.,We were sticking together.,We were trying to understandnthe threat against us.,We were trying to helpnourselves and the world.,But that's changed.,Now, American soldiers,,American veterans are coming backnto a country that is so bitterly divided,that the two political partiesnare literally accusing each other,of treason, of beingnan enemy of the state,,of trying to undermine the securitynand the welfare of their own country.,The gap between rich and poornis the biggest it's ever been.,It's just getting worse.,Race relations are terrible.,There are demonstrationsnand even riots in the streets,because of racial injustice.,And veterans know that any tribenthat treated itself that way -- in fact,,any platoon that treated itselfnthat way -- would never survive.,We've gotten used to it.,Veterans have gone awaynand are coming back,and seeing their own countrynwith fresh eyes.,And they see what's going on.,This is the country they fought for.,No wonder they're depressed.,No wonder they're scared. 
 Sometimes, we ask ourselvesnif we can save the vets.,I think the real questionnis if we can save ourselves.,If we can,,I think the vets are going to be fine.,It's time for this country to unite,,if only to help the men and womennwho fought to protect us. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)When I was seven years old,,some well-meaning adult asked menwhat I wanted to be when I grew up.,Proudly, I said: "An artist.","No, you don't," he said,,"You can't make a living being an artist!" 
 My little seven-year-oldnPicasso dreams were crushed.,But I gathered myself,,went off in search of a new dream,,eventually settling on being a scientist,,perhaps something likenthe next Albert Einstein. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have always loved math and science,,later, coding.,And so I decided to studyncomputer programming in college.,In my junior year,,my computer graphics professornshowed us these wonderful short films.,It was the first computer animationnany of us had ever seen.,I watched these filmsnin wonder, transfixed,,fireworks going off in my head,,thinking, "That is whatnI want to do with my life.",The idea that all the math, sciencenand code I had been learning,could come together to createnthese worlds and characters,and stories I connected with,,was pure magic for me. 
 Just two years later, I started working,at the place that made those films,nPixar Animation Studios.,It was here I learned hownwe actually execute those films.,To create our movies,,we create a three-dimensionalnworld inside the computer.,We start with a point that makesna line that makes a face,that creates characters,,or trees and rocksnthat eventually become a forest.,And because it'sna three-dimensional world,,we can move a cameranaround inside that world.,I was fascinated by all of it.,But then I got my first taste of lighting. 
 Lighting in practice is placing lightsninside this three-dimensional world.,I actually have icons of lightsnI move around in there.,Here you can see I've added a light,,I'm turning on the rough versionnof lighting in our software,,turn on shadows,and placing the light.,As I place a light,,I think about what it mightnlook like in real life,,but balance that out with what we neednartistically and for the story.,So it might look like this at first,,but as we adjust this and move that,in weeks of work,,in rough form it might look like this,,and in final form, like this. 
 There's this moment in lightingnthat made me fall utterly in love with it.,It's where we go from this,to this.,It's the moment wherenall the pieces come together,,and suddenly the world comes to life,as if it's an actual place that exists.,This moment never gets old,,especially for that little seven-year-oldngirl that wanted to be an artist. 
 As I learned to light,,I learned about using lightnto help tell story,,to set the time of day,,to create the mood,,to guide the audience's eye,,how to make a character look appealing,or stand out in a busy set. 
 Did you see WALL-E? 
 (Laughter) 
 There he is. 
 As you can see,,we can create any world that we wantninside the computer.,We can make a world with monsters,,with robots that fall in love,,we can even make pigs fly. 
 (Laughter) 
 While this is an incredible thing,,this untethered artistic freedom,,it can create chaos.,It can create unbelievable worlds,,unbelievable movement,,things that are jarring to the audience. 
 So to combat this, we tethernourselves with science.,We use science and the world we know,as a backbone,,to ground ourselves in somethingnrelatable and recognizable.,"Finding Nemo" is an excellentnexample of this.,A major portion of the movientakes place underwater.,But how do you make it look underwater? 
 In early research and development,,we took a clip of underwater footagenand recreated it in the computer.,Then we broke it back down,to see which elements make upnthat underwater look.,One of the most critical elements,was how the light travelsnthrough the water.,So we coded up a lightnthat mimics this physics --,first, the visibility of the water,,and then what happens with the color.,Objects close to the eyenhave their full, rich colors.,As light travels deeper into the water,,we lose the red wavelengths,,then the green wavelengths,,leaving us with blue at the far depths. 
 In this clip you can seentwo other important elements.,The first is the surge and swell,,or the invisible underwater current,that pushes the bits of particulatenaround in the water.,The second is the caustics.,These are the ribbons of light,,like you might seenon the bottom of a pool,,that are created when the sunnbends through the crests,of the ripples and wavesnon the ocean's surface.,Here we have the fog beams.,These give us color depth cues,,but also tells which direction is up,in shots where we don'tnsee the water surface.,The other really cool thingnyou can see here,is that we lit that particulatenonly with the caustics,,so that as it goes in and outnof those ribbons of light,,it appears and disappears,,lending a subtle, magicalnsparkle to the underwater. 
 You can see how we're using the science --,the physics of water,nlight and movement --,to tether that artistic freedom.,But we are not beholden to it.,We considered each of these elements,and which ones had to benscientifically accurate,and which ones we could push and pullnto suit the story and the mood. 
 We realized early on that colornwas one we had some leeway with.,So here's a traditionally colorednunderwater scene.,But here, we can take Sydney Harbornand push it fairly green,to suit the sad mood of what's happening.,In this scene, it's really importantnwe see deep into the underwater,,so we understand whatnthe East Australian Current is,,that the turtles are diving intonand going on this roller coaster ride.,So we pushed the visibility of the water,well past anything you wouldnever see in real life.,Because in the end,,we are not trying to recreatenthe scientifically correct real world,,we're trying to create a believable world,,one the audience can immersenthemselves in to experience the story. 
 We use science to creatensomething wonderful.,We use story and artistic touchnto get us to a place of wonder.,This guy, WALL-E, is a greatnexample of that.,He finds beauty in the simplest things.,But when he came in to lighting,nwe knew we had a big problem.,We got so geeked-out on makingnWALL-E this convincing robot,,that we made his binocularsnpractically optically perfect. 
 (Laughter) 
 His binoculars are one of the mostncritical acting devices he has.,He doesn't have a face or evenntraditional dialogue, for that matter.,So the animators were heavilyndependent on the binoculars,to sell his acting and emotions. 
 We started lighting and we realized,the triple lenses inside his binocularsnwere a mess of reflections.,He was starting to look glassy-eyed. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, glassy-eyednis a fundamentally awful thing,when you are tryingnto convince an audience,that a robot has a personalitynand he's capable of falling in love.,So we went to work on these opticallynperfect binoculars,,trying to find a solution that wouldnmaintain his true robot materials,but solve this reflection problem. 
 So we started with the lenses.,Here's the flat-front lens,,we have a concave lens,and a convex lens.,And here you see all three together,,showing us all these reflections.,We tried turning them down,,we tried blocking them,,nothing was working.,You can see here,,sometimes we needed something specificnreflected in his eyes --,usually Eve.,So we couldn't just use some fakednabstract image on the lenses.,So here we have Eve on the first lens,,we put Eve on the second lens,,it's not working.,We turn it down,,it's still not working. 
 And then we have our eureka moment.,We add a light to WALL-Enthat accidentally leaks into his eyes.,You can see it light upnthese gray aperture blades.,Suddenly, those aperture bladesnare poking through that reflection,the way nothing else has.,Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.,As humans we have the white of our eye,,the colored iris,and the black pupil.,Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,,the gray aperture blades,and the black pupil.,Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,,like there's a characternwith emotion inside.,Later in the movie towards the end,,WALL-E loses his personality,,essentially going dead.,This is the perfect time to bring backnthat glassy-eyed look.,In the next scene,nWALL-E comes back to life.,We bring that light back to bringnthe aperture blades back,,and he returns to that sweet,nsoulful robot we've come to love. 
 (Video) WALL-E: Eva? 
 Danielle Feinberg: There's a beautynin these unexpected moments --,when you find the keynto unlocking a robot's soul,,the moment when you discovernwhat you want to do with your life.,The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo"nwas one of those moments for me. 
 There are scenes in every movienthat struggle to come together.,This was one of those scenes.,The director had a vision for this scene,based on some wonderful footagenof jellyfish in the South Pacific.,As we went along,,we were floundering.,The reviews with the director,turned from the normalnlook-and-feel conversation,into more and more questionsnabout numbers and percentages.,Maybe because unlike normal,,we were basing it onnsomething in real life,,or maybe just because we had lost our way.,But it had become about usingnour brain without our eyes,,the science without the art.,That scientific tethernwas strangling the scene. 
 But even through all the frustrations,,I still believed it could be beautiful.,So when it came in to lighting,,I dug in.,As I worked to balancenthe blues and the pinks,,the caustics dancingnon the jellyfish bells,,the undulating fog beams,,something promising began to appear.,I came in one morning and checkednthe previous night's work.,And I got excited.,And then I showed itnto the lighting director,and she got excited.,Soon, I was showing to the directornin a dark room full of 50 people. 
 In director review,,you hope you might get some nice words,,then you get some notesnand fixes, generally.,And then, hopefully, you get a final,,signaling to move on to the next stage.,I gave my intro, and I playednthe jellyfish scene.,And the director was silentnfor an uncomfortably long amount of time.,Just long enough for me to think,,"Oh no, this is doomed.",And then he started clapping.,And then the productionndesigner started clapping.,And then the whole room was clapping.,This is the momentnthat I live for in lighting.,The moment where it all comes together,and we get a world that we can believe in. 
 We use math, science and codento create these amazing worlds.,We use storytelling and artnto bring them to life.,It's this interweaving of art and science,that elevates the worldnto a place of wonder,,a place with soul,,a place we can believe in,,a place where the thingsnyou imagine can become real --,and a world where a girl suddenly realizes,not only is she a scientist,,but also an artist. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Tonight, I'm going to share with younmy passion for science.,I'm not talking about sciencenthat takes baby steps.,I'm talking about sciencenthat takes enormous leaps.,I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,,I'm talking revolutionary sciencenthat turns the world on its head.,In a moment, I'm going to talknabout two ideas that might do this.,I say "might",because, with revolutionary ideas,nmost are flat wrong,,and even those that are rightnseldom have the impact,that we want them to have. 
 To explain why I pickedntwo ideas in particular,,I'm going to start with a mystery.,1847, Vienna, Austria.,Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber,ncompulsively thorough doctor,who ran two maternity clinics.,They were identical except for one thing.,Women were dying of high feversnsoon after giving birth,three times more oftennat one of the clinics than at the other.,Trying to figure outnwhat the difference was that caused this,,Semmelweis looked at everything he could.,Sanitation? No.,Medical procedures? No.,Air flow? No. 
 The puzzle went unsolvednuntil he happened to autopsy a doctor,who died of an infected scalpel cut.,The doctor's symptoms were identicalnto those of the mothers who were dying.,How was that possible?,How could a male doctornget the same thing as new mothers?,Semmelweis reconstructedneverything the doctor had done,right before he got sick,,and he discoverednthat he'd been autopsying a corpse.,Had something gottennin his wound that killed him?,With growing excitement,,Semmelweis lookednfor any connection he could,between dead bodies in the morguenand dead mothers in his delivery room,,and he found it.,It turned out that at the hospitalnwith the high death rate,,but not the others,,doctors delivered babies immediatelynafter autopsying corpses in the morgue.,Aha! Corpses were contaminatingnthe doctors' hands,and killing his mothers.,So he ordered the doctorsnto sterilize their hands,,and the deaths stopped.,Dr. Ignaz Semmelweisnhad discovered infectious disease. 
 But the doctors of the daynthought he was crazy,,because they knew,nand had for hundreds of years,,that odorous vaporsncalled miasmas caused disease,,not these hypothetical particlesnthat you couldn't see.,It took 20 yearsnfor Frenchman Louis Pasteur,to prove that Semmelweis was right.,Pasteur was an agricultural chemist,who tried to figure outnwhy milk and beer spoiled so often.,He found that bacteria were the culprits.,He also found that bacteriancould kill people in exactly the same way,that Semmelweis's patients were dying. 
 We now look at what I wantnto talk about tonight, in two ideas.,We saw it with Semmelweis,nthat he was a revolutionary.,He did it for two reasons.,One, he opened our eyesnto a completely new world.,We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.,We just didn't knownthat bacteria killed people.,And he also demolished fond ideasnthat people kept close to their heart.,Miasmas didn't kill people.nBacteria killed people. 
 So this brings me to the two ideasnI want to talk about tonight.,One has opened our eyesnto a completely new universe,,and the other attacks long-held beliefs. 
 Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.,He's a physicist who has opened our eyesnto an entirely new world,by violating the laws of physics.,Betzig is a true rebel.,He quit a job at prestigiousnBell Laboratory,inventing new microscopes for biology,because he thought scientistsnwere taking his brilliant inventions,and doing lousy work with them.,So he became a househusband,,but he never lost his passionnfor figuring out,how to get microscopesnto see finer and finer details,than had ever been seen beforenor ever could be seen.,This is crucial if we're everngoing to understand how cells work,,and how cancer works,,and how somethingn150th the size of a head of a pin,can do all these amazing things,,like make proteins,and move charges around,and all of those things. 
 There's just one problem.,There's this thingncalled the law of physics,,and part of the law of physicsnis the thing called the diffraction limit.,The diffraction limit is kind of likenwhen you go to a doctor's office,,you can only see so far down,nno matter how good glasses you have. 
 This was a so-called impossible problem.,But one of Betzig's friendsnfigured out how to take a tiny molecule,that was smaller thannthe best microscope could see,and get it to light up and fluoresce.,"Aha!" Betzig said.,"I think maybe the laws of physicsnare not so unbreakable after all." 
 So he lashed together a microscopenin his friend's living room.,He had no laboratory.,This revolutionary instrumentngot different protein molecules,to light up in different colors,,and with a computer, he was ablento turn very, very fuzzy blurs,into very sharp dots and produce imagesnof unprecedented and startling clarity. 
 For this work, last year,,Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.,Why?,Because now we can seenwith unprecedented detail,things that we never had seen before,,and now doctors can getna better handle on things like cancer. 
 But do you thinknBetzig was satisfied there?,No.,He wanted movies.,The problem was,that even the genius microscopesnthat he invented were just too slow.,So what did he do?,He came up with a 200-year-old idea,called moiré patterns.,So the way that works isnif you take two very, very fine patterns,and you move them across each other,,you will see a gross pattern,that a microscope can see,that otherwise you would notnbe able to see.,So he applied this techniquento taking a really blurry image of a cell,and moving lots of structurednlight patterns across it,until this cell became crystal clear.,And here is the result:,a mysterious new world,,full of strange things zipping around,doing things thatnwe don't know what they're doing.,But when we figure it out,nwe'll have a better handle on life itself. 
 For example, thosengreen globs that you see?,Those things are called clathrins.,They're moleculesnthat protect other molecules,as they move through a cell.,Unfortunately, viruses sometimesnhijack those to infect cells.,Also, you see those little squigglynwormlike things moving around?,Those are actin molecules.,Unfortunately, virusesnalso climb down those things,to get into the cell nucleus,to replicate themselves and make you sick. 
 Now that we can look at movies,of what's actually going onndeep inside a cell,,we have a much better chancenof curing viral diseases like AIDS. 
 So when you look at a movie like this,,it's very clear that Betzig has openednour eyes to a completely new world.,But he hasn't shatterednany cherished beliefs. 
 That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey,at Cambridge.,De Grey definitely has scientistsnsquirming with an interesting idea:,we can be immortal.,We can beat aging.,Now, most scientistsnthink he's a crackpot.,Any Biology 101 student knows,that aging is an inevitablenconsequence of living.,For example, when we eat,,we take in food and we metabolize it,,and that throws offnwhat we call free radicals.,You might have heard of those.,Also known as oxygen ions,,those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,,and cause us to get old and lose our hair. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's just like, no, it's exactly like,oxygen binding to iron and making it rust.,So you age because you rust out. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, and scientists also knownthere is something called immortality:,in cancer cells.,So if you stop aging,,all of you are going to turnninto giant walking malignant tumors. 
 These are cherished beliefs,nbut could de Grey be on to something?,I think he deserves a closer look.,First of all, I have a really hard timenseeing him as a crackpot.,Yeah, he started off lifenas a computer scientist,,not a biologist,,but he earned a PhDnin biology from Cambridge,,and he has publishednsome very significant work,on mitochondrial DNAnand a bunch of other stuff.,Secondly, he startednan antiaging foundation,that has identifiednseven different causes of aging,,to me, that seem very plausible,,and he is hot in pursuitnof fixes for every single one of them.,For example, one of the reasons we agenis that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,,and we get kind of oldnand our cells lose energy.,He believes, and he's madena convincing case,,that using viruses we can do gene therapy,,fix that DNA,and rejuvenate our cells. 
 One more thing.,We have an existent proof,that extreme longevity is possible.,Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,,and some lobsters don't age at all. 
 Now, this doesn't mean that de Greynis going to revolutionize our lifespans.,I mean, after all, we're not trees,nand most of us are not lobsters. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I've got to believe that there arenDarwins and Einsteins out there,,and I'll tell you why.,Consider this:,there are seven times more peoplenalive today than during Darwin's time.,There are four times as many peoplenalive today as Einstein.,When you consider,that the proportion of scientistsnin the population has skyrocketed,,there are now seven million scientists.,I've got to believe, and I do believe,nthat there's one of them out there,who is working right now in obscurity,to rock our lives,nand I don't know about you,,but I can't wait to be rocked. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, this is a story,about how we know what we know. 
 It's a story about this woman,,Natalia Rybczynski.,She's a paleobiologist,,which means she specializesnin digging up really old dead stuff. 
 (Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,nI had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things." 
 Latif Nasser: And I thinknshe's particularly interesting,because of where she digs that stuff up,,way above the Arctic Circlenin the remote Canadian tundra. 
 Now, one summer day in 2006,,she was at a dig site callednthe Fyles Leaf Bed,,which is less than 10 degrees latitudenaway from the magnetic north pole. 
 (Audio) NR: Really, it's notngoing to sound very exciting,,because it was a day of walkingnwith your backpack and your GPS,and notebook and just picking upnanything that might be a fossil. 
 LN: And at some point,nshe noticed something. 
 (Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,,about the size of the palm of my hand.,It was just lying on the surface. 
 LN: And at first she thoughtnit was just a splinter of wood,,because that's the sort of thingnpeople had found,at the Fyles Leaf Bed before --nprehistoric plant parts.,But that night, back at camp ... 
 (Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,,I'm looking a little bitnmore closely and realizing,it doesn't quite looknlike this has tree rings.,Maybe it's a preservation thing,,but it looks really like ...,bone. 
 LN: Huh. So over the next four years,,she went to that spot over and over,,and eventually collected 30 fragmentsnof that exact same bone,,most of them really tiny. 
 (Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.nIt fits in a small Ziploc bag. 
 LN: And she tried to piece themntogether like a jigsaw puzzle.,But it was challenging. 
 (Audio) NR: It's broken upninto so many little tiny pieces,,I'm trying to use sand and putty,nand it's not looking good.,So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner. 
 LN: Ooh!nNR: Yeah, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 LN: It turns out it was way easiernto do it virtually. 
 (Audio) NR: It's kind of magicalnwhen it all fits together. 
 LN: How certain were younthat you had it right,,that you had put it togethernin the right way?,Was there a potential that you'dnput it together a different way,and have, like, a parakeet or something? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.nNo, we got this. 
 LN: What she had, she discovered,nwas a tibia, a leg bone,,and specifically, one that belongednto a cloven-hoofed mammal,,so something like a cow or a sheep.,But it couldn't have been either of those.,It was just too big. 
 (Audio) NR: The size of this thing,nit was huge. It's a really big animal. 
 LN: So what animal could it be?,Having hit a wall, she showednone of the fragments,to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,,and they had an idea. 
 (Audio) NR: We took a saw,nand we nicked just the edge of it,,and there was this really interestingnsmell that comes from it. 
 LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.,It was a smell that Natalia recognized,from cutting up skullsnin her gross anatomy lab:,collagen.,Collagen is what givesnstructure to our bones.,And usually, after so many years,,it breaks down.,But in this case, the Arctic had actednlike a natural freezer and preserved it. 
 Then a year or two later,nNatalia was at a conference in Bristol,,and she saw that a colleaguenof hers named Mike Buckley,was demoing this new processnthat he called "collagen fingerprinting.",It turns out that different speciesnhave slightly different structures,of collagen,,so if you get a collagen profilenof an unknown bone,,you can compare itnto those of known species,,and, who knows, maybe you get a match. 
 So she shipped him one of the fragments,,FedEx. 
 (Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.nIt's kind of important. 
 (Laughter) 
 LN: And he processed it,,and compared it to 37 knownnand modern-day mammal species.,And he found a match.,It turns out thatnthe 3.5 million-year-old bone,that Natalia had dugnout of the High Arctic,belonged to ...,a camel. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?nThat's amazing -- if it's true. 
 LN: So they testedna bunch of the fragments,,and they got the same result for each one.,However, based on the sizenof the bone that they found,,it meant that this camel was 30 percentnlarger than modern-day camels.,So this camel would have beennabout nine feet tall,,weighed around a ton. 
 (Audience reacts) 
 Yeah.,Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, when you hear the word "camel,",what may come to mind is one of these,,the Bactrian camelnof East and Central Asia.,But chances are the postcard imagenyou have in your brain,is one of these, the dromedary,,quintessential desert creature --,hangs out in sandy, hot placesnlike the Middle East and the Sahara,,has a big old hump on its back,for storing waternfor those long desert treks,,has big, broad feet to help itntromp over sand dunes.,So how on earth would one of these guysnend up in the High Arctic? 
 Well, scientists have knownnfor a long time, turns out,,even before Natalia's discovery,,that camels are actuallynoriginally American. 
 (Music: The Star-Spangled Banner) 
 (Laughter) 
 They started here.,For nearly 40 of the 45 million yearsnthat camels have been around,,you could only find them in North America,,around 20 different species, maybe more. 
 (Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,nwould they look different? 
 NR: Yeah, you're going to havendifferent body sizes.,You'll have some with really long necks,,so they're actuallynfunctionally like giraffes. 
 LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles. 
 (Audio) NR: The really primitive,nearly ones would have been really small,,almost like rabbits. 
 LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels? 
 (Audio) NR: The earliest ones.,So those ones you probablynwould not recognize. 
 LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel. 
 (Audio) NR: I know,nwouldn't that be great? 
 (Laughter) 
 LN: And then about threento seven million years ago,,one branch of camelsnwent down to South America,,where they became llamas and alpacas,,and another branch crossed overnthe Bering Land Bridge,into Asia and Africa.,And then around the endnof the last ice age,,North American camels went extinct. 
 So, scientists knew all of that already,,but it still doesn't fully explainnhow Natalia found one so far north.,Like, this is, temperature-wise,nthe polar opposite of the Sahara.,Now to be fair,,three and a half million years ago,,it was on average 22 degrees Celsiusnwarmer than it is now.,So it would have been boreal forest,,so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.,But still, like, they would havensix-month-long winters,where the ponds would freeze over.,You'd have blizzards.,You'd have 24 hours a daynof straight darkness.,Like, how ... How?,How is it that one of thesenSaharan superstars,could ever have survivednthose arctic conditions? 
 (Laughter) 
 Natalia and her colleaguesnthink they have an answer.,And it's kind of brilliant.,What if the very features that we imaginenmake the camel so well-suited,to places like the Sahara,,actually evolved to help itnget through the winter?,What if those broad feet were meantnto tromp not over sand,,but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?,What if that hump --nwhich, huge news to me,,does not contain water, it contains fat -- 
 (Laughter) 
 was there to help the camelnget through that six-month-long winter,,when food was scarce?,And then, only later, long afternit crossed over the land bridge,did it retrofit those winter featuresnfor a hot desert environment?,Like, for instance, the humpnmay be helpful to camels in hotter climes,because having all your fat in one place,,like a, you know, fat backpack,,means that you don't havento have that insulation,all over the rest of your body.,So it helps heat dissipate easier.,It's this crazy idea,,that what seems like proof of the camel'snquintessential desert nature,could actually be proofnof its High Arctic past. 
 Now, I'm not the first personnto tell this story.,Others have told it as a waynto marvel at evolutionary biology,or as a keyhole into the futurenof climate change.,But I love it for a totallyndifferent reason.,For me, it's a story about us,,about how we see the world,and about how that changes. 
 So I was trained as a historian.,And I've learned that, actually,na lot of scientists are historians, too.,They make sense of the past.,They tell the history of our universe,nof our planet, of life on this planet.,And as a historian,,you start with an idea in your mindnof how the story goes. 
 (Audio) NR: We make up storiesnand we stick with it,,like the camel in the desert, right?,That's a great story!nIt's totally adapted for that.,Clearly, it always lived there. 
 LN: But at any moment, you couldnuncover some tiny bit of evidence.,You could learn some tiny thing,that forces you to reframeneverything you thought you knew.,Like, in this case, this one scientistnfinds this one shard,of what she thought was wood,,and because of that, science has a totallynnew and totally counterintuitive theory,about why this absurdnDr. Seuss-looking creature,looks the way it does.,And for me, it completely upendednthe way I think of the camel.,It went from beingnthis ridiculously niche creature,suited only to thisnone specific environment,,to being this world travelernthat just happens to be in the Sahara,,and could end up virtually anywhere. 
 (Applause) 
 This is Azuri.,Azuri, hi, how are you doing?,OK, here, I've gotnone of these for you here. 
 (Laughter) 
 So Azuri is on a breaknfrom her regular gig,at the Radio City Music Hall. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not even a joke.,Anyway -- 
 But really, Azuri is herenas a living reminder,that the story of our worldnis a dynamic one.,It requires our willingnessnto readjust, to reimagine. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right, Azuri? 
 And, really, that we're allnjust one shard of bone away,from seeing the world anew. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Cancer affects all of us --,especially the ones that comenback over and over again,,the highly invasivenand drug-resistant ones,,the ones that defy medical treatment,,even when we throw our best drugs at them.,Engineering at the molecular level,,working at the smallest of scales,,can provide exciting new ways,to fight the most aggressivenforms of cancer. 
 Cancer is a very clever disease.,There are some forms of cancer,,which, fortunately, we've learnednhow to address relatively well,with known and establishedndrugs and surgery.,But there are some forms of cancer,that don't respond to these approaches,,and the tumor survives or comes back,,even after an onslaught of drugs. 
 We can think of thesenvery aggressive forms of cancer,as kind of supervillains in a comic book.,They're clever, they're adaptable,,and they're very good at staying alive.,And, like most supervillains these days,,their superpowers comenfrom a genetic mutation.,The genes that are modifiedninside these tumor cells,can enable and encode for newnand unimagined modes of survival,,allowing the cancer cell to live through,even our best chemotherapy treatments. 
 One example is a tricknin which a gene allows a cell,,even as the drug approaches the cell,,to push the drug out,,before the drug can have any effect.,Imagine -- the cell effectivelynspits out the drug.,This is just one examplenof the many genetic tricks,in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.,All due to mutant genes. 
 So, we have a supervillainnwith incredible superpowers.,And we need a new and powerfulnmode of attack.,Actually, we can turn off a gene.,The key is a set of moleculesnknown as siRNA.,siRNA are short sequences of genetic code,that guide a cell to block a certain gene.,Each siRNA moleculencan turn off a specific gene,inside the cell.,For many years since its discovery,,scientists have been very excited,about how we can applynthese gene blockers in medicine. 
 But, there is a problem.,siRNA works well inside the cell.,But if it gets exposed to the enzymes,that reside in our bloodstreamnor our tissues,,it degrades within seconds.,It has to be packaged, protectednthrough its journey through the body,on its way to the final targetninside the cancer cell. 
 So, here's our strategy.,First, we'll dose the cancer cellnwith siRNA, the gene blocker,,and silence those survival genes,,and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.,But how do we carry that out?,Using molecular engineering,,we can actually design a superweapon,that can travel through the bloodstream.,It has to be tiny enoughnto get through the bloodstream,,it's got to be small enoughnto penetrate the tumor tissue,,and it's got to be tiny enoughnto be taken up inside the cancer cell.,To do this job well,,it has to be about one one-hundredthnthe size of a human hair. 
 Let's take a closer looknat how we can build this nanoparticle.,First, let's startnwith the nanoparticle core.,It's a tiny capsule that containsnthe chemotherapy drug.,This is the poison that willnactually end the tumor cell's life.,Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,,nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.,This is our gene blocker.,Because siRNA is stronglynnegatively charged,,we can protect it,with a nice, protective layernof positively charged polymer.,The two oppositely chargednmolecules stick together,through charge attraction,,and that provides usnwith a protective layer,that prevents the siRNAnfrom degrading in the bloodstream.,We're almost done. 
 (Laughter) 
 But there is one more big obstaclenwe have to think about.,In fact, it may be the biggestnobstacle of all.,How do we deploy this superweapon?,I mean, every good weaponnneeds to be targeted,,we have to target this superweaponnto the supervillain cells,that reside in the tumor. 
 But our bodies have a naturalnimmune-defense system:,cells that reside in the bloodstream,and pick out things that don't belong,,so that it can destroy or eliminate them.,And guess what? Our nanoparticlenis considered a foreign object.,We have to sneak our nanoparticlenpast the tumor defense system.,We have to get it past this mechanismnof getting rid of the foreign object,by disguising it. 
 So we add one morennegatively charged layer,around this nanoparticle,,which serves two purposes.,First, this outer layer is onenof the naturally charged,,highly hydrated polysaccharidesnthat resides in our body.,It creates a cloud of water moleculesnaround the nanoparticle,that gives us an invisibilityncloaking effect.,This invisibility cloak allowsnthe nanoparticle,to travel through the bloodstream,long and far enough to reach the tumor,,without getting eliminated by the body. 
 Second, this layer contains molecules,which bind specifically to our tumor cell.,Once bound, the cancer cellntakes up the nanoparticle,,and now we have our nanoparticleninside the cancer cell,and ready to deploy. 
 Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go! 
 (Applause) 
 The siRNA is deployed first.,It acts for hours,,giving enough time to silencenand block those survival genes.,We have now disablednthose genetic superpowers.,What remains is a cancer cellnwith no special defenses.,Then, the chemotherapy drugncomes out of the core,and destroys the tumor cellncleanly and efficiently.,With sufficient gene blockers,,we can address manyndifferent kinds of mutations,,allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,,without leaving behind any bad guys. 
 So, how does our strategy work?,We've tested these nanostructurenparticles in animals,using a highly aggressive formnof triple-negative breast cancer.,This triple-negative breast cancernexhibits the gene,that spits out cancer drugnas soon as it is delivered. 
 Usually, doxorubicin -- let's callnit "dox" -- is the cancer drug,that is the first line of treatmentnfor breast cancer.,So, we first treated our animalsnwith a dox core, dox only.,The tumor slowed their rate of growth,,but they still grew rapidly,,doubling in sizenover a period of two weeks. 
 Then, we triednour combination superweapon.,A nanolayer particle with siRNAnagainst the chemo pump,,plus, we have the dox in the core.,And look -- we found that not onlyndid the tumors stop growing,,they actually decreased in size,and were eliminated in some cases.,The tumors were actually regressing. 
 (Applause) 
 What's great about this approachnis that it can be personalized.,We can add many different layers of siRNA,to address different mutationsnand tumor defense mechanisms.,And we can put different drugsninto the nanoparticle core.,As doctors learn how to test patients,and understand certainntumor genetic types,,they can help us determine which patientsncan benefit from this strategy,and which gene blockers we can use. 
 Ovarian cancer strikesna special chord with me.,It is a very aggressive cancer,,in part because it's discoverednat very late stages,,when it's highly advanced,and there are a numbernof genetic mutations.,After the first round of chemotherapy,,this cancer comes backnfor 75 percent of patients.,And it usually comes backnin a drug-resistant form.,High-grade ovarian cancer,is one of the biggestnsupervillains out there.,And we're now directing our superweapon,toward its defeat. 
 As a researcher,,I usually don't get to work with patients.,But I recently met a mother,who is an ovarian cancer survivor,nMimi, and her daughter, Paige.,I was deeply inspirednby the optimism and strength,that both mother and daughter displayed,and by their story of courage and support.,At this event, we spokenabout the different technologies,directed at cancer.,And Mimi was in tears,as she explained how learningnabout these efforts,gives her hope for future generations,,including her own daughter.,This really touched me.,It's not just about buildingnreally elegant science.,It's about changing people's lives.,It's about understandingnthe power of engineering,on the scale of molecules. 
 I know that as students like Paigenmove forward in their careers,,they'll open new possibilities,in addressing some of the bignhealth problems in the world --,including ovarian cancer, neurologicalndisorders, infectious disease --,just as chemical engineering hasnfound a way to open doors for me,,and has provided a way of engineering,on the tiniest scale,nthat of molecules,,to heal on the human scale. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Is there life beyond Earthnin our solar system? 
 Wow, what a powerful question.,You know, as a scientist --,planetary scientist --,we really didn't take thatnvery seriously until recently. 
 Carl Sagan always said,,"It takes extraordinary evidencenfor extraordinary claims.",And the claims of having life beyond Earth,need to be definitive,,they need to be loud,and they need to be everywherenfor us to be able to believe it. 
 So how do we make this journey?,What we decided to do,is first look fornthose ingredients for life.,The ingredients of life are:,liquid water --,we have to have a solvent,,can't be ice, has to be liquid.,We also have to have energy.,We also have to have organic material --,things that make us up,,but also things that we need to consume. 
 So we have to have these elements,in environments for long periods of time,for us to be ablento be confident that life,,in that moment when it starts,,can spark and then grow and evolve. 
 Well, I have to tell younthat early in my career,,when we looked at those three elements,,I didn't believenthat they were beyond Earth,in any length of timenand for any real quantity. 
 Why? We look at the inner planets.,Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.,Mars -- dry and arid.,It's got no water.,And beyond Mars,,the water in the solar systemnis all frozen. 
 But recent observationsnhave changed all that.,It's now turning our attentionnto the right places,for us to take a deeper look,and really start to answernour life question. 
 So when we look out into the solar system,,where are the possibilities?,We're concentrating our attentionnon four locations.,The planet Mars,and then three moons of the outer planets:,Titan, Europa and small Enceladus. 
 So what about Mars?,Let's go through the evidence.,Well, Mars we thoughtnwas initially moon-like:,full of craters, arid and a dead world. 
 And so about 15 years ago,,we started a seriesnof missions to go to Mars,and see if water existednon Mars in its past,that changed its geology.,We ought to be able to notice that.,And indeed we startednto be surprised right away.,Our higher resolution imagesnshow deltas and river valleys and gulleys,that were there in the past.,And in fact,,Curiosity --,which has been roving on the surfacennow for about three years --,has really shown us that it's sittingnin an ancient river bed,,where water flowed rapidly.,And not for a little while,,perhaps hundreds of millions of years.,And if everything was there,,including organics,,perhaps life had started. 
 Curiosity has alsondrilled in that red soil,and brought up other material.,And we were really excitednwhen we saw that.,Because it wasn't red Mars,,it was gray material,,it's gray Mars.,We brought it into the rover,,we tasted it,,and guess what?,We tasted organics --,carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,,nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur --,they were all there. 
 So Mars in its past,,with a lot of water,,perhaps plenty of time,,could have had life,,could have had that spark,,could have grown.,And is that life still there?,We don't know that. 
 But a few years ago,we started to look at a number of craters.,During the summer,,dark lines would appearndown the sides of these craters.,The more we looked,,the more craters we saw,,the more of these features.,We now know more than a dozen of them. 
 A few months ago the fairy tale came true.,We announced to the worldnthat we know what these streaks are.,It's liquid water.,These craters are weepingnduring the summer.,Liquid water is flowingndown these craters.,So what are we going to do now --,now that we see the water?,Well, it tells us that Mars hasnall the ingredients necessary for life.,In its past it had perhapsntwo-thirds of its northern hemisphere --,there was an ocean.,It has weeping water right now.,Liquid water on its surface.,It has organics.,It has all the right conditions. 
 So what are we going to do next?,We're going to launch a series of missions,to begin that search for life on Mars.,And now it's more appealingnthan ever before. 
 As we move out into the solar system,,here's the tiny moon Enceladus.,This is not in what we callnthe traditional habitable zone,,this area around the sun.,This is much further out.,This object should benice over a silicate core. 
 But what did we find?,Cassini was there since 2006,,and after a couple yearsnlooked back after it flew by Enceladus,and surprised us all.,Enceladus is blasting sheets of waternout into the solar system,and sloshing back down onto the moon.,What a fabulous environment.,Cassini just a few months agonalso flew through the plume,,and it measured silicate particles.,Where does the silica come from?,It must come from the ocean floor.,The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,,pulling and squeezing this moon --,is melting that ice,,creating an ocean.,But it's also doing that to the core. 
 Now, the only thing that we can think of,that does that here on Earthnas an analogy ...,are hydrothermal vents.,Hydrothermal vents deep in our oceannwere discovered in 1977.,Oceanographers were completely surprised.,And now there are thousandsnof these below the ocean. 
 What do we find?,The oceanographers, when they gonand look at these hydrothermal vents,,they're teeming with life,,regardless of whether the waternis acidic or alkaline --,doesn't matter.,So hydrothermal vents arena fabulous abode for life here on Earth. 
 So what about Enceladus?,Well, we believe because it has water,and has had it forna significant period of time,,and we believe it has hydrothermal vents,with perhaps the right organic material,,it is a place where life could exist.,And not just microbial --,maybe more complexnbecause it's had time to evolve. 
 Another moon, very similar,,is Europa.,Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996,and made fabulous observations of Europa.,Europa, we also know,nhas an under-the-ice crust ocean.,Galileo mission told us that,nbut we never saw any plumes.,But we didn't look for them. 
 Hubble,,just a couple years ago,,observing Europa,,saw plumes of water,spraying from the cracksnin the southern hemisphere,,just exactly like Enceladus. 
 These moons,,which are not in what we callna traditional habitable zone,,that are out in the solar system,,have liquid water.,And if there are organics there,,there may be life. 
 This is a fabulous set of discoveries,because these moonsnhave been in this environment like that,for billions of years.,Life started here on Earth, we believe,nafter about the first 500 million,,and look where we are.,These moons are fabulous moons. 
 Another moon that we'renlooking at is Titan.,Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.,It perhaps is much largernthan the planet Mercury.,It has an extensive atmosphere.,It's so extensive --,and it's mostly nitrogennwith a little methane and ethane --,that you have to peernthrough it with radar. 
 And on the surface,nCassini has found liquid.,We see lakes ...,actually almost the sizenof our Black Sea in some places.,And this area is not liquid water;,it's methane.,If there's any place in the solar systemnwhere life is not like us,,where the substitute of waternis another solvent --,and it could be methane --,it could be Titan. 
 Well, is there life beyond Earthnin the solar system?,We don't know yet,,but we're hot on the pursuit.,The data that we're receivingnis really exciting,and telling us --,forcing us to think about thisnin new and exciting ways.,I believe we're on the right track.,That in the next 10 years,nwe will answer that question.,And if we answer it,,and it's positive,,then life is everywherenin the solar system.,Just think about that.,We may not be alone. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, there's an actorncalled Dustin Hoffman.,And years ago, he made this movienwhich some of you may have heard of,,called "The Graduate.",And there's two key scenes in that movie.,The first one is the seduction scene.,I'm not going to talk about that tonight. 
 (Laughter) 
 The second scene is where he's taken outnby the old guy to the pool,,and as a young college graduate,nthe old guy basically says one word,,just one word.,And of course, all of you knownwhat that word is.,It's "plastics." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the only problem with that is,nit was completely the wrong advice. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me tell you why it was so wrong.,The word should have been "silicon.",And the reason it should have been silicon,is because the basic patentsnfor semiconductors had already been made,,had already been filed,,and they were already building them.,So Silicon Valley was justnbeing built in 1967,,when this movie was released.,And the year after the movie was released,,Intel was founded.,So had the graduate heardnthe right one word,,maybe he would have ended upnonstage -- oh, I don't know --,maybe with these two. 
 (Laughter) 
 So as you're thinking of that,,let's see what bit of advicenwe might want to give,so that your next graduate doesn't becomena Tupperware salesman. 
 (Laughter) 
 So in 2015, what word of advicenwould you give people,,when you took a collegengraduate out by the pool,and you said one word, just one word?,I think the answer would be "lifecode.",So what is "lifecode?",Lifecode is the various waysnwe have of programming life.,So instead of programming computers,,we're using things to program viruses,or retroviruses or proteins,or DNA or RNA,or plants or animals,nor a whole series of creatures.,And as you're thinkingnabout this incredible ability,to make life do what you want it to do,,what it's programmed to do,,what you end up doing,is taking what we've been doingnfor thousands of years,,which is breeding, changing,,mixing, matching,all kinds of life-forms,,and we accelerate it. 
 And this is not something new.,This humble mustard weed has been modified,so that if you change it in one way,nyou get broccoli.,And if you change itnin a second way, you get kale.,And if you change it in a third way,,you get cauliflower.,So when you go to thesenall-natural, organic markets,,you're really going to a place,where people have been changingnthe lifecode of plants for a long time.,The difference today,,to pick a completelynpolitically neutral term -- 
 [Intelligent design] 
 (Laughter) 
 We're beginning to practicenintelligent design.,That means that insteadnof doing this at random,and seeing what happens over generations,,we're inserting specific genes,nwe're inserting specific proteins,,and we're changing lifecodenfor very deliberate purposes.,And that allows us to acceleratenhow this stuff happens. 
 Let me just give you one example.,Some of you occasionallynmight think about sex.,And we kind of take it for grantednhow we've changed sex.,So we think it's perfectly normalnand natural to change it.,What's happened with sex over time is --,normally, sex equals baby, eventually.,But in today's world,,sex plus pill equals no baby. 
 (Laughter) 
 And again, we thinknthat's perfectly normal and natural,,but that has not been the casenfor most of human history.,And it's not the case for animals.,What it is does is it gives us control,,so sex becomes separate from conception.,And as you're thinkingnof the consequences of that,,then we've been playing with stuff,that's a little bit morenadvanced, like art.,Not in the sensenof painting and sculpture,,but in the sense of assistednreproductive technologies.,So what are assistednreproductive technologies?,Assisted reproductive technologiesnare things like in vitro fertilization.,And when you do in vitro fertilization,nthere's very good reasons to do it.,Sometimes you justncan't conceive otherwise.,But when you do that,,what you’re doing is separatingnsex, conception, baby.,So you haven't just taken controlnof when you have a baby,,you've separated when the babynand where the baby is fertilized.,So you've separated the baby,from the body from the act.,And as you're thinkingnof other things we've been doing,,think about twins.,So you can freeze sperm,nyou can freeze eggs,,you can freeze fertilized eggs.,And what does that mean?,Well, that's a good thingnif you're a cancer patient.,You're about to go under chemotherapynor under radiation,,so you save these things.,You don't irradiate them.,But if you can save themnand you can freeze them,,and you can have a surrogate mother,,it means that you'vendecoupled sex from time.,It means you can have twinsnborn -- oh, in 50 years? 
 (Laughter) 
 In a hundred years?,Two hundred years?,And these are threenreally profound changes,that are not, like, future stuff.,This is stuff we take for granted today. 
 So this lifecode stuffnturns out to be a superpower.,It turns out to be this incrediblynpowerful way of changing viruses,,of changing plants, of changing animals,,perhaps even of evolving ourselves.,It's something that Steve Gullans and Inhave been thinking about for a while. 
 Let's have some risks.,Like every powerful technology,nlike electricity, like an automobile,,like computers, this stuffnpotentially can be misused.,And that scares a lot of people.,And as you apply these technologies,,you can even turn humannbeings into chimeras.,Remember the Greek mythnwhere you mix animals?,Well, some of these treatments,actually end up changing your blood type.,Or they'll put male cellsnin a female body or vice versa,,which sounds absolutely horrible,until you realize, the reasonnyou're doing that,is you're substituting bone marrownduring cancer treatments.,So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,,you may be changingnsome fundamental aspects of yourself,,but you're also saving your life.,And as you're thinking about this stuff,,here's somethingnthat happened 20 years ago. 
 This is Emma Ott.,She's a recent college admittee.,She's studying accounting.,She played two varsity sports.nShe graduated as a valedictorian.,And that's not particularly extraordinary,,except that she's the first human beingnborn to three parents.,Why?,Because she had a deadlynmitochondrial disease,that she might have inherited.,So when you swap out a third person's DNA,and you put it in there,,you save the lives of people.,But you also are doingngermline engineering,,which means her kids,nif she has kids, will be saved,and won't go through this.,And [their] kids will be saved,,and their grandchildren will be saved,,and this passes on. 
 That makes people nervous.,So 20 years ago,nthe various authorities said,,why don't we study this for a while?,There are risks to doing stuff,nand there are risks to not doing stuff,,because there were a couple dozen peoplensaved by this technology,,and then we've been thinking about itnfor the next 20 years.,So as we think about it,,as we take the time to say, "Hey,nmaybe we should have longer studies,,maybe we should do this,nmaybe we should do that,",there are consequences to acting,nand there are consequences to not acting.,Like curing deadly diseases --,which, by the way,nis completely unnatural.,It is normal and naturalnfor humans to be felled,by massive epidemics of polio,nof smallpox, of tuberculosis.,When we put vaccines into people,nwe are putting unnatural things,into their body,because we think the benefitnoutweighs the risk.,Because we've built unnatural plants,nunnatural animals,,we can feed about seven billion people.,We can do thingsnlike create new life-forms.,And as you create new life-forms,nagain, that sounds terribly scary,and terribly bothersome,,until you realize that those life-formsnlive on your dining room table.,Those flowers you've gotnon your dining room table --,there's not a lotnthat's natural about them,,because people have been breedingnthe flowers to make this color,,to be this size, to last for a week.,You don't usually givenyour loved one wildflowers,because they don't lastna whole lot of time. 
 What all this does,is it flips Darwin completely on his head.,See, for four billion years,,what lived and died on this planetndepended on two principles:,on natural selection and random mutation.,And so what lived and died,nwhat was structured,,has now been flipped on its head.,And what we've done,is created this completelynparallel evolutionary system,where we are practicing unnaturalnselection and non-random mutation. 
 So let me explain these things.,This is natural selection.,This is unnatural selection. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what happens with this stuff is,,we started breeding wolvesnthousands of years ago,in central Asia to turn them into dogs.,And then we startednturning them into big dogs,and into little dogs.,But if you take one of the chihuahuas,you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue,and you let it loose on the African plain,,you can watch natural selection happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 Few things on Earthnare less natural than a cornfield.,You will never, under any scenario,nwalk through a virgin forest,and see the same plantngrowing in orderly rows,at the same time,,nothing else living there.,When you do a cornfield,,you're selecting what lives and what dies.,And you're doing thatnthrough unnatural selection.,It's the same with a wheat field,nit's the same with a rice field.,It's the same with a city,nit's the same with a suburb.,In fact, half the surface of Earth,has been unnaturally engineered,so that what lives and what diesnthere is what we want,,which is the reason whynyou don't have grizzly bears,walking through downtown Manhattan. 
 How about this random mutation stuff?,Well, this is random mutation.,This is Antonio Alfonseca.,He's otherwise knownnas the Octopus, his nickname.,He was the Relief Pitchernof the Year in 2000.,And he had a random mutationnthat gave him six fingers,on each hand,,which turns out to be really usefulnif you're a pitcher. 
 (Laughter) 
 How about non-random mutation?,A non-random mutation is beer.,It's wine. It's yogurt.,How many times have you walkednthrough the forest,and found all-natural cheese?,Or all-natural yogurt?,So we've been engineering this stuff.,Now, the interesting thing is,,we get to know the stuff better.,We found one of the single most powerfulngene-editing instruments,,CRISPR, inside yogurt.,And as we start engineering cells,,we're producing eight out of the top 10npharmaceutical products,,including the stuff that you usento treat arthritis,,which is the number onenbest-selling drug, Humira. 
 So this lifecode stuff.,It really is a superpower.,It really is a way of programming stuff,,and there's nothingnthat's going to change us,more than this lifecode.,So as you're thinking of lifecode,,let's think of five principles,as to how we start guiding,,and I'd love you to give me more. 
 So, principle number one:,we have to take responsibilitynfor this stuff.,The reason we have to take responsibility,is because we're in charge.,These aren't random mutations.,This is what we are doing,nwhat we are choosing.,It's not, "Stuff happened.",It didn't happen at random.,It didn't come downnby a verdict of somebody else.,We engineer this stuff,,and it's the Pottery Barn rule:nyou break it, you own it. 
 Principle number two:,we have to recognize and celebratendiversity in this stuff.,There have been at leastn33 versions of hominids,that have walked around this Earth.,Most all of them went extinct except us.,But the normal and naturalnstate of this Earth,is we have various versions of humansnwalking around at the same time,,which is why most of usnhave some Neanderthal in us.,Some of us have some Denisova in us.,And some in Washingtonnhave a lot more of it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Principle number three:,we have to respect other people's choices.,Some people will choose to never alter.,Some people will choose to alter all.,Some people will choosento alter plants but not animals.,Some people will choosento alter themselves.,Some people will choosento evolve themselves.,Diversity is not a bad thing,,because even though we thinknof humans as very diverse,,we came so close to extinction,that all of us descendnfrom a single African mother,and the consequence of that,is there's more genetic diversitynin 55 African chimpanzees,than there are in seven billion humans. 
 Principle number four:,we should take aboutna quarter of the Earth,and only let Darwin run the show there.,It doesn't have to be contiguous,,doesn't have to all be tied together.,It should be partnin the oceans, part on land.,But we should not run everynevolutionary decision on this planet.,We want to havenour evolutionary system running.,We want to have Darwin'snevolutionary system running.,And it's just really important to haventhese two things running in parallel,and not overwhelm evolution. 
 (Applause) 
 Last thing I'll say.,This is the single most excitingnadventure human beings have been on.,This is the single greatest superpowernhumans have ever had.,It would be a crime for younnot to participate in this stuff,because you're scared of it,,because you're hiding from it.,You can participate in the ethics.nYou can participate in the politics.,You can participate in the business.,You can participate in just thinkingnabout where medicine is going,,where industry is going,,where we're going to take the world.,It would be a crime for all of us,not to be aware when somebodynshows up at a swimming pool,and says one word, just one word,,if you don't listennif that word is "lifecode." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)In the space that usednto house one transistor,,we can now fit one billion.,That made it so that a computernthe size of an entire room,now fits in your pocket.,You might say the future is small. 
 As an engineer,,I'm inspired by this miniaturizationnrevolution in computers.,As a physician,,I wonder whether we could use itnto reduce the number of lives lost,due to one of the fastest-growingndiseases on Earth:,cancer.,Now when I say that,,what most people hear me saynis that we're working on curing cancer.,And we are.,But it turns out,that there's an incrediblenopportunity to save lives,through the early detectionnand prevention of cancer. 
 Worldwide, over two-thirds of deathsndue to cancer are fully preventable,using methods that we alreadynhave in hand today.,Things like vaccination, timely screening,and of course, stopping smoking.,But even with the best toolsnand technologies that we have today,,some tumors can't be detected,until 10 years afternthey've started growing,,when they are 50 millionncancer cells strong.,What if we had better technologies,to detect some of these morendeadly cancers sooner,,when they could be removed,,when they were just getting started? 
 Let me tell you about hownminiaturization might get us there.,This is a microscope in a typical lab,that a pathologist would usenfor looking at a tissue specimen,,like a biopsy or a pap smear.,This $7,000 microscope,would be used by somebodynwith years of specialized training,to spot cancer cells.,This is an image from a colleaguenof mine at Rice University,,Rebecca Richards-Kortum.,What she and her team have donenis miniaturize that whole microscope,into this $10 part,,and it fits on the endnof an optical fiber.,Now what that means is insteadnof taking a sample from a patient,and sending it to the microscope,,you can bring the microscopento the patient.,And then, instead of requiringna specialist to look at the images,,you can train the computer to scorennormal versus cancerous cells. 
 Now this is important,,because what they foundnworking in rural communities,,is that even when they havena mobile screening van,that can go out into the communitynand perform exams,and collect samples,and send them to the centralnhospital for analysis,,that days later,,women get a callnwith an abnormal test result,and they're asked to come in.,Fully half of them don't turn upnbecause they can't afford the trip.,With the integrated microscopenand computer analysis,,Rebecca and her colleaguesnhave been able to create a van,that has both a diagnostic setupnand a treatment setup.,And what that meansnis that they can do a diagnosis,and perform therapy on the spot,,so no one is lost to follow up. 
 That's just one example of hownminiaturization can save lives.,Now as engineers,,we think of thisnas straight-up miniaturization.,You took a big thingnand you made it little.,But what I told you before about computers,was that they transformed our lives,when they became small enoughnfor us to take them everywhere.,So what is the transformationalnequivalent like that in medicine?,Well, what if you had a detector,that was so small that it couldncirculate in your body,,find the tumor all by itself,and send a signal to the outside world?,It sounds a little bitnlike science fiction.,But actually, nanotechnologynallows us to do just that.,Nanotechnology allows us to shrinknthe parts that make up the detector,from the width of a human hair,,which is 100 microns,,to a thousand times smaller,,which is 100 nanometers.,And that has profound implications. 
 It turns out that materialsnactually change their properties,at the nanoscale.,You take a common material like gold,,and you grind it into dust,ninto gold nanoparticles,,and it changes from lookingngold to looking red.,If you take a more exotic materialnlike cadmium selenide --,forms a big, black crystal --,if you make nanocrystalsnout of this material,and you put it in a liquid,,and you shine light on it,,they glow.,And they glow blue, green,nyellow, orange, red,,depending only on their size.,It's wild! Can you imagine an objectnlike that in the macro world?,It would be like all the denim jeansnin your closet are all made of cotton,,but they are different colorsndepending only on their size. 
 (Laughter) 
 So as a physician,,what's just as interesting to me,is that it's not justnthe color of materials,that changes at the nanoscale;,the way they travelnin your body also changes.,And this is the kind of observationnthat we're going to use,to make a better cancer detector. 
 So let me show you what I mean.,This is a blood vessel in the body.,Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.,We're going to inject nanoparticlesninto the blood vessel,and watch how they travelnfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.,Now it turns out that the blood vesselsnof many tumors are leaky,,and so nanoparticles can leak outnfrom the bloodstream into the tumor.,Whether they leak outndepends on their size.,So in this image,,the smaller, hundred-nanometer,nblue nanoparticles are leaking out,,and the larger, 500-nanometer,nred nanoparticles,are stuck in the bloodstream.,So that means as an engineer,,depending on how bignor small I make a material,,I can change where it goes in your body. 
 In my lab, we recently madena cancer nanodetector,that is so small that it could travelninto the body and look for tumors.,We designed it to listennfor tumor invasion:,the orchestra of chemical signalsnthat tumors need to make to spread.,For a tumor to break outnof the tissue that it's born in,,it has to make chemicals called enzymes,to chew throughnthe scaffolding of tissues.,We designed these nanoparticlesnto be activated by these enzymes.,One enzyme can activate a thousandnof these chemical reactions in an hour.,Now in engineering, we callnthat one-to-a-thousand ratio,a form of amplification,,and it makes something ultrasensitive.,So we've made an ultrasensitivencancer detector. 
 OK, but how do I get this activatednsignal to the outside world,,where I can act on it?,For this, we're going to usenone more piece of nanoscale biology,,and that has to do with the kidney.,The kidney is a filter.,Its job is to filter out the bloodnand put waste into the urine.,It turns out that what the kidney filters,is also dependent on size.,So in this image, what you can see,is that everything smallernthan five nanometers,is going from the blood,nthrough the kidney, into the urine,,and everything elsenthat's bigger is retained.,OK, so if I make a 100-nanometerncancer detector,,I inject it in the bloodstream,,it can leak into the tumornwhere it's activated by tumor enzymes,to release a small signal,that is small enough to benfiltered out of the kidney,and put into the urine,,I have a signal in the outside worldnthat I can detect. 
 OK, but there's one more problem.,This is a tiny little signal,,so how do I detect it?,Well, the signal is just a molecule.,They're moleculesnthat we designed as engineers.,They're completely synthetic,nand we can design them,so they are compatiblenwith our tool of choice.,If we want to use a reallynsensitive, fancy instrument,called a mass spectrometer,,then we make a moleculenwith a unique mass.,Or maybe we want make somethingnthat's more inexpensive and portable.,Then we make moleculesnthat we can trap on paper,,like a pregnancy test.,In fact, there's a wholenworld of paper tests,that are becoming availablenin a field called paper diagnostics. 
 Alright, where are we going with this?,What I'm going to tell you next,,as a lifelong researcher,,represents a dream of mine.,I can't say that's it's a promise;,it's a dream.,But I think we all have to have dreamsnto keep us pushing forward,,even -- and maybe especially --ncancer researchers. 
 I'm going to tell you what I hopenwill happen with my technology,,that my team and I will putnour hearts and souls,into making a reality.,OK, here goes.,I dream that one day,,instead of going intonan expensive screening facility,to get a colonoscopy,,or a mammogram,,or a pap smear,,that you could get a shot,,wait an hour,,and do a urine test on a paper strip.,I imagine that this could even happen,without the need for steady electricity,,or a medical professional in the room.,Maybe they could be far away,and connected only by the imagenon a smartphone. 
 Now I know this sounds like a dream,,but in the lab we alreadynhave this working in mice,,where it works betternthan existing methods,for the detection of lung,ncolon and ovarian cancer.,And I hope that what this means,is that one day we canndetect tumors in patients,sooner than 10 yearsnafter they've started growing,,in all walks of life,,all around the globe,,and that this would leadnto earlier treatments,,and that we could save more livesnthan we can today,,with early detection. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I consider it my life's mission,to convey the urgencynof climate change through my work.,I've traveled north to the Arcticnto the capture the unfolding story,of polar melt,,and south to the Equator to documentnthe subsequent rising seas.,Most recently, I visitednthe icy coast of Greenland,and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,,connecting two seemingly disparatenbut equally endangered,parts of our planet. 
 My drawings explore momentsnof transition, turbulence,and tranquility in the landscape,,allowing viewers to emotionally connect,with a place you might nevernhave the chance to visit.,I choose to convey the beautynas opposed to the devastation.,If you can experience the sublimitynof these landscapes,,perhaps you'll be inspirednto protect and preserve them. 
 Behavioral psychology tells usnthat we take action,and make decisions basednon our emotions above all else.,And studies have shownnthat art impacts our emotions,more effectively than a scary news report.,Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers,as early as 2020.,And sea levels are likely to risenbetween two and ten feet,by century's end.,I have dedicated my careernto illuminating these projections,with an accessible medium,,one that moves us in a waynthat statistics may not. 
 My process beginsnwith traveling to the places,at the forefront of climate change.,On-site, I take thousands of photographs.,Back in the studio,,I work from both my memorynof the experience and the photographs,to create very large-scale compositions,,sometimes over 10 feet wide. 
 I draw with soft pastel, which is drynlike charcoal, but colors.,I consider my work drawingsnbut others call them painting.,I cringe, though, when I'm referred tonas a "finger painter." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I don't use any tools,and I have always usednmy fingers and palms,to manipulate the pigment on the paper.,Drawing is a form of meditation for me.,It quiets my mind.,I don't perceive what I'm drawing,as ice or water.,Instead, the image is stripped down,to its most basic form of color and shape.,Once the piece is complete,,I can finally experiencenthe composition as a whole,,as an iceberg floatingnthrough glassy water,,or a wave cresting with foam.,On average, a piece this sizentakes me about,,as you can see, 10 seconds. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Really, more like 200 hours,n250 hours for something that size.,But I've been drawing ever sincenI could hold a crayon, really.,My mom was an artist, and growing up,,we always had art suppliesnall over the house.,My mother's love of photography,propelled her to the mostnremote regions of the earth,,and my family and I were fortunate enough,to join and support hernon these adventures.,We rode camels in Northern Africa,and mushed on dog sledsnnear the North Pole. 
 In August of 2012,nI led my first expedition,,taking a group of artists and scholarsnup the northwest coast of Greenland.,My mother was originallynsupposed to lead this trip.,She and I were in the earlynstages of planning,,as we had intended to go together,,when she fell victim to a brain tumor.,The cancer quickly took overnher body and mind,,and she passed away six months later.,During the months of her illness, though,,her dedication to the expeditionnnever wavered, and I made a promise,to carry out her final journey. 
 My mother's passion for the Arctic,echoed through my experience in Greenland,,and I felt the power,and the fragility of the landscape.,The sheer size of the icebergs,is humbling.,The ice fields are alivenwith movement and sound,in a way that I never expected.,I expanded the scale of my compositions,to give you that same sense of awenthat I experienced.,Yet, while the grandeurnof the ice is evident,,so, too, is its vulnerability.,From our boat,,I could see the ice sweatingnunder the unseasonably warm sun. 
 We had a chance to visitnmany of the Inuit communities in Greenland,that now face huge challenges.,The locals spoke to menof vast areas of sea ice,that are no longernfreezing over as they once did.,And without ice, their huntingnand harvesting grounds,are severely diminished,,threatening their waynof life and survival. 
 The melting glaciers in Greenland,are one of the largestncontributing factors to rising sea levels,,which have already begun to drown,some of our world's lowest-lying islands.,One year after my trip to Greenland,nI visited the Maldives,,the lowest and flattest countrynin the entire world.,While I was there, I collectednimages and inspiration,for a new body of work:,drawings of waves lappingnon the coast of a nation,that could be entirely underwaternwithin this century. 
 Devastating events happen every day,on scales both global and personal.,When I was in Greenland,,I scattered my mother's ashesnamidst the melting ice.,Now she remains a partnof the landscape she loved so much,,even as it, too, passesnand takes on new form. 
 Among the many gifts my mother gave me,was the ability to focus on the positive,,rather than the negative.,My drawings celebrate the beautynof what we all stand to lose.,I hope they can serve as recordsnof sublime landscapes in flux,,documenting the transitionnand inspiring our global community,to take action for the future. 
 Thank you.

 Trevor Copp: When "Dancing With the Stars"nfirst hit the airwaves,,that is not what it looked like. 
 (Laughter) 
 Jeff and I were full-timenballroom dance instructors,when the big TV ballroom revival hit,,and this was incredible.,I mean, one day we would say "foxtrot,",and people were like "Foxes trotting." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the next day they were telling us,the finer points of a good feather step.,And this blew our minds.,I mean, all of the ballroom dancengeeking out that we had always done,on why salsa worked differentlynthan the competitive rumba,and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,,all of that just hitnthe public consciousness,,and it changed everything. 
 But running parallel to this excitement,,the excitement that suddenly,nsomehow, we were cool -- 
 (Laughter) 
 there was also this reservation.,Why this and why now? 
 Jeff Fox: When Trevor and Inwould get together for training seminars,or just for fun,,we'd toss each other around, mix it up,,take a break from havingnto lead all the time.,We even came up with a systemnfor switching lead and follow,while we were dancing,,as a way of taking turns and playing fair.,It wasn't until we used that systemnas part of a performance,in a small festival,that we got an important tapnon the shoulder.,Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturgenand director of a playwright center,,pulled us aside after the show and said,,"Do you have any ideanhow political that was?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So that began an eight-yearncollaboration to create a play,which not only further developednour system for switching,but also explored the impactnof being locked into a single role,,and what's worse,,being defined by that single role. 
 TC: Because, of course,,classic Latin and ballroom dancingnisn't just a system of dancing;,it's a way of thinking, of being,,of relating to each other,that captured a whole period's values.,There's one thing that stayednconsistent, though:,the man leads,and the woman follows.,So street salsa, championship tango,nit's all the same --,he leads, she follows. 
 So this was gender training.,You weren't just learning to dance --,you were learning to "man" and to "woman.",It's a relic.,And in the way of relics,nyou don't throw it out,,but you need to knownthat this is the past.,This isn't the present.,It's like Shakespeare:nrespect it, revive it -- great!,But know that this is history.,This doesn't represent how we think today. 
 So we asked ourselves:,If you strip it all down,,what is at the core of partner dancing? 
 JF: Well, the core principlenof partner dancing,is that one person leads,nthe other one follows.,The machine works the same,nregardless of who's playing which role.,The physics of movement doesn't reallyngive a crap about your gender. 
 (Laughter) 
 So if we were to update the existing form,,we would need to make itnmore representative,of how we interact here, now, in 2015.,When you watch ballroom,ndon't just watch what's there.,Watch what's not.,The couple is alwaysnonly a man and a woman.,Together.,Only.,Ever.,So, same-sex and gender nonconformistncouples just disappear.,In most mainstream internationalnballroom competitions,,same-sex couples are rarelynrecognized on the floor,,and in many cases,,the rules prohibit them completely. 
 TC: Try this: Google-image,n"professional Latin dancer,",and then look for an actual Latino person. 
 (Laughter) 
 You'll be there for days.,What you will get is page after pagenof white, straight Russian couples,spray-tanned to the point of mahogany. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are no black people,nthere are no Asians,,no mixed-race couples,,so basically, non-white peoplenjust disappeared. 
 Even within the white-straight-ncouple-only paradigm --,she can't be taller,,he can't be shorter.,She can't be bolder,,he can't be gentler. 
 If you were to take a ballroom dance,and translate that into a conversation,and drop that into a movie,,we, as a culture,nwould never stand for this.,He dictates, she reacts.,No relationship -- gay,nstraight or anything --,that we would regard as remotely healthynor functional looks like that,,and yet somehow,,you put it on prime time,nyou slap some makeup on it,,throw the glitter on, put it out therenas movement, not as text,,and we, as a culture,,tune in and clap.,We are applauding our own absence.,Too many people have disappearednfrom partner dancing. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 JF: Now, you just sawntwo men dancing together. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you thought it looked ...,a little strange.,Interesting -- appealing, even --,but a little bit odd.,Even avid followers of the same-sexnballroom circuit can attest,that while same-sex partner dancingncan be dynamic and strong and exciting,,it just doesn't quite seem to fit.,Aesthetically speaking,,if Alida and I take the classicnclosed ballroom hold ...,this is considered beautiful. 
 (Laughter) 
 But why not this? 
 (Laughter) 
 See, the standard image that the leadernmust be larger and masculine,and the follower smaller and feminine --,this is a stumbling point. 
 TC: So we wanted to look at thisnfrom a totally different angle.,So, what if we could keepnthe idea of lead and follow,but toss the idea that thisnwas connected to gender?,Further, what if a couplencould lead and follow each other,and then switch?,And then switch back?,What if it could be like a conversation,,taking turns listening and speaking,njust like we do in life?,What if we could dance like that?,We call it "Liquid Lead Dancing." 
 JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,,salsa.,In salsa, there's a key transitional step,ncalled the cross-body lead.,We use it as punctuationnto break up the improvisation.,It can be a little tricky to spotnif you're not used to looking for it,,so here it is.,One more time for the cheap seats. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here's the action one more time,,nice and slow.,Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinkingnto this transitional step,,the cross-body lead becomes a point,where the lead and the follow can switch.,The person following can electnto take over the lead,,or the person leading can choosento surrender it,,essentially making itna counter-cross-body lead.,Here's how that looks in slow motion.,And here's how it lookednwhen we danced it in the opening dance. 
 With this simple tweak,nthe dance moves from being a dictation,to a negotiation.,Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.,And more importantly,nyou can change your mind.,Now, this is only one examplenof how this applies,,but once the blinkers come off,nanything can happen. 
 TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinkingncould apply to a classic waltz.,Because, of course,,it isn't just a system of switching leads;,it's a way of thinking,that can actually makenthe dance itself more efficient. 
 So: the waltz.,The waltz is a turning dance.,This means that for the lead,,you spend half of the dancentraveling backwards,,completely blind.,And because of the follower's position,,basically, no one can seenwhere they're going. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you're out here on the floor,,and then imagine that coming right at you. 
 JF: Raaaaaah! 
 (Laughter) 
 TC: There are actually a lotnof accidents out there,that happen as a resultnof this blind spot.,But what if the partnersnwere to just allow for,a switch of posture for a moment?,A lot of accidents could be avoided.,Even if one person led the whole dancenbut allowed this switch to happen,,it would be a lot safer,,while at the same time,noffering new aesthetics into the waltz.,Because physics doesn't give a damnnabout your gender. 
 (Laughter) 
 JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Leadnin clubs, convention centers,and as part of "First Dance,"nthe play we created with Lisa,,on stages in North America and in Europe.,And it never fails to engage.,I mean, beyond the unusual sightnof seeing two men dancing together,,it always evokes and engages.,But why? 
 The secret lies in what madenLisa see our initial demonstration,as "political.",It wasn't just that we werenswitching lead and follow;,it's that we stayed consistentnin our presence, our personality,and our power, regardlessnof which role we were playing.,We were still us. 
 And that's where the true freedom lies --,not just the freedom to switch roles,,but the freedom from being definednby whichever role you're playing,,the freedom to always remainntrue to yourself.,Forget what a lead is supposednto look like, or a follow.,Be a masculine follow,or a feminine lead.,Just be yourself.,Obviously, this appliesnoff the dance floor as well,,but on the floor, it gives usnthe perfect opportunity,to update an old paradigm,nreinvigorate an old relic,,and make it more representativenof our era and our current way of being. 
 TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancingnall the time with women and men,and we love it.,But we dance with a consciousnessnthat this is a historic form,that can produce silencenand produce invisibility,across the spectrum of identitynthat we enjoy today.,We invented Liquid Lead,as a way of stripping outnall the ideas that don't belong to us,and taking partner dancing backnto what it really always was:,the fine art of taking care of each other. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)I'm a painter.,I make large-scale figurative paintings,,which means I paint people,like this.,But I'm here tonight to tell younabout something personal,that changed my work and my perspective.,It's something we all go through,,and my hope is that my experiencenmay be helpful to somebody. 
 To give you some background on me,nI grew up the youngest of eight.,Yes, eight kids in my family.,I have six older brothers and a sister.,To give you a sense of what that's like,,when my family went on vacation,,we had a bus. 
 (Laughter) 
 My supermom would drive us all over town,to our various after-school activities --,not in the bus.,We had a regular car, too.,She would take me to art classes,,and not just one or two.,She took me to every available art classnfrom when I was eight to 16,,because that's all I wanted to do.,She even took a class with menin New York City. 
 Now, being the youngest of eight,nI learned a few survival skills.,Rule number one:,don't let your big brothernsee you do anything stupid.,So I learned to be quiet and neat,and careful to follow the rulesnand stay in line. 
 But painting was where I made the rules.,That was my private world.,By 14, I knew I really wantednto be an artist.,My big plan was to be a waitressnto support my painting.,So I continued honing my skills.,I went to graduate schoolnand I got an MFA,,and at my first solo show,nmy brother asked me,,"What do all these red dotsnmean next to the paintings?",Nobody was more surprised than me.,The red dots meantnthat the paintings were sold,and that I'd be able to pay my rent,with painting.,Now, my apartmentnhad four electrical outlets,,and I couldn't use a microwavenand a toaster at the same time,,but still, I could pay my rent.,So I was very happy. 
 Here's a paintingnfrom back around that time.,I needed it to benas realistic as possible.,It had to be specific and believable.,This was the place where I wasnisolated and in total control. 
 Since then, I've made a careernof painting people in water.,Bathtubs and showers werenthe perfect enclosed environment.,It was intimate and private,,and water was this complicated challengenthat kept me busy for a decade.,I made about 200 of these paintings,,some of them six to eight feet,,like this one.,For this painting, I mixed flour innwith the bathwater to make it cloudy,and I floated cooking oil on the surface,and stuck a girl in it,,and when I lit it up,,it was so beautifulnI couldn't wait to paint it.,I was driven by thisnkind of impulsive curiosity,,always looking for something new to add:,vinyl, steam, glass.,I once put all this Vaselinenin my head and hair,just to see what that would look like.,Don't do that. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it was going well.,I was finding my way.,I was eager and motivated,and surrounded by artists,,always going to openings and events.,I was having some success and recognition,and I moved into an apartmentnwith more than four outlets.,My mom and I would stay up very late,talking about our latest ideasnand inspiring each other.,She made beautiful pottery. 
 I have a friend named Bonwho made this painting,of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,,and he called it "The Light Years.",I asked him what that meant, and he said,,"Well, that's when you've steppedninto adulthood, you're no longer a child,,but you're not yet weighed downnby the responsibilities of life.",That was it. It was the light years. 
 On October 8, 2011,,the light years came to an end.,My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.,It had spread to her bones,nand it was in her brain.,When she told me this, I fell to my knees.,I totally lost it.,And when I got myself togethernand I looked at her,,I realized, this isn't about me.,This is about figuring outnhow to help her.,My father is a doctor,,and so we had a great advantagenhaving him in charge,,and he did a beautiful jobntaking care of her.,But I, too, wanted to doneverything I could to help,,so I wanted to try everything.,We all did.,I researched alternative medicines,,diets, juicing, acupuncture.,Finally, I asked her,,"Is this what you want me to do?",And she said, "No.",She said, "Pace yourself.nI'm going to need you later." 
 She knew what was happening,,and she knew what the doctors,and the expertsnand the internet didn't know:,how she wanted to go through this.,I just needed to ask her.,I realized that if I tried to fix it,,I would miss it.,So I just started to be with her,,whatever that meantnand whatever situation came up,,just really listen to her.,If before I was resisting,nthen now I was surrendering,,giving up trying to controlnthe uncontrollable,and just being there in it with her.,Time slowed down,,and the date was irrelevant. 
 We developed a routine.,Early each morning I would crawlninto bed with her and sleep with her.,My brother would come for breakfast,and we'd be so glad to hearnhis car coming up the driveway.,So I'd help her up and take both her hands,and help her walk to the kitchen.,She had this huge mug she made,she loved to drink her coffee out of,,and she loved Irish soda breadnfor breakfast.,Afterwards was the shower,,and she loved this part.,She loved the warm water,,so I made this as indulgent as I could,,like a spa.,My sister would help sometimes.,We had warm towels,and slippers ready immediately,so she never got cold for a second.,I'd blow-dry her hair.,My brothers would come in the eveningsnand bring their kids,,and that was the highlight of her day. 
 Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,,and she didn't want to eat so much,,and she used the tiniest little teacupnwe could find to drink her coffee.,I couldn't support her myself anymore,,so we hired an aidento help me with the showers. 
 These simple daily activities,became our sacred ritual,,and we repeated them day after day,as the cancer grew.,It was humbling and painful,and exactly where I wanted to be.,We called this time "the beautiful awful." 
 She died on October 26, 2012.,It was a year and three weeksnafter her diagnosis.,She was gone.,My brothers, sister, and father and I,all came together in thisnsupportive and attentive way.,It was as though our whole family dynamic,and all our established roles vanished,and we were justnall together in this unknown,,feeling the same thing,and taking care of each other.,I'm so grateful for them. 
 As someone who spends mostnof my time alone in a studio working,,I had no idea that this kind of connection,could be so important, so healing.,This was the most important thing.,It was what I always wanted. 
 So after the funeral, it was timenfor me to go back to my studio.,So I packed up my carnand I drove back to Brooklyn,,and painting is what I've always done,nso that's what I did.,And here's what happened.,It's like a release of everythingnthat was unraveling in me.,That safe, very, very carefullynrendered safe place,that I created in all my other paintings,,it was a myth.,It didn't work.,And I was afraid, becausenI didn't want to paint anymore. 
 So I went into the woods.,I thought, I'll try that, going outside.,I got my paints,nand I wasn't a landscape painter,,but I wasn't reallynmuch of any kind of painter at all,,so I had no attachment, no expectation,,which allowed me to be reckless and free.,I actually left one of these wet paintings,outside overnight,next to a light in the woods.,By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.,But I didn't care.nIt didn't matter. It didn't matter.,I took all these paintingsnback to my studio,,and scraped them, and carved into them,,and poured paint thinner on them,,put more paint on top, drew on them.,I had no plan,,but I was watching what was happening. 
 This is the one with all the bugs in it.,I wasn't trying to represent a real space.,It was the chaos and the imperfectionsnthat were fascinating me,,and something started to happen.,I got curious again.,This is another one from the woods. 
 There was a caveat now, though.,I couldn't be controllingnthe paint like I used to.,It had to be about implyingnand suggesting,,not explaining or describing.,And that imperfect,nchaotic, turbulent surface,is what told the story.,I started to be as curiousnas I was when I was a student. 
 So the next thing was I wantednto put figures in these paintings, people,,and I loved this new environment,,so I wanted to havenboth people and this atmosphere.,When the idea hit me of how to do this,,I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,,which is really just adrenaline, probably,,but for me it's a really good sign. 
 And so now I want to show younwhat I've been working on.,It's something I haven't shown yet,nand it's like a preview, I guess,,of my upcoming show,,what I have so far.,Expansive space,instead of the isolated bathtub.,I'm going outside instead of inside.,Loosening control,,savoring the imperfections,,allowing the --,allowing the imperfections.,And in that imperfection,,you can find a vulnerability.,I could feel my deepest intention,nwhat matters most to me,,that human connection,that can happen in a spacenwhere there's no resisting or controlling.,I want to make paintings about that. 
 So here's what I learned.,We're all going to havenbig losses in our lives,,maybe a job or a career,,relationships, love, our youth.,We're going to lose our health,,people we love.,These kinds of lossesnare out of our control.,They're unpredictable,,and they bring us to our knees.,And so I say, let them.,Fall to your knees. Be humbled.,Let go of trying to change it,or even wanting it to be different.,It just is.,And then there's space,,and in that space feel your vulnerability,,what matters most to you,,your deepest intention.,And be curious to connect,to what and who is really here,,awake and alive.,It's what we all want. 
 Let's take the opportunitynto find something beautiful,in the unknown, in the unpredictable,,and even in the awful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So when you look outnat the stars at night,,it's amazing what you can see.,It's beautiful.,But what's more amazingnis what you can't see,,because what we know now,is that around every starnor almost every star,,there's a planet,,or probably a few. 
 So what this picture isn't showing you,are all the planets that we know about,out there in space.,But when we think about planets,nwe tend to think of faraway things,that are very different from our own.,But here we are on a planet,,and there are so many thingsnthat are amazing about Earth,that we're searching far and widento find things that are like that.,And when we're searching,nwe're finding amazing things.,But I want to tell younabout an amazing thing here on Earth.,And that is that every minute,,400 pounds of hydrogen,and almost seven pounds of helium,escape from Earth into space.,And this is gas that is going offnand never coming back.,So hydrogen, helium and many other things,make up what's knownnas the Earth's atmosphere.,The atmosphere is just these gasesnthat form a thin blue line,that's seen here fromnthe International Space Station,,a photograph that some astronauts took.,And this tenuous veneer around our planet,is what allows life to flourish.,It protects our planetnfrom too many impacts,,from meteorites and the like.,And it's such an amazing phenomenon,that the fact that it's disappearing,should frighten you,nat least a little bit. 
 So this process is something that I study,and it's called atmospheric escape.,So atmospheric escapenis not specific to planet Earth.,It's part of what it meansnto be a planet, if you ask me,,because planets, not just here on Earthnbut throughout the universe,,can undergo atmospheric escape.,And the way it happens actually tells usnabout planets themselves.,Because when you thinknabout the solar system,,you might think about this picture here.,And you would say, well,nthere are eight planets, maybe nine.,So for those of younwho are stressed by this picture,,I will add somebody for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Courtesy of New Horizons,nwe're including Pluto.,And the thing here is,,for the purposes of this talknand atmospheric escape,,Pluto is a planet in my mind,,in the same way that planetsnaround other stars that we can't see,are also planets.,So fundamental characteristics of planets,include the fact that they are bodies,that are bound together by gravity.,So it's a lot of materialnjust stuck together,with this attractive force.,And these bodies are so bignand have so much gravity.,That's why they're round.,So when you look at all of these,,including Pluto,,they're round. 
 So you can see that gravitynis really at play here.,But another fundamentalncharacteristic about planets,is what you don't see here,,and that's the star, the Sun,,that all of the planetsnin the solar system are orbiting around.,And that's fundamentally drivingnatmospheric escape.,The reason that fundamentally starsndrive atmospheric escape from planets,is because stars offer planetsnparticles and light and heat,that can cause the atmospheres to go away.,So if you think of a hot-air balloon,,or you look at this picturenof lanterns in Thailand at a festival,,you can see that hot airncan propel gasses upward.,And if you have enough energy and heating,,which our Sun does,,that gas, which is so lightnand only bound by gravity,,it can escape into space.,And so this is what's actuallyncausing atmospheric escape,here on Earth and also on other planets --,that interplaynbetween heating from the star,and overcoming the forcenof gravity on the planet. 
 So I've told you that it happens,at the rate of 400 poundsna minute for hydrogen,and almost seven pounds for helium.,But what does that look like?,Well, even in the '80s,,we took pictures of the Earth,in the ultraviolet,using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.,So these two images of the Earth,show you what that glownof escaping hydrogen looks like,,shown in red.,And you can also see other featuresnlike oxygen and nitrogen,in that white glimmer,in the circle showing you the auroras,and also some wisps around the tropics.,So these are picturesnthat conclusively show us,that our atmosphere isn't justntightly bound to us here on Earth,but it's actuallynreaching out far into space,,and at an alarming rate, I might add. 
 But the Earth is not alonenin undergoing atmospheric escape.,Mars, our nearest neighbor,nis much smaller than Earth,,so it has much less gravitynwith which to hold on to its atmosphere.,And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,,we can see it's much thinnernthan the Earth's.,Just look at the surface.,You see craters indicatingnthat it didn't have an atmosphere,that could stop those impacts.,Also, we see that it's the "red planet,",and atmospheric escape plays a role,in Mars being red.,That's because we thinknMars used to have a wetter past,,and when water had enough energy,nit broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,,and hydrogen being so light,nit escaped into space,,and the oxygen that was left,oxidized or rusted the ground,,making that familiarnrusty red color that we see. 
 So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars,and say that atmospheric escapenprobably happened,,but NASA has a probe that's currentlynat Mars called the MAVEN satellite,,and its actual jobnis to study atmospheric escape.,It's the Mars Atmospherenand Volatile Evolution spacecraft.,And results from it have alreadynshown pictures very similar,to what you've seen here on Earth.,We've long known that Marsnwas losing its atmosphere,,but we have some stunning pictures.,Here, for example,nyou can see in the red circle,is the size of Mars,,and in blue you can see the hydrogennescaping away from the planet.,So it's reaching out more than 10 timesnthe size of the planet,,far enough away that it'snno longer bound to that planet.,It's escaping off into space.,And this helps us confirm ideas,,like why Mars is red,nfrom that lost hydrogen.,But hydrogen isn'tnthe only gas that's lost.,I mentioned helium on Earthnand some oxygen and nitrogen,,and from MAVEN we can also looknat the oxygen being lost from Mars.,And you can seenthat because oxygen is heavier,,it can't get as far as the hydrogen,,but it's still escapingnaway from the planet.,You don't see it all confinedninto that red circle. 
 So the fact that we not only seenatmospheric escape on our own planet,but we can study it elsewherenand send spacecraft,allows us to learnnabout the past of planets,but also about planets in general,and Earth's future.,So one way we actuallyncan learn about the future,is by planets so far awaynthat we can't see.,And I should just note though,nbefore I go on to that,,I'm not going to show younphotos like this of Pluto,,which might be disappointing,,but that's because we don't have them yet.,But the New Horizons missionnis currently studying atmospheric escape,being lost from the planet.,So stay tuned and look out for that.,But the planetsnthat I did want to talk about,are known as transiting exoplanets. 
 So any planet orbiting a starnthat's not our Sun,is called an exoplanet,nor extrasolar planet.,And these planets that we call transiting,have the special feature,that if you looknat that star in the middle,,you'll see that actually it's blinking.,And the reason that it's blinking,is because there are planetsnthat are going past it all the time,,and it's that special orientation,where the planets are blockingnthe light from the star,that allows us to see that light blinking.,And by surveying the starsnin the night sky,for this blinking motion,,we are able to find planets.,This is how we've now been ablento detect over 5,000 planets,in our own Milky Way,,and we know there arenmany more out there, like I mentioned. 
 So when we look at the lightnfrom these stars,,what we see, like I said,nis not the planet itself,,but you actually seena dimming of the light,that we can record in time.,So the light drops as the planetndecreases in front of the star,,and that's that blinkingnthat you saw before.,So not only do we detect the planets,but we can look at this lightnin different wavelengths.,So I mentioned looking at the Earthnand Mars in ultraviolet light.,If we look at transiting exoplanetsnwith the Hubble Space Telescope,,we find that in the ultraviolet,,you see much bigger blinking,nmuch less light from the star,,when the planet is passing in front.,And we think this is because you havenan extended atmosphere of hydrogen,all around the planet,that's making it look puffier,and thus blockingnmore of the light that you see. 
 So using this technique,nwe've actually been able to discover,a few transiting exoplanetsnthat are undergoing atmospheric escape.,And these planetsncan be called hot Jupiters,,for some of the ones we've found.,And that's becausenthey're gas planets like Jupiter,,but they're so close to their star,,about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.,And because there's all thisnlightweight gas that's ready to escape,,and all this heating from the star,,you have completely catastrophic ratesnof atmospheric escape.,So unlike our 400 pounds per minutenof hydrogen being lost on Earth,,for these planets,,you're losing 1.3 billionnpounds of hydrogen every minute. 
 So you might think, well,ndoes this make the planet cease to exist?,And this is a questionnthat people wondered,when they looked at our solar system,,because planetsncloser to the Sun are rocky,,and planets further awaynare bigger and more gaseous.,Could you have startednwith something like Jupiter,that was actually close to the Sun,,and get rid of all the gas in it?,We now think that if you startnwith something like a hot Jupiter,,you actually can't end upnwith Mercury or the Earth.,But if you started with something smaller,,it's possible that enough gasnwould have gotten away,that it would havensignificantly impacted it,and left you with something very differentnthan what you started with. 
 So all of this sounds sort of general,,and we might think about the solar system,,but what does this have to donwith us here on Earth?,Well, in the far future,,the Sun is going to get brighter.,And as that happens,,the heating that we find from the Sunnis going to become very intense.,In the same way that you seengas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,,gas is going to stream off from the Earth.,And so what we can look forward to,,or at least prepare for,,is the fact that in the far future,,the Earth is going to look more like Mars.,Our hydrogen, from waternthat is broken down,,is going to escapeninto space more rapidly,,and we're going to be leftnwith this dry, reddish planet. 
 So don't fear, it's notnfor a few billion years,,so there's some time to prepare. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I wanted younto be aware of what's going on,,not just in the future,,but atmospheric escapenis happening as we speak.,So there's a lot of amazing sciencenthat you hear about happening in space,and planets that are far away,,and we are studying these planetsnto learn about these worlds.,But as we learn about Marsnor exoplanets like hot Jupiters,,we find things like atmospheric escape,that tell us a lot morenabout our planet here on Earth. 
 So consider that the next timenyou think that space is far away. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)People returning to worknafter a career break:,I call them relaunchers.,These are people who have takenncareer breaks for elder care,,for childcare reasons,,pursuing a personal interest,or a personal health issue.,Closely related arencareer transitioners of all kinds:,veterans, military spouses,,retirees coming out of retirement,or repatriating expats.,Returning to worknafter a career break is hard,because of a disconnectnbetween the employers,and the relaunchers.,Employers can view hiring peoplenwith a gap on their resume,as a high-risk proposition,,and individuals on career breakncan have doubts about their abilities,to relaunch their careers,,especially if they've been outnfor a long time.,This disconnect is a problemnthat I'm trying to help solve. 
 Now, successful relaunchersnare everywhere and in every field.,This is Sami Kafala.,He's a nuclear physicist in the UK,who took a five-year career breaknto be home with his five children.,The Singapore press recently wrotenabout nurses returning to work,after long career breaks.,And speaking of long career breaks,,this is Mimi Kahn.,She's a social workernin Orange County, California,,who returned to worknin a social services organization,after a 25-year career break.,That's the longest career breaknthat I'm aware of.,Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,took a five-year career breaknearly in her career. 
 And this is Tracy Shapiro,nwho took a 13-year career break.,Tracy answered a call for essaysnby the Today Show,from people who were tryingnto return to work,but having a difficult time of it.,Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of fivenwho loved her time at home,,but she had gone through a divorcenand needed to return to work,,plus she really wantednto bring work back into her life,because she loved working.,Tracy was doing what so many of us do,when we feel like we've put inna good day in the job search.,She was looking for a financenor accounting role,,and she had just spentnthe last nine months,very diligently researchingncompanies online,and applying for jobs with no results. 
 I met Tracy in June of 2011,,when the Today Show asked menif I could work with her,to see if I could help hernturn things around.,The first thing I told Tracynwas she had to get out of the house.,I told her she had to go publicnwith her job search,and tell everyone she knewnabout her interest in returning to work.,I also told her, "You are goingnto have a lot of conversations,that don't go anywhere.,Expect that, and don'tnbe discouraged by it.,There will be a handful,that ultimately leadnto a job opportunity." 
 I'll tell you what happenednwith Tracy in a little bit,,but I want to share with youna discovery that I made,when I was returning to work,after my own career break of 11 yearsnout of the full-time workforce.,And that is, that people's view of younis frozen in time.,What I mean by this is,nwhen you start to get in touch with people,and you get back in touchnwith those people from the past,,the people with whom you workednor went to school,,they are going to remember you as you were,before your career break.,And that's even if your sense of selfnhas diminished over time,,as happens with so many of us,the farther removed we arenfrom our professional identities.,So for example,nyou might think of yourself,as someone who looks like this.,This is me, crazy after a daynof driving around in my minivan.,Or here I am in the kitchen.,But those people from the past,,they don't know about any of this.,They only remember you as you were,,and it's a great confidence boostnto be back in touch with these people,and hear their enthusiasmnabout your interest in returning to work. 
 There's one more thing I remember vividlynfrom my own career break.,And that was that I hardly kept upnwith the business news.,My background is in finance,,and I hardly kept up with any news,when I was home caringnfor my four young children.,So I was afraid I'd go into an interview,and start talking about a companynthat didn't exist anymore.,So I had to resubscribento the Wall Street Journal,and read it for a good six monthsncover to cover before I felt,like I had a handle on what was going onnin the business world again. 
 I believe relaunchersnare a gem of the workforce,,and here's why.,Think about our life stage:,for those of us who took career breaksnfor childcare reasons,,we have fewer or no maternity leaves.,We did that already.,We have fewer spousalnor partner job relocations.,We're in a more settled time of life.,We have great work experience.,We have a more mature perspective.,We're not trying to find ourselvesnat an employer's expense.,Plus we have an energy,nan enthusiasm about returning to work,precisely because we've beennaway from it for a while. 
 On the flip side, I speak with employers,,and here are two concernsnthat employers have,about hiring relaunchers. 
 The first one is, employersnare worried that relaunchers,are technologically obsolete.,Now, I can tell you,,having been technologicallynobsolete myself at one point,,that it's a temporary condition.,I had done my financial analysisnso long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.,I don't know if anyonencan even remember back that far,,but I had to relearn it on Excel.,It actually wasn't that hard.nA lot of the commands are the same.,I found PowerPoint much more challenging,,but now I use PowerPoint all the time.,I tell relaunchers that employersnexpect them to come to the table,with a working knowledgenof basic office management software.,And if they're not up to speed,,then it's theirnresponsibility to get there.,And they do. 
 The second area of concernnthat employers have about relaunchers,is they're worried that relaunchersndon't know what they want to do.,I tell relaunchers that they neednto do the hard work,to figure out whether their interestsnand skills have changed,or have not changed,while they have been on career break.,That's not the employer's job.,It's the relauncher's responsibilitynto demonstrate to the employer,where they can add the most value. 
 Back in 2010 I started noticing something.,I had been trackingnreturn to work programs since 2008,,and in 2010, I started noticing,the use of a short-termnpaid work opportunity,,whether it was callednan internship or not,,but an internship-like experience,,as a way for professionalsnto return to work.,I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee,start corporate reentryninternship programs.,I saw a returning engineer,na nontraditional reentry candidate,,apply for an entry-levelninternship program in the military,,and then get a permanent job afterward.,I saw two universitiesnintegrate internships,into mid-career executiveneducation programs. 
 So I wrote a reportnabout what I was seeing,,and it became this articlenfor Harvard Business Review,called "The 40-Year-Old Intern.",I have to thank the editorsnthere for that title,,and also for this artwork,where you can see the 40-year-old internnin the midst of all the college interns.,And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,,they called the conceptn"The 50-Year-Old Intern." 
 (Laughter) 
 So five of the biggestnfinancial services companies,have reentry internship programsnfor returning finance professionals.,And at this point,nhundreds of people have participated.,These internships are paid,,and the people who move onnto permanent roles,are commanding competitive salaries.,And now, seven of the biggestnengineering companies,are piloting reentry internship programsnfor returning engineers,as part of an initiativenwith the Society of Women Engineers.,Now, why are companies embracingnthe reentry internship?,Because the internship allows the employer,to base their hiring decisionnon an actual work sample,instead of a series of interviews,,and the employer does not have to makenthat permanent hiring decision,until the internship period is over.,This testing out periodnremoves the perceived risk,that some managers attachnto hiring relaunchers,,and they are attractingnexcellent candidates,who are turning into great hires. 
 Think about how far we have come.,Before this, most employersnwere not interested,in engaging with relaunchers at all.,But now, not onlynare programs being developed,specifically with relaunchers in mind,,but you can't even applynfor these programs,unless you have a gap on your résumé. 
 This is the mark of real change,,of true institutional shift,,because if we can solventhis problem for relaunchers,,we can solve it for otherncareer transitioners too.,In fact, an employer just told me,that their veterans return to work program,is based on their reentryninternship program.,And there's no reason why there can't bena retiree internship program.,Different pool, same concept. 
 So let me tell younwhat happened with Tracy Shapiro.,Remember that she had to tellneveryone she knew,about her interest in returning to work.,Well, one critical conversationnwith another parent in her community,led to a job offer for Tracy,,and it was an accounting jobnin a finance department.,But it was a temp job.,The company told hernthere was a possibility,it could turn into something more,nbut no guarantees.,This was in the fall of 2011.,Tracy loved this company,nand she loved the people,and the office was lessnthan 10 minutes from her house.,So even though she had a second job offer,at another companynfor a permanent full-time role,,she decided to take her chancesnwith this internship,and hope for the best.,Well, she ended up blowing awaynall of their expectations,,and the company not onlynmade her a permanent offer,at the beginning of 2012,,but they made it even moreninteresting and challenging,,because they knew what Tracy could handle. 
 Fast forward to 2015,,Tracy's been promoted.,They've paid for hernto get her MBA at night.,She's even hired another relaunchernto work for her.,Tracy's temp job was a tryout,,just like an internship,,and it ended up being a winnfor both Tracy and her employer. 
 Now, my goal is to bringnthe reentry internship concept,to more and more employers.,But in the meantime,,if you are returning to worknafter a career break,,don't hesitate to suggest an internshipnor an internship-like arrangement,to an employer that does not havena formal reentry internship program.,Be their first success story,,and you can be the examplenfor more relaunchers to come. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the past few months, I've beenntraveling for weeks at a time,with only one suitcase of clothes.,One day, I was invitednto an important event,,and I wanted to wearnsomething special and new for it.,So I looked through my suitcasenand I couldn't find anything to wear.,I was lucky to be at the technologynconference on that day,,and I had access to 3D printers.,So I quickly designedna skirt on my computer,,and I loaded the file on the printer.,It just printed the pieces overnight.,The next morning,nI just took all the pieces,,assembled them together in my hotel room,,and this is actually the skirtnthat I'm wearing right now. 
 (Applause) 
 So it wasn't the first timenthat I printed clothes.,For my senior collectionnat fashion design school,,I decided to try and 3D printnan entire fashion collection from my home.,The problem was that I barely knewnanything about 3D printing,,and I had only nine months to figure outnhow to print five fashionable looks. 
 I always felt most creativenwhen I worked from home.,I loved experimenting with new materials,,and I always triednto develop new techniques,to make the most unique textilesnfor my fashion projects.,I loved going to old factoriesnand weird stores,in search of leftoversnof strange powders and weird materials,,and then bring them home to experiment on.,As you can probably imagine,,my roommates didn't like that at all. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I decided to move onnto working with big machines,,ones that didn't fit in my living room.,I love the exactnand the custom work I can do,with all kinds of fashion technologies,,like knitting machinesnand laser cutting and silk printing. 
 One summer break, I came herento New York for an internship,at a fashion house in Chinatown.,We worked on two incredible dressesnthat were 3D printed.,They were amazing --nlike you can see here.,But I had a few issues with them.,They were made from hard plasticsnand that's why they were very breakable.,The models couldn't sit in them,,and they even got scratchednfrom the plastics under their arms. 
 With 3D printing, the designersnhad so much freedom,to make the dresses looknexactly like they wanted,,but still, they were very dependentnon big and expensive industrial printers,that were located in a labnfar from their studio. 
 Later that year, a friend gave mena 3D printed necklace,,printed using a home printer.,I knew that these printersnwere much cheaper,and much more accessiblenthan the ones we used at my internship.,So I looked at the necklace,,and then I thought, "If I cannprint a necklace from home,,why not print my clothes from home, too?",I really liked the idea that I wouldn'tnhave to go to the market,and pick fabrics thatnsomeone else chose to sell --,I could just design themnand print them directly from home. 
 I found a small makerspace,,where I learned everythingnI know about 3D printing.,Right away, they literallyngave me the key to the lab,,so I could experimentninto the night, every night. 
 The main challenge was to find the rightnfilament for printing clothes with.,So what is a filament?,Filament is the materialnyou feed the printer with.,And I spent a month or sonexperimenting with PLA,,which is a hard and scratchy,nbreakable material. 
 The breakthrough camenwhen I was introduced to Filaflex,,which is a new kind of filament.,It's strong, yet very flexible.,And with it, I was able to printnthe first garment,,the red jacket that hadnthe word "Liberté" --,"freedom" in French --,embedded into it.,I chose this word because I feltnso empowered and free,when I could just designna garment from my home,and then print it by myself.,And actually, you can easilyndownload this jacket,,and easily change the wordnto something else.,For example, your namenor your sweetheart's name. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the printer plates are small,,so I had to piece the garmentntogether, just like a puzzle. 
 And I wanted to solve another challenge.,I wanted to print textiles,that I would usenjust like regular fabrics.,That's when I found an open-source file,from an architect who designedna pattern that I love.,And with it, I was able to printna beautiful textile,that I would usenjust like a regular fabric.,And it actually even looksna little bit like lace. 
 So I took his file and I modified it,nand changed it, played with it --,many kinds of versions out of it.,And I needed to printnanother 1,500 more hours,to complete printing my collection.,So I brought six printers to my homenand just printed 24-7.,And this is actuallyna really slow process,,but let's remember the Internetnwas significantly slower 20 years ago,,so 3D printing will also accelerate,and in no time you'll be able to printna T-Shirt in your home,in just a couple of hours,nor even minutes. 
 So you guys, you want to seenwhat it looks like? 
 Audience: Yeah! 
 (Applause) 
 Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearingnone of my five outfits.,Almost everything here she's wearing,nI printed from my home.,Even her shoes are printed. 
 Audience: Wow! 
 Audience: Cool! 
 (Applause) 
 Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.,(To audience) Thank you, guys. 
 So I think in the future,nmaterials will evolve,,and they will look and feelnlike fabrics we know today,,like cotton or silk.,Imagine personalized clothesnthat fit exactly to your measurements. 
 Music was once a very physical thing.,You would have to gonto the record shop and buy CDs,,but now you can just download the music --,digital music --,directly to your phone.,Fashion is also a very physical thing.,And I wonder what our world will look like,when our clothes will be digital,njust like this skirt is. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause) 
 [Thank You] 
 (Applause)There are a few thingsnthat all of us need.,We all need air to breathe.,We need clean water to drink.,We need food to eat.nWe need shelter and love.,You know. Love is great, too.,And we all need a safe place to pee. 
 (Laughter) Yeah? 
 As a trans person who doesn't fit neatlyninto the gender binary,,if I could change the world tomorrow,to make it easier for me to navigate,,the very first thing I would do,is blink and create single stall,ngender-neutral bathrooms,in all public places. 
 (Applause),Trans people and trans issues,,they've been getting a lotnof mainstream media attention lately.,And this is a great and necessary thing,,but most of that attentionnhas been focused,on a very few individuals,,most of whom are kinda rich,and pretty famous,,and probably don't have to worry that muchnanymore about where they're going to pee,in between classesnat their community college,,or where they're going to get changedninto their gym strip,at their public high school.,Fame and money insulatesnthese television star trans people,from most of the everyday challenges,that the rest of usnhave to tackle on a daily basis. 
 Public bathrooms.,They've been a problem for mensince as far back as I can remember,,first when I was just a little baby tomboy,and then later as a masculine-appearing,npredominantly estrogen-based organism. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, today as a trans person,npublic bathrooms and change rooms,are where I am most likelynto be questioned or harassed.,I've often been verballynattacked behind their doors.,I've been hauled out by security guardsnwith my pants still halfway pulled up.,I've been stared at,nscreamed at, whispered about,,and one time I got smacked in the facenby a little old lady's purse,that from the looks of the shinernI took home that day,I am pretty certain contained at leastn70 dollars of rolled up small change,and a large hard candy collection. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I know what some of you are thinking,,and you're mostly right.,I can and do just use the men's roomnmost of the time these days.,But that doesn't solvenmy change room dilemmas, does it?,And I shouldn't have to use the men's roomnbecause I'm not a man.,I'm a trans person. 
 And now we've gotnthese fearmongering politicians,that keep trying to passnthese bathroom bills.,Have you heard about these?,They try to legislatento try and force people like myself,to use the bathroomnthat they deem most appropriate,according to the gendernI was assigned at birth.,And if these politiciansnever get their way,,in Arizona or California or Florida,or just last week in Houston, Texas,,or Ottawa,,well then, using the men's roomnwill not be a legal option for me either. 
 And every time one of these politiciansnbrings one of these bills to the table,,I can't help but wonder, you know,,just who will and exactly how would wengo about enforcing laws like these. Right?,Panty checks?,Really.,Genital inspections outsidenof bath change rooms at public pools?,There's no legalnor ethical or plausible way,to enforce laws like these anyway.,They exist only to foster fear,and promote transphobia.,They don't make anyone safer.,But they do for sure make the worldnmore dangerous for some of us. 
 And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.,They drop out of school,nor they opt out of life altogether.,Trans people, especially transnand gender-nonconforming youth,face additional challengesnwhen accessing pools and gyms,,but also universities,,hospitals, libraries.,Don't even get me startednon how they treat us in airports. 
 If we don't move now,to make sure that these places,are truly open and accessible to everyone,,then we just need to get honest,and quit calling them public places.,We need to just admit,that they are really only open for people,who fit neatlyninto one of two gender boxes,,which I do not.,I never have.,And this starts very early. 
 I know a little girl.nShe's the daughter of a friend of mine.,She's a self-identified tomboy.,I'm talking about cowboy boots,and Caterpillar yellow toy trucksnand bug jars, the whole nine yards.,One time I asked hernwhat her favorite color was.,She told me, "Camouflage." 
 (Laughter) 
 So that awesome little kid,,she came home from school last October,from her half day of preschool,with soggy pants on because the other kidsnat school were harassing her,when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.,And the teacher had already instructed hernto stay out of the boys' bathroom.,And she had drank two glassesnof that red juice,at the Halloween party,,and I mean, who can resistnthat red juice, right? It's so good.,And she couldn't hold her pee any longer. 
 Her and her classmatesnwere four years old.,They already felt empowered enough,to police her usenof the so-called public bathrooms.,She was four years old.,She had already been taughtnthe brutal lesson,that there wasnno bathroom door at preschool,with a sign on itnthat welcomed people like her.,She'd already learned that bathroomsnwere going to be a problem,,and that problem started with her,and was hers alone.,So my friend asked mento talk to her little daughter,,and I did.,I wanted to tell her,that me and her momnwere going to march on down,and talk to that school,nand the problem was going to go away,,but I knew that wasn't true.,I wanted to tell her that it was allngoing to get better when she got older,,but I couldn't.,So I asked her to tell menthe story of what had happened,,asked her to tell me how it made her feel.,"Mad and sad,",she told me.,So I told her,that she wasn't alone,and that it wasn't rightnwhat had happened to her,,and then she asked menif I had ever peed in my pants before.,I said yes, I had,,but not for a really long time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which of course was a lie,,because you knownhow you hit, like, 42 or 43,,and sometimes you just,nI don't know, you pee a little bit,when you cough or sneeze,,when you're running upstairs,nor you're stretching.,Don't lie.,It happens. Right?,She doesn't need to know that, I figure. 
 (Laughter) 
 I told her, when you get older,nyour bladder is going to grow bigger, too.,When you get old like me,,you're going to be ablento hold your pee for way longer,,I promised her. 
 "Until you can get home?",she asked me. 
 I said, "Yes,,until you can get home.",She seemed to take some comfort in that. 
 So let's just build some single stall,ngender-neutral bathrooms,with a little bench for getting changedninto your gym clothes.,We can't change the world overnight,for our children,,but we can give themna safe and private place,to escape that world,,if only for just a minute.,This we can do.,So let's just do it. 
 And if you are one of those peoplenwho is sitting out there right now,already coming up with a list of reasonsnin your head why this is not a priority,,or it's too expensive,,or telling yourself that givingna trans person a safe place to pee,or get changed in,supports a lifestyle choicenthat you feel offends your morality,,or your masculinity,,or your religious beliefs,,then let me just appeal,to the part of your heartnthat probably, hopefully,,does care aboutnthe rest of the population.,If you can't bring yourselfnto care enough about people like me,,then what about women and girls,with body image issues?,What about anyonenwith body image stuff going on?,What about that boy at schoolnwho is a foot shorter than his classmates,,whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?,Oh, grade eight,,what a cruel master you can be.,Right?,What about people with anxiety issues?,What about people with disabilitiesnor who need assistance in there?,What about folks with bodiesnwho, for whatever reason,,don't fit into the mainstream ideanof what a body should look like?,How many of us still feel shy,or afraid to disrobenin front of our peers,,and how many of us allow that fear,to keep us from something as important,as physical exercise?,Would all those people not benefit,from these single stall facilities? 
 We can't changentransphobic minds overnight,,but we can give everybody,a place to get changed in,so that we can all get to work,making the world safer,for all of us. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm an underwater explorer,,more specifically a cave diver. 
 I wanted to be an astronautnwhen I was a little kid,,but growing up in Canada as a young girl,nthat wasn't really available to me.,But as it turns out,nwe know a lot more about space,than we do about the underground waterwaysncoursing through our planet,,the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.,So I decided to do somethingnthat was even more remarkable.,Instead of exploring outer space,,I wanted to explorenthe wonders of inner space. 
 Now, a lot of people will tell you,that cave diving is perhapsnone of the most dangerous endeavors.,I mean, imagine yourselfnhere in this room,,if you were suddenlynplunged into blackness,,with your only job to find the exit,,sometimes swimmingnthrough these large spaces,,and at other timesncrawling beneath the seats,,following a thin guideline,,just waiting for the life supportnto provide your very next breath.,Well, that's my workplace. 
 But what I want to teach you today,is that our worldnis not one big solid rock.,It's a whole lot more like a sponge.,I can swim through a lot of the poresnin our earth's sponge,,but where I can't,,other life-forms and other materialsncan make that journey without me.,And my voice is the onenthat's going to teach you,about the inside of Mother Earth. 
 There was no guidebook available to me,when I decided to be the first personnto cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.,In 2000, this was the largestnmoving object on the planet.,It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,,and we went down therento explore ice edge ecology,and search for life-forms beneath the ice. 
 We use a technology called rebreathers.,It's an awful lot like the same technologynthat is used for space walks.,This technology enables us to go deeper,than we could've imaginedneven 10 years ago.,We use exotic gases,,and we can make missionsneven up to 20 hours long underwater. 
 I work with biologists.,It turns out that cavesnare repositories of amazing life-forms,,species that we never knew existed before.,Many of these life-formsnlive in unusual ways.,They have no pigmentnand no eyes in many cases,,and these animalsnare also extremely long-lived.,In fact, animals swimmingnin these caves today,are identical in the fossil record,that predates the extinctionnof the dinosaurs.,So imagine that: these arenlike little swimming dinosaurs.,What can they teach usnabout evolution and survival?,When we look at an animalnlike this remipede swimming in the jar,,he has giant fangs with venom.,He can actually attack somethingn40 times his size and kill it.,If he were the size of a cat,,he'd be the most dangerousnthing on our planet.,And these animals livenin remarkably beautiful places,,and in some cases,ncaves like this, that are very young,,yet the animals are ancient.,How did they get there? 
 I also work with physicists,,and they're interested oftentimesnin global climate change.,They can take rocks within the caves,,and they can slice themnand look at the layers within with rocks,,much like the rings of a tree,,and they can count back in history,and learn about the climate on our planetnat very different times.,The red that you see in this photograph,is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.,So it's been picked up by wind,nblown across the Atlantic Ocean.,It's rained down in this casenon the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.,It soaks in through the ground,and deposits itselfnin the rocks within these caves.,And when we look back in the layersnof these rocks, we can find times,when the climatenwas very, very dry on earth,,and we can go backnmany hundreds of thousands of years. 
 Paleoclimatologists are also interested,in where the sea level stands werenat other times on earth.,Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked,on the deepest manned divesnever conducted in the region,,and we were looking for places,where the sea levelnused to lap up against the shoreline,,many hundreds of feetnbelow current levels. 
 I also get to work with paleontologistsnand archaeologists.,In places like Mexico,nin the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,,we're looking at cultural remainsnand also human remains in caves,,and they tell us a lot,about some of the earliestninhabitants of these regions. 
 But my very favorite project of allnwas over 15 years ago,,when I was a part of the teamnthat made the very first,accurate, three-dimensional mapnof a subterranean surface.,This device that I'mndriving through the cave,was actually creatingna three-dimensional model as we drove it.,We also used ultra low frequency radio,to broadcast back to the surfacenour exact position within the cave.,So I swam under houses and businessesnand bowling alleys and golf courses,,and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant, 
 Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me,was that everything we donon the surface of our earth,will be returned to us to drink.,Our water planet is not justnrivers, lakes and oceans,,but it's this vast network of groundwaternthat knits us all together.,It's a shared resourcenfrom which we all drink.,And when we can understandnour human connections with our groundwater,and all of our water resourcesnon this planet,,then we'll be working on the problem,that's probably the most importantnissue of this century. 
 So I never got to be that astronautnthat I always wanted to be,,but this mapping device,ndesigned by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.,It's actually morphed.,It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,,artificially intelligent,,and its ultimate goalnis to go to Jupiter's moon Europa,and explore oceans beneathnthe frozen surface of that body. 
 And that's pretty amazing. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to you about my kids.,Now, I know everyone thinksnthat their kid is the most fantastic,,the most beautiful kid that ever lived.,But mine really are. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have 696 kids,,and they are the most intelligent,ninventive, innovative,,brilliant and powerful kidsnthat you'll ever meet. 
 Any student I've had the honor of teachingnin my classroom is my kid.,However, because their "real"nparents aren't rich,and, I argue, because theynare mostly of color,,they will seldom get to see in themselves,the awesomeness that I see in them.,Because what I see in them is myself --,or what would have been myself. 
 I am the daughter of two hardworking,,college-educated, African-American parents,who chose careers as public servants:,my father, a minister;nmy mother, an educator.,Wealth was never the primarynambition in our house.,Because of this lack of wealth,,we lived in a neighborhoodnthat lacked wealth,,and henceforth a school systemnthat lacked wealth.,Luckily, however, we strucknthe educational jackpot,in a voluntary desegregation program,that buses inner-city kids --nblack and brown --,out to suburban schools -- rich and white. 
 At five years old, I had to takenan hour-long bus ride,to a faraway place,to get a better education.,At five years old, I thoughtneveryone had a life just like mine.,I thought everyone went to school,and were the only onesnusing the brown crayons,to color in their family portraits,,while everyone else was usingnthe peach-colored ones.,At five years old, I thoughtneveryone was just like me.,But as I got older, I startednnoticing things, like:,How come my neighborhood friendndon't have to wake up,at five o'clock in the morning,,and go to a school that's an hour away?,How come I'm learning to play the violin,while my neighborhood friendsndon't even have a music class?,Why were my neighborhood friendsnlearning and reading material,that I had done two to three years prior? 
 See, as I got older,,I started to haventhis unlawful feeling in my belly,,like I was doing somethingnthat I wasn't supposed to be doing;,taking something that wasn't mine;,receiving a gift,,but with someone else's name on it.,All these amazing thingsnthat I was being exposed to,and experiencing,,I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.,I wasn't supposed to have a library,nfully equipped athletic facilities,,or safe fields to play in.,I wasn't supposed to haventheatre departments,with seasonal plays and concerts --,digital, visual, performing arts.,I wasn't supposed to havenfully resourced biology or chemistry labs,,school buses that brought me door-to-door,,freshly prepared school lunches,or even air conditioning.,These are things my kids don't get. 
 You see, as I got older,,while I was gratefulnfor this amazing opportunity,that I was being given,,there was this ever-present pang of:,But what about everyone else?,There are thousandsnof other kids just like me,,who deserve this, too.,Why doesn't everyone get this?,Why is a high-quality educationnonly exclusive to the rich? 
 It was like I had some sortnof survivor's remorse.,All of my neighborhood friendsnwere experiencing,an educational train wreck,that I was saved from through a bus ride.,I was like an educational Moses screaming,,"Let my people go ...,to high-quality schools!" 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd seen firsthand how the other halfnwas being treated and educated.,I'd seen the educational promised land,,and I could not for the life of menjustify the disparity. 
 I now teach in the very same school systemnfrom which I sought refuge.,I know firsthand the toolsnthat were given to me as a student,,and now as a teacher, I don't havenaccess to those same tools,to give my students.,There have been countless nightsnwhen I've cried in frustration,,anger,and sorrow,,because I can't teach my kidsnthe way that I was taught,,because I don't have accessnto the same resources or tools,that were used to teach me.,My kids deserve so much better. 
 We sit and we keep bangingnour heads against this term:,"Achievement gap, achievement gap!",Is it really that hard to understand,why these kids perform wellnand these kids don't?,I mean, really.,I think we've got it all wrong.,I think we,,as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,,should flip our paradigm and our languagenand call it what it really is.,It's not an achievement gap;,it's an education debt,,for all of the foregone schoolingnresources that were never invested,in the education of the blacknand brown child over time. 
 A little-known secret in American history,is that the only American institutionncreated specifically for people of color,is the American slave trade --,and some would argue the prison system,,but that's another topicnfor another TED Talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 The public school system of this countrynwas built, bought and paid for,using commerce generatednfrom the slave trade and slave labor.,While African-Americans were enslavednand prohibited from schooling,,their labor establishednthe very institution,from which they were excluded.,Ever since then, every court case,neducational policy, reform,,has been an attemptnto retrofit the design,,rather than just stoppingnand acknowledging:,we've had it all wrong from the beginning. 
 An oversimplificationnof American educational history.,All right, just bear with me.,Blacks were kept out -- you know,nthe whole slavery thing.,With the helpnof philanthropic white people,,they built their own schools.,Separate but equal was OK.,But while we all knownthings were indeed separate,,they were in no ways equal.,Enter Brown v. the Board of Educationnof Topeka, Kansas in 1954;,legal separation of the racesnis now illegal.,But very few people pay attentionnto all of the court cases since then,,that have undone the educationalnpromised land for every child,that Brown v. Board intended.,Some argue that today our schoolsnare now more segregated,than they ever were before we triednto desegregate them in the first place. 
 Teaching my kids about desegregation,nthe Little Rock Nine,,the Civil Rights Movement,,is a real awkward moment in my classroom,,when I have to hearnthe voice of a child ask,,"If schools were desegregated in 1954,,how come there are no white kids here?" 
 (Laughter) 
 These kids aren't dumb.,They know exactly what's happening,,and what's not.,They know that when it comes to schooling,,black lives don't matter,and they never have. 
 For years, I tried desperatelynto cultivate in my kids a love of reading.,I'd amassed a modest classroom library,of books I'd accumulatednfrom secondhand shops,,thrift stores, attics -- you know.,But whenever I said those dreadful words,,"Take out a book and read,",you'd think I'd just declared war.,It was torture.,One day,,after I'd heard about this websitencalled DonorsChoose,,where classroom teachers create wish lists,of items they need for their classroom,and anonymous donors fulfill them,,I figured I'd go out on a limbnand just make a wish list,of the teenager's dream library.,Over 200 brand-new booksnwere sent to my room piece by piece.,Every day there were new deliveriesnand my kids would exclaim with glee,,"This feels like Christmas!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Then they'd say,,"Ms. Sumner, where didnthese books come from?" 
 And then I'd reply,,"Strangers from all over the countrynwanted you to have these." 
 And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,,"But they're brand-new." 
 (Laughter) 
 To which I'd reply,,"You deserve brand-new books." 
 The whole experience hit homenfor me when one of my girls,,as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,,"Ms. Sumner -- you know,nI figured you bought these books,,'cause you teachersnare always buying us stuff.,But to know that a stranger,nsomeone I don't even know,,cares this much about me,is pretty cool." 
 Knowing that strangersnwill take care of you,is a privilege my kids aren't afforded. 
 Ever since the donation,,there has been a steady stream of kidsnsigning out books to take home,,and then returning themnwith the exclamation,,"This one was good!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now when I say,n"Take out a book and read,",kids rush to my library.,It wasn't that they didn't want to read,,but instead, they'd gladly readnif the resources were there. 
 Institutionally speaking,,our public school system has neverndone right by the black and brown child.,We keep focusing on the end results,or test results,,and getting frustrated.,We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,,"How did it get so bad?nHow did we get here?",Really?,If you neglect a child long enough,,you no longer haventhe right to be surprised,when things don't turn out well. 
 Stop being perplexed,or confused,or befuddled,by the achievement gap,,the income gap,,the incarceration rates,,or whatever socioeconomic disparitynis the new "it" term for the moment.,The problems we have as a country,are the problems we created as a country.,The quality of your educationnis directly proportionate,to your access to college,,your access to jobs,,your access to the future. 
 Until we live in a world where every kidncan get a high-quality education,no matter where they live,,or the color of their skin,,there are things we can donon a macro level.,School funding should notnbe decided by property taxes,or some funky economic equation,where rich kids continuento benefit from state aid,,while poor kids are continuouslynhaving food and resources,taken from their mouths.,Governors, senators, mayors,ncity council members --,if we're going to callnpublic education public education,,then it should be just that.,Otherwise, we shouldncall it what it really is:,poverty insurance.,"Public education:,keeping poor kids poor since 1954." 
 (Laughter) 
 If we really, as a country, believenthat education is the "great equalizer,",then it should be just that:nequal and equitable.,Until then, there's no democracynin our democratic education. 
 On a mezzo level:,historically speaking, the educationnof the black and brown child,has always dependednon the philanthropy of others.,And unfortunately, today it still does.,If your son or daughter or niecenor nephew or neighbor,or little Timmy down the street,goes to an affluent school,,challenge your school committeento adopt an impoverished school,or an impoverished classroom.,Close the divide by engagingnin communication,and relationships that matter.,When resources are shared,,they're not divided;,they're multiplied. 
 And on a micro level:,if you're a human being,,donate.,Time, money, resources, opportunities --,whatever is in your heart.,There are websites like DonorsChoose,that recognize the disparity,and actually wantnto do something about it. 
 What is a carpenter with no tools?,What is an actress with no stage?,What is a scientist with no laboratory?,What is a doctor with no equipment?,I'll tell you:,they're my kids.,Shouldn't they be your kids, too? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So there are landsnfew and far between on Earth itself,that are hospitable to humansnby any measure,,but survive we have.,Our primitive ancestors, when they foundntheir homes and livelihood endangered,,they dared to make their wayninto unfamiliar territories,in search of better opportunities.,And as the descendants of these explorers,,we have their nomadic bloodncoursing through our own veins.,But at the same time,,distracted by our bread and circuses,and embroiled in the warsnthat we have waged on each other,,it seems that we have forgottennthis desire to explore.,We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely,for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,,and so content are wenwith our living conditions,that we have grown complacentnand just too busy,to notice that its resources are finite,,and that our Sun's life is also finite.,While Mars and all the moviesnmade in its name,have reinvigoratednthe ethos for space travel,,few of us seem to truly realizenthat our species' fragile constitution,is woefully unpreparednfor long duration journeys into space. 
 Let us take a treknto your local national forest,for a quick reality check.,So just a quick show of hands here:,how many of you think you would be ablento survive in this lush wilderness,for a few days?,Well, that's a lot of you.,How about a few weeks?,That's a decent amount.,How about a few months?,That's pretty good too.,Now, let us imaginenthat this local national forest,experiences an eternal winter.,Same questions: how many of you think younwould be able to survive for a few days?,That's quite a lot.,How about a few weeks?,So for a fun twist, let us imaginenthat the only source of water available,is trapped as frozen blocksnmiles below the surface.,Soil nutrients are so minimalnthat no vegetation can be found,,and of course hardly any atmospherenexists to speak of. 
 Such examples are only a fewnof the many challenges we would face,on a planet like Mars.,So how do we steel ourselves for voyagesnwhose destinations are so far removed,from a tropical vacation?,Will we continuously ship suppliesnfrom Planet Earth?,Build space elevators,nor impossible miles of transport belts,that tether your planet of choicento our home planet?,And how do we grow things like foodnthat grew up on Earth like us? 
 But I'm getting ahead of myself.,In our species' journeynto find a new home under a new sun,,we are more likely than notngoing to be spending much time,in the journey itself,,in space,,on a ship, a hermetic flying can,,possibly for many generations. 
 The longest continuous amount of timenthat any human has spent in space,is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.,From astronauts' experiences in space,,we know that spending timenin a microgravity environment,means bone loss, muscle atrophy,ncardiovascular problems,,among many other complications,that range for the physiologicalnto the psychological.,And what about macrogravity,,or any other variationnin gravitational pull,of the planet that we find ourselves on? 
 In short, our cosmic voyagesnwill be fraught with dangers,both known and unknown.,So far we've been looking to thisnnew piece of mechanical technology,or that great next generation robot,as part of a lineup to ensurenour species safe passage in space.,Wonderful as they are,nI believe the time has come,for us to complementnthese bulky electronic giants,with what nature has already invented:,the microbe,,a single-celled organism that is itselfna self-generating, self-replenishing,,living machine.,It requires fairly little to maintain,,offers much flexibility in design,and only asks to be carriednin a single plastic tube. 
 The field of study that has enabled usnto utilize the capabilities of the microbe,is known as synthetic biology.,It comes from molecular biology,nwhich has given us antibiotics, vaccines,and better ways to observenthe physiological nuances,of the human body.,Using the tools of synthetic biology,,we can now edit the genesnof nearly any organism,,microscopic or not,,with incredible speed and fidelity.,Given the limitationsnof our man-made machines,,synthetic biology will be a means for usnto engineer not only our food,,our fuel and our environment,,but also ourselves,to compensatenfor our physical inadequacies,and to ensure our survival in space. 
 To give you an example,of how we can use synthetic biologynfor space exploration,,let us return to the Mars environment.,The Martian soil composition is similarnto that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,,with trace amounts of organic material.,Let's say, hypothetically,,what if martian soilncould actually support plant growth,without using Earth-derived nutrients?,The first questionnwe should probably ask is,,how would we makenour plants cold-tolerant?,Because, on average,nthe temperature on Mars,is a very uninvitingnnegative 60 degrees centigrade.,The next question we should ask is,,how do we makenour plants drought-tolerant?,Considering that most of the waternthat forms as frost,evaporates more quicklynthan I can say the word "evaporate.",Well, it turns outnwe've already done things like this.,By borrowing genesnfor anti-freeze protein from fish,and genes for drought tolerancenfrom other plants like rice,and then stitching themninto the plants that need them,,we now have plants that can toleratenmost droughts and freezes.,They're known on Earth as GMOs,,or genetically modified organisms,,and we rely on them to feednall the mouths of human civilization.,Nature does stuff like this already,,without our help.,We have simply foundnmore precise ways to do it. 
 So why would we want to changenthe genetic makeup of plants for space?,Well, to not do sonwould mean needing to engineer,endless acres of landnon an entirely new planet,by releasing trillions of gallonsnof atmospheric gasses,and then constructingna giant glass dome to contain it all.,It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise,that quickly becomesna high-cost cargo transport mission.,One of the best ways to ensure,that we will have the food suppliesnand the air that we need,is to bring with us organismsnthat have been engineered,to adapt to new and harsh environments.,In essence, using engineered organismsnto help us terraform a planet,both in the short and long term.,These organisms can then alsonbe engineered to make medicine or fuel. 
 So we can use synthetic biologynto bring highly engineered plants with us,,but what else can we do?,Well, I mentioned earliernthat we, as a species,,were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.,That fact has not changed muchnin the last five minutes,that you were sitting herenand I was standing there.,And so, if we were to dumpnany of us on Mars right this minute,,even given ample food, water, air,and a suit,,we are likely to experiencenvery unpleasant health problems,from the amount of ionizing radiationnthat bombards the surface,of planets like Mars that have littlenor nonexistent atmosphere.,Unless we plannto stay holed up underground,for the duration of our staynon every new planet,,we must find better waysnof protecting ourselves,without needing to resortnto wearing a suit of armor,that weighs somethingnequal to your own body weight,,or needing to hide behind a wall of lead. 
 So let us appealnto nature for inspiration.,Among the plethora of life here on Earth,,there's a subset of organismsnknown as extremophiles,,or lovers of extreme living conditions,,if you'll remembernfrom high school biology.,And among these organisms is a bacteriumnby the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.,It is known to be able to withstand cold,ndehydration, vacuum, acid,,and, most notably, radiation.,While its radiationntolerance mechanisms are known,,we have yet to adaptnthe relevant genes to mammals.,To do so is not particularly easy.,There are many facetsnthat go into its radiation tolerance,,and it's not as simplenas transferring one gene.,But given a little bit of human ingenuity,and a little bit of time,,I think to do so is not very hard either.,Even if we borrow just a fractionnof its ability to tolerate radiation,,it would be infinitely betternthan what we already have,,which is just the melanin in our skin.,Using the tools of synthetic biology,,we can harness Deinococcusnradiodurans' ability,to thrive under otherwisenvery lethal doses of radiation.,As difficult as it is to see,,homo sapiens, that is humans,,evolves every day,,and still continues to evolve.,Thousands of years of human evolution,has not only given usnhumans like Tibetans,,who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,,but also Argentinians,nwho can ingest and metabolize arsenic,,the chemical elementnthat can kill the average human being.,Every day, the human body evolvesnby accidental mutations,that equally accidentallynallow certain humans,to persevere in dismal situations. 
 But, and this is a big but,,such evolution requires two thingsnthat we may not always have,,or be able to afford,,and they are death and time.,In our species' strugglento find our place in the universe,,we may not always have the time necessary,for the natural evolutionnof extra functions,for survival on non-Earth planets.,We're living in what E.O. Wilsonnhas termed the age of gene circumvention,,during which we remedy our genetic defectsnlike cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy,with temporary external supplements.,But with every passing day,,we approach the agenof volitional evolution,,a time during which we as a species,will have the capacity to decidenfor ourselves our own genetic destiny.,Augmenting the human bodynwith new abilities,is no longer a question of how,,but of when. 
 Using synthetic biology,to change the genetic makeupnof any living organisms,,especially our own,,is not without its moralnand ethical quandaries.,Will engineering ourselvesnmake us less human?,But then again, what is humanity,but star stuffnthat happens to be conscious?,Where should human genius direct itself?,Surely it is a bit of a wastento sit back and marvel at it.,How do we use our knowledge,to protect ourselvesnfrom the external dangers,and then protect ourselves from ourselves? 
 I pose these questions,not to engender the fear of science,but to bring to lightnthe many possibilities,that science has affordednand continues to afford us.,We must coalesce as humansnto discuss and embrace the solutions,not only with caution,but also with courage. 
 Mars is a destination,,but it will not be our last.,Our true final frontiernis the line we must cross,in deciding what we can and should makenof our species' improbable intelligence. 
 Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.,Our path to the starsnwill be rife with trials,that will bring us to questionnnot only who we are,but where we will be going.,The answers will lie in our choicento use or abandon the technology,that we have gleaned from life itself,,and it will define us for the remaindernof our term in this universe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a textile artist,most widely known for startingnthe yarn bombing movement.,Yarn bombing is when you takenknitted or crocheted material,out into the urban environment,ngraffiti-style --,or, more specifically,,without permission and unsanctioned. 
 But when I started this over 10 years ago,,I didn't have a word for it,,I didn't have anynambitious notions about it,,I had no visions of grandeur.,All I wanted to see was somethingnwarm and fuzzy and human-like,on the cold, steel, gray facadenthat I looked at everyday. 
 So I wrapped the door handle.,I call this the Alpha Piece.,Little did I know that this tiny piecenwould change the course of my life. 
 So clearly the reaction was interesting.,It intrigued me and I thought,n"What else could I do?",Could I do something in the public domainnthat would get the same reaction?,So I wrapped the stop signnpole near my house.,The reaction was wild.,People would park their cars,and get out of their cars and stare at it,,and scratch their heads and stare at it,,and take pictures of itnand take pictures next to it,,and all of that was really exciting to me,and I wanted to do every stop sign polenin the neighborhood.,And the more that I did,nthe stronger the reaction. 
 So at this point I'm smitten.,I'm hooked.,This was all seductive.,I found my new passion,and the urban environmentnwas my playground. 
 So this is some of my early work.,I was very curious about this ideanof enhancing the ordinary,,the mundane, even the ugly,,and not taking away its identitynor its functionality,but just giving it a well-tailorednsuit out of knitting.,And this was fun for me.,It was really funnto take inanimate objects,and have them come to life. 
 So ...,I think we all see the humor in this,,but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I was at a point wherenI wanted to take it seriously.,I wanted to analyze it.,I wanted to know why I was lettingnthis take over my life,,why I was passionate about it,,why were other peoplenreacting so strongly to it.,And I realized something.,We all live in thisnfast-paced, digital world,,but we still crave and desirensomething that's relatable. 
 I think we've all become desensitized,by our overdevelopedncities that we live in,,and billboards and advertisements,,and giant parking lots,,and we don't even complainnabout that stuff anymore.,So when you stumble upon,a stop sign polenthat's wrapped in knitting,and it seems so out of place,and then gradually -- weirdly --,you find a connection to it,,that is the moment.,That is the moment I love,and that is the momentnI love to share with others. 
 So at this point, my curiosity grew.,It went from the fire hydrantsnand the stop sign poles,to what else can I do with this material.,Can I do something bignand large-scale and insurmountable? 
 So that's when the bus happened.,This was a real game changer for me.,I'll always have a soft spotnin my heart for this one. 
 At this point, peoplenwere recognizing my work,but there wasn't much out there,that was wrapped in knittingnthat was large-scale,,and this definitely was the firstncity bus to be wrapped in knitting. 
 So at this point, I'm experiencing,,or I'm witnessing something interesting.,I may have started yarn bombingnbut I certainly don't own it anymore.,It had reached global status.,People from all over the worldnwere doing this.,And I know this because I would travelnto certain parts of the world,that I'd never been to,,and I'd stumble upon a stop sign polenand I knew I didn't wrap it. 
 So as I pursuednmy own goals with my art --,this is a lot of my recent work --,so was yarn bombing.,Yarn bombing was also growing.,And that experience showed menthe hidden power of this craft,and showed me,that there was this common languagenI had with the rest of the world.,It was through this granny hobby --,this unassuming hobby --,that I found commonality with people,that I never thoughtnI'd have a connection with. 
 So as I tell my story today,,I'd also like to convey to you,that hidden power can be foundnin the most unassuming places,,and we all possess skillsnthat are just waiting to be discovered. 
 If you think about our hands,nthese tools that are connected to us,,and what they're capable of doing --,building houses and furniture,,and painting giant murals --,and most of the timenwe hold a controller or a cell phone.,And I'm totally guilty of this as well.,But if you think about it,,what would happennif you put those things down?,What would you make?nWhat would you create with your own hands? 
 A lot of people thinknthat I am a master knitter,but I actually couldn't knitna sweater to save my life.,But I did somethingninteresting with knitting,that had never been done before. 
 I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist,in the sense that I wasn'tnformally trained to do this --,I'm a math major actually.,So I didn't thinknthis was in the cards for me,,but I also know that I didn'tnstumble upon this.,And when this happened to me,nI held on tight,,I fought for it and I'm proud to saynthat I am a working artist today. 
 So as we ponder the future,,know that your futurenmight not be so seamless.,And one day, you mightnbe as bored as I was,and knit a door handlento change your world forever. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So have you ever wonderednwhat it would be like,to live in a place with no rules?,That sounds pretty cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 You wake up one morning, however,,and you discover that the reasonnthere are no rules,is because there's no government,nand there are no laws.,In fact, all social institutionsnhave disappeared.,So there's no schools,,there's no hospitals,,there's no police,,there's no banks,,there's no athletic clubs,,there's no utilities. 
 Well, I know a little bitnabout what this is like,,because when I wasna medical student in 1999,,I worked in a refugee campnin the Balkans during the Kosovo War.,When the war was over,,I got permission -- unbelievably --nfrom my medical school,to take some time off,and follow some of the familiesnthat I had befriended in the camp,back to their village in Kosovo,,and understand how they navigatednlife in this postwar setting. 
 Postwar Kosovonwas a very interesting place,because NATO troops were there,,mostly to make surenthe war didn't break out again.,But other than that,nit was actually a lawless place,,and almost every social institution,nboth public and private,,had been destroyed.,So I can tell you,that when you go into onenof these situations and settings,,it is absolutely thrilling ...,for about 30 minutes,,because that's about how long it takesnbefore you run into a situation,where you realizenhow incredibly vulnerable you are. 
 For me, that moment camenwhen I had to cross the first checkpoint,,and I realized as I drove up,that I would be negotiating passagenthrough this checkpoint,with a heavily armed individual,who, if he decided to shoot menright then and there,,actually wouldn't be doingnanything illegal.,But the sense of vulnerability that I hadnwas absolutely nothing,in comparison to the vulnerabilitynof the families that I got to know,over that year. 
 You see, life in a societynwhere there are no social institutions,is riddled with danger and uncertainty,,and simple questions like,n"What are we going to eat tonight?",are very complicated to answer.,Questions about security,nwhen you don't have any security systems,,are terrifying.,Is that altercation I hadnwith the neighbor down the block,going to turn into a violent episodenthat will end my life,or my family's life? 
 Health concernsnwhen there is no health system,are also terrifying.,I listened as many familiesnhad to sort through questions like,,"My infant has a fever.nWhat am I going to do?","My sister, who is pregnant,nis bleeding. What should I do?,Who should I turn to?","Where are the doctors,nwhere are the nurses?,If I could find one, are they trustworthy?,How will I pay them?nIn what currency will I pay them?","If I need medications,nwhere will I find them?,If I take those medications,nare they actually counterfeits?",And on and on.,So for life in these settings,,the dominant theme,nthe dominant feature of life,,is the incredible vulnerabilitynthat people have to manage,day in and day out,,because of the lack of social systems. 
 And it actually turns out,that this feature of lifenis incredibly difficult to explain,and be understood by peoplenwho are living outside of it.,I discovered this when I left Kosovo.,I came back to Boston,nI became a physician,,I became a global publicnhealth policy researcher.,I joined the Harvard Medical School,and Brigham and Women's HospitalnDivision of Global Health.,And I, as a researcher,,really wanted to get startednon this problem right away.,I was like, "How do we reducenthe crushing vulnerability,of people living in these typesnof fragile settings?,Is there any waynwe can start to think about,how to protect and quickly recover,the institutionsnthat are critical to survival,,like the health system?",And I have to say,nI had amazing colleagues.,But one interesting thing about it was,,this was sort of an unusualnquestion for them.,They were kind of like,n"Oh, if you work in war,,doesn't that meannyou work on refugee camps,,and you work on documentingnmass atrocities?" --,which is, by the way, very,nvery, very important. 
 So it took me a while to explainnwhy I was so passionate about this issue,,until about six years ago.,That's when this landmark study,that looked at and describednthe public health consequences of war,was published.,They came to an incredible,nprovocative conclusion.,These researchers concluded,that the vast majority of deathnand disability from war,happens after the cessation of conflict.,So the most dangerous time to be a personnliving in a conflict-affected state,is after the cessation of hostilities;,it's after the peace deal has been signed.,It's when that political solutionnhas been achieved.,That seems so puzzling,nbut of course it's not,,because war kills peoplenby robbing them of their clinics,,of their hospitals,,of their supply chains.,Their doctors are targeted, are killed;nthey're on the run.,And more invisiblenand yet more deadly is the destruction,of the health governance institutionsnand their finances. 
 So this is really notnsurprising at all to me.,But what is surprisingnand somewhat dismaying,,is how little impact this insight has had,,in terms of how we thinknabout human suffering and war.,Let me give you a couple examples. 
 Last year, you may remember,,Ebola hit the West Africanncountry of Liberia.,There was a lot of reportingnabout this group, Doctors Without Borders,,sounding the alarmnand calling for aid and assistance.,But not a lot of that reportingnanswered the question:,Why is Doctors Without Bordersneven in Liberia?,Doctors Without Bordersnis an amazing organization,,dedicated and designed to providenemergency care in war zones.,Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 --,that was 11 yearsnbefore Ebola even struck.,When Ebola struck Liberia,,there were less than 50 doctorsnin the entire country,of 4.5 million people.,Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia,because Liberia still doesn't really havena functioning health system,,11 years later. 
 When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,,the outpouring of internationalnaid was phenomenal.,But did you know that onlyntwo percent of that funding,went to rebuildnHaitian public institutions,,including its health sector?,From that perspective,,Haitians continue to dienfrom the earthquake even today. 
 I recently met this gentleman.,This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.,He's the Minister of Healthnin the northern autonomous region of Iraq,,in Kurdistan.,Here he is announcingnthat in the last nine months,,his country, his region, has increasednfrom four million people,to five million people.,That's a 25 percent increase.,Thousands of these new arrivalsnhave experienced incredible trauma.,His doctors are workingn16-hour days without pay.,His budget has not increasednby 25 percent;,it has decreased by 20 percent,,as funding has flowed to security concernsnand to short-term relief efforts.,When his health sector fails --,and if history is any guide, it will --,how do you think that's going to influence,the decision makingnof the five million people in his region,as they think aboutnwhether they should flee,that type of vulnerable living situation? 
 So as you can see,nthis is a frustrating topic for me,,and I really try to understand:,Why the reluctance to protect and support,indigenous health systemsnand security systems?,I usually tier two concerns,ntwo arguments.,The first concern is about corruption,,and the concern that peoplenin these settings are corrupt,and they are untrustworthy.,And I will admit that I have metnunsavory characters,working in health sectorsnin these situations.,But I will tell you that the oppositenis absolutely true,in every case I have worked on,,from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo,nto Haiti, to Liberia --,I have met inspiring people,,who, when the chips were downnfor their country,,they risked everythingnto save their health institutions.,The trick for the outsidernwho wants to help,is identifying who those individuals are,,and building a pathway for them to lead. 
 That is exactly what happenednin Afghanistan.,One of the unsung and untoldnsuccess stories,of our nation-building effortnin Afghanistan,involved the World Bank in 2002ninvesting heavily,in identifying, training and promotingnAfghani health sector leaders.,These health sector leadersnhave pulled off an incredible feat,in Afghanistan.,They have aggressively increasednaccess to health care,for the majority of the population.,They are rapidly improvingnthe health status,of the Afghan population,,which used to be the worst in the world.,In fact, the Afghan Ministrynof Health does things,that I wish we would do in America.,They use things like data to make policy.,It's incredible. 
 (Laughter) 
 The other concern I hear a lot about is:,"We just can't afford it,nwe just don't have the money.,It's just unsustainable.",I would submit to younthat the current situation,and the current system we have,is the most expensive, inefficient systemnwe could possibly conceive of.,The current situationnis that when governments like the US --,or, let's say, the collectionnof governments,that make up the European Commission --,every year, they spend 15 billion dollars,on just humanitarian and emergencynand disaster relief worldwide.,That's nothing about foreign aid,nthat's just disaster relief.,Ninety-five percent of itngoes to international relief agencies,,that then have to import resourcesninto these areas,,and knit together some typenof temporary health system, let's say,,which they then dismantle and send awaynwhen they run out of money. 
 So our job, it turns out, is very clear. 
 We, as the global healthncommunity policy experts,,our first job is to become expertsnin how to monitor,the strengths and vulnerabilitiesnof health systems,in threatened situations.,And that's when we see doctors fleeing,,when we see health resources drying up,,when we see institutions crumbling --,that's the emergency.,That's when we need to sound the alarmnand wave our arms.,OK?,Not now.,Everyone can see that's an emergency,nthey don't need us to tell them that. 
 Number two:,places like where I work at Harvardnneed to take their cue,from the World Bank experiencenin Afghanistan,,and we need to -- and we will --,build robust platforms to supportnhealth sector leaders like these.,These people risk their lives.,I think we can match their couragenwith some support. 
 Number three:,we need to reach outnand make new partnerships.,At our global health center,,we have launched a new initiativenwith NATO and other security policy makers,to explore with them what they can donto protect health system institutions,during deployments.,We want them to see,that protecting health systemsnand other critical social institutions,is an integral part of their mission.,It's not just about avoidingncollateral damage;,it's about winning the peace. 
 But the most important partnernwe need to engage is you,,the American public,nand indeed, the world public.,Because unless you understandnthe value of social institutions,,like health systemsnin these fragile settings,,you won't support efforts to save them.,You won't click on that article,that talks about "Hey, all thosendoctors are on the run in country X.,I wonder what that means.,I wonder what that means,for that health system's abilitynto, let's say, detect influenza.","Hmm, it's probably not good."nThat's what I'd tell you. 
 Up on the screen,,I've put up my three favorite Americanninstitution defenders and builders.,Over here is George C. Marshall,,he was the guy that proposednthe Marshall Plan,to save all of Europe's economicninstitutions after World War II.,And this Eleanor Roosevelt.,Her work on human rightsnreally serves as the foundation,for all of our internationalnhuman rights organizations.,Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin,,who did many thingsnin terms of creating institutions,,but was the midwife of our constitution. 
 And I would say to you,that these are folks who, when ourncountry was threatened,,or our world was threatened,,they didn't retreat.,They didn't talk about building walls.,They talked about building institutionsnto protect human security,,for their generation and also for ours.,And I think our generationnshould do the same. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello.,My name is Matthew Williams,,and I am a champion.,I have won medalsnin three different sports,and national games in Canada,,competed at the internationalnlevel in basketball,and was proud to represent Canada,on the world stage. 
 (Applause) 
 I train five days a weeknfor basketball and speed skating,,work with top quality coaches,and mental performance consultants,to be at my best in my sport.,By the way, all thatnis through Special Olympics.,Does that change the way you think of me,and my accomplishments? 
 The world does not seenall people like me as champions.,Not long ago, people like menwere shunned and hidden away.,There has been lots of changensince Special Olympics began in 1968,,but in too many cases,,people with intellectual disabilities,are invisible to the wider population.,People use the r-word in front of me,nand they think it doesn't matter.,That's the word "retard" or "retarded",used in a derogatory manner.,They're not thinking about how muchnit hurts me and my friends. 
 I don't want you to thinknI'm here because I'm a charity case.,I am here because there is stillna big problem with the way,many people see individualsnwith intellectual disabilities,,or, too often,,how they don't see them at all. 
 Did you know the World Gamesnhappened this year?,I was one of over 6,500 athletesnwith intellectual disabilities,from 165 countries who competed in LA.,There was over 62,000 spectatorsnwatching opening ceremonies,,and there was live coveragenon TSN and ESPN.,Did you even know that happened? 
 What do you think ofnwhen you see someone like me?,I am here today to challenge you,to look at us as equals. 
 Special Olympics transformsnthe self-identity of athletes,with intellectual disabilities,and the perceptions of everyone watching.,For those of you who aren't familiar,,Special Olympics is for athletesnwith intellectual disabilities.,Special Olympics is separatenfrom the Paralympics and Olympics.,We offer high-quality,nyear round sports programs,for people with intellectual disabilities,that changes lives and perceptions.,This movement has changed my life,and those of so many others.,And it has changed the way,the world sees peoplenwith intellectual disabilities. 
 I was born with epilepsynand an intellectual disability.,Growing up, I played hockeynuntil I was 12 years old.,The older I got, the more I felt,it was harder to keep upnwith everyone else,,and I was angry and frustrated.,For a while, I did not play any sports,,didn't have many friends,and felt left out and sad. 
 There was a time when peoplenwith intellectual disabilities,were hidden away from society.,No one thought they couldnparticipate in sports,,let alone be a valued member of society.,In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,,a scientist at the University of Toronto,,was studying the effectsnof regular exercise,on the fitness levels of childrennwith intellectual disabilities.,Using rigorous scientific research,,Dr. Hayden and other researchers,came to the conclusion,that it was simply the lacknof opportunity to participate,that caused their fitnessnlevels to suffer. 
 Lots of people doubtednthat people with intellectual disabilities,could benefit from fitness programs,and sports competition opportunities.,But pioneers like Dr. Haydennand Eunice Kennedy Shriver,,the founder of Special Olympics,,persevered,,and Special Olympics athletesnhave proved them right,four and a half million times over. 
 (Applause) 
 Before I joined Special Olympics,,I was nervous,because I was young, shy, not confident,and didn't have many friends.,When I got there, though,neveryone was very encouraging,,supportive, and let me be myself,without being judged.,Now, I am a basketball playernand speed skater,who has competednat provincial, national games,,and this year made it all the waynto the World Summer Games in LA,,where I was part of the first evernCanadian basketball team,to compete at World Games. 
 (Applause) 
 I am one of more than four and a halfnmillion athletes around the globe,,and I've heard so many similar stories.,Being Special Olympics athletes,restores our pride and dignity. 
 Special Olympics also addressesncritical health needs.,Studies have shown that, on average,,men with intellectual disabilities,die 13 years younger than men without,,and women with intellectual disabilities,die 20 years younger than women without.,Special Olympics keeps us healthy,by getting us active,and participating in sport.,Also, our coaches teach usnabout nutrition and health.,Special Olympics also providesnfree health screening,for athletes who have difficultyncommunicating with their doctor,or accessing health care. 
 At the 2015 World Summer Games,,my Team Canada teammates and Inplayed the Nigerian basketball team.,The day before our game,,the Nigerian basketball team went tonthe World Games Healthy Athlete screening,,where seven of 10 members,were given hearing aids for free,and got to hear clearlynfor the first time. 
 (Applause) 
 The change in them was amazing.,They were more excited,nhappy and confident,,because their coach couldnvocally communicate with them.,And they were emotional,because they could hearnthe sounds of the basketball,,the sounds of the whistle,and the cheering fans in the stands --,sounds that we take for granted.,Special Olympics is transforming morenthan just the athlete in their sport.,Special Olympics is transformingntheir lives off the field.,This year, research findings showed,that nearly half of the adults in the US,don't know a single personnwith an intellectual disability,,and the 44 percent of Americans,who don't have personal contactnwith intellectual disabilities,are significantlynless accepting and positive. 
 Then there's the r-word,,proving that peoplenwith intellectual disabilities,are still invisible,to far too many people.,People use it as a casualnterm or an insult.,It was tweeted more thannnine million times last year,,and it is deeply hurtful,to me and my four and a half millionnfellow athletes around the planet.,People don't think it's insulting,,but it is.,As my fellow athlete and global messengernJohn Franklin Stephens wrote,in an open letter to a political pundit,who used the r-word as an insult,,"Come join us someday at Special Olympics.,See if you walk awaynwith your heart unchanged." 
 (Applause) 
 This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,,people lined up for hours,to get into the final nightnof powerlifting competition.,So it was standing room onlynwhen my teammate Jackie Barrett,,the Newfoundland Moose,,deadlifted 655 pounds,and lifted 611 pounds in the squat -- 
 (Applause) 
 setting huge new recordsnfor Special Olympics.,Jackie is a record holdernamong all powerlifters in Newfoundland --,not just Special Olympics,nall powerlifters.,Jackie was a huge star in LA,,and ESPN live-tweetednhis record-breaking lifts,and were wowed by his performance. 
 Fifty years ago, few imaginednindividuals with intellectual disabilities,could do anything like that.,This year, 60,000 spectators fillednthe famous LA Memorial Coliseum,to watch the openingnceremonies of World Games,and cheer athletes from 165 countries,around the world.,Far from being hidden away,,we were cheered and celebrated.,Special Olympics teaches athletes,to be confident and proud of themselves.,Special Olympics teaches the world,that people with intellectual disabilities,deserve respect and inclusion. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I have dreamsnand achievements in my sport,,great coaches,,respect and dignity,,better health,,and I am pursuing a careernas a personal trainer. 
 (Applause) 
 I am no longer hidden, bullied,and I am here doing a TED Talk. 
 (Applause) 
 The world is a different placenbecause of Special Olympics,,but there is still farther to go.,So the next time you see someonenwith an intellectual disability,,I hope you will see their ability.,The next time someone usesnthe r-word near you,,I hope you will tell themnhow much it hurts.,I hope you will think about gettingninvolved with Special Olympics. 
 (Applause) 
 I would like to leave younwith one final thought.,Nelson Mandela said,,"Sports has the powernto change the world.",Special Olympics is changing the world,by transformingnfour and a half million athletes,and giving us a place to be confident,,meet friends,,not be judged,and get to feel like and be champions. 
 Thank you very much.

 EC: Right, right. 
 NP: Where it came from.,So why don't you giventhem a little history --,just a tickle -- a bit of historynof where it comes from. 
 EC: Beatbox started here in New York.

 That's right, that's right.nNew York, New York!,Everybody like, "Yeah!",Well, we from St. Louis. 
 (Laughter) 
 NP: Now you can put y'all hands down. 
 (Laughter) 
 EC: But beatbox started here in New York.,What you would have is that,nwhen we would go to parties,,you would have the DJnand you would have the rapper.,But because I don't havenelectricity coming out of me,,we had to emulatenwhat the beats was doing.,So when you would see the beatboxer,,you would see us over to the side.,Then you would see a rapper,nand when the rapper began to rap,,we would do a simple beat,,because back then the beats were simple -- 
 (Beatboxing) 
 or -- 
 (Beatboxing) 
 Those were simple beats.,But now, you got folks that wantnto do all type of stuff,with their beats now,,and they want to humiliate their father,,which is not right when you wantnto humiliate the person,that take care of you, paynall your tuition, (Nicole laughs),especially when you have 50 million people,that just go aroundnand call you "the loser.",Well, I'm taking that to heart.,But now we do somethingndifferent in our house,,so we have these jam sessions,,and our jam sessions consistnof us jamming in church.,You know, in church,nwe'll look at each other like, 
 (Beatboxing) 
 (Laughter) 
 and we'll text the beat to each other.,Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking,,road trips, airports. 
 NP: Standing right there in the corner,n"Aw, Dad -- listen to that." 
 (Beatboxing) 
 Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what?,We're talking all about thisnjam session and everything. 
 EC: Yeah.

 Thank you! Make some noise! 
 EG: Thank you, everybody! 
 NP: Make some noise! Make some noise! 
 Thank you!Can I get a show of hands --,how many of you in this roomnhave been on a plane in this past year?,That's pretty good.,Well, it turns out that younshare that experience,with more than three billionnpeople every year.,And when we put so many peoplenin all these metal tubes,that fly all over the world,,sometimes, things like this can happen,and you get a disease epidemic. 
 I first actually got into this topic,when I heard about the Ebolanoutbreak last year.,And it turns out that,,although Ebola spreadsnthrough these more range-limited,,large-droplet routes,,there's all these other sorts of diseases,that can be spread in the airplane cabin.,The worst part is, when we takena look at some of the numbers,,it's pretty scary.,So with H1N1,,there was this guy that decidednto go on the plane,and in the matter of a single flight,actually spread the diseasento 17 other people.,And then there was thisnother guy with SARS,,who managed to go on a three-hour flight,and spread the disease to 22 other people.,That's not exactly my ideanof a great superpower. 
 When we take a look at this,nwhat we also find,is that it's very difficultnto pre-screen for these diseases.,So when someone actuallyngoes on a plane,,they could be sick,and they could actuallynbe in this latency period,in which they could actuallynhave the disease,but not exhibit any symptoms,,and they could, in turn,nspread the disease,to many other people in the cabin. 
 How that actually works is that right now,we've got air coming innfrom the top of the cabin,and from the side of the cabin,nas you see in blue.,And then also, that air goes outnthrough these very efficient filters,that eliminate 99.97 percentnof pathogens near the outlets.,What happens right now, though,,is that we have thisnmixing airflow pattern.,So if someone were to actually sneeze,,that air would get swirlednaround multiple times,before it even has a chancento go out through the filter.,So I thought: clearly, thisnis a pretty serious problem. 
 I didn't have the moneynto go out and buy a plane,,so I decided to build a computer instead.,It actually turns out thatnwith computational fluid dynamics,,what we're able to donis create these simulations,that give us higher resolutions,than actually physically goingnin and taking readings in the plane.,And so how, essentially, this worksnis you would start out,with these 2D drawings --,these are floating aroundnin technical papers around the Internet.,I take that and then I put itninto this 3D-modeling software,,really building that 3D model.,And then I divide that modelnthat I just built into these tiny pieces,,essentially meshing it so thatnthe computer can better understand it.,And then I tell the computer wherenthe air goes in and out of the cabin,,throw in a bunch of physics,and basically sit there and wait untilnthe computer calculates the simulation. 
 So what we get, actually,nwith the conventional cabin is this:,you'll notice the middle person sneezing,,and we go "Splat!" -- it goesnright into people's faces.,It's pretty disgusting.,From the front, you'll noticenthose two passengers,sitting next to the central passenger,not exactly having a great time.,And when we take a looknat that from the side,,you'll also notice those pathogensnspreading across the length of the cabin. 
 The first thing I thought was,n"This is no good.",So I actually conductednmore than 32 different simulations,and ultimately, I came upnwith this solution right here.,This is what I call a -- patent pending --nGlobal Inlet Director.,With this, we're able to reducenpathogen transmission,by about 55 times,,and increase fresh-air inhalationnby about 190 percent. 
 So how this actually works,is we would install this piecenof composite material,into these existing spotsnthat are already in the plane.,So it's very cost-effective to install,and we can do this directly overnight.,All we have to do is put a couplenof screws in there and you're good to go.,And the results that we getnare absolutely amazing.,Instead of having those problematicnswirling airflow patterns,,we can create these walls of air,that come down in-between the passengers,to create personalized breathing zones. 
 So you'll notice the middle passengernhere is sneezing again,,but this time, we're ablento effectively push that down,to the filters for elimination.,And same thing from the side,,you'll notice we're able to directlynpush those pathogens down.,So if you take a look again nownat the same scenario,but with this innovation installed,,you'll notice the middlenpassenger sneezes,,and this time, we're pushingnthat straight down into the outlet,before it gets a chancento infect any other people.,So you'll notice the two passengersnsitting next to the middle guy,are breathing virtuallynno pathogens at all.,Take a look at that from the side as well,,you see a very efficient system. 
 And in short, with this system, we win.,When we take a look at what this means,,what we see is that this not only worksnif the middle passenger sneezes,,but also if the window-seatnpassenger sneezes,or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes. 
 And so with this solution, what doesnthis mean for the world?,Well, when we take a look at this,from the computer simulationninto real life,,we can see with this 3D modelnthat I built over here,,essentially using 3D printing,,we can see those samenairflow patterns coming down,,right to the passengers.,In the past, the SARS epidemicnactually cost the world,about 40 billion dollars.,And in the future,,a big disease outbreakncould actually cost the world,in excess of three trillion dollars.,So before, it used to be that you hadnto take an airplane out of service,for one to two months,,spend tens of thousands of man hoursnand several million dollars,to try to change something.,But now, we're able to installnsomething essentially overnight,and see results right away. 
 So it's really now a matter of takingnthis through to certification,,flight testing,,and going through all of thesenregulatory approvals processes.,But it just really goes to shownthat sometimes the best solutions,are the simplest solutions.,And two years ago, even,,this project would not have happened,,just because the technology thennwouldn't have supported it.,But now with advanced computing,and how developed our Internet is,,it's really the golden era for innovation. 
 And so the question I ask allnof you today is: why wait?,Together, we can build the future today. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)What keeps us healthy and happy,as we go through life?,If you were going to invest now,in your future best self,,where would you put your timenand your energy?,There was a recent survey of millennials,asking them what theirnmost important life goals were,,and over 80 percent said,that a major life goal for themnwas to get rich.,And another 50 percentnof those same young adults,said that another major life goal,was to become famous. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we're constantly toldnto lean in to work, to push harder,and achieve more.,We're given the impression that thesenare the things that we need to go after,in order to have a good life.,Pictures of entire lives,,of the choices that people makenand how those choices work out for them,,those picturesnare almost impossible to get.,Most of what we know about human life,we know from asking peoplento remember the past,,and as we know, hindsightnis anything but 20/20.,We forget vast amountsnof what happens to us in life,,and sometimes memorynis downright creative. 
 But what if we could watch entire lives,as they unfold through time?,What if we could study peoplenfrom the time that they were teenagers,all the way into old age,to see what really keeps peoplenhappy and healthy? 
 We did that.,The Harvard Study of Adult Development,may be the longest studynof adult life that's ever been done.,For 75 years, we've trackednthe lives of 724 men,,year after year, asking about their work,ntheir home lives, their health,,and of course asking all along the waynwithout knowing how their life stories,were going to turn out. 
 Studies like this are exceedingly rare.,Almost all projects of this kindnfall apart within a decade,because too many peoplendrop out of the study,,or funding for the research dries up,,or the researchers get distracted,,or they die, and nobody moves the ballnfurther down the field.,But through a combination of luck,and the persistencenof several generations of researchers,,this study has survived.,About 60 of our original 724 men,are still alive,,still participating in the study,,most of them in their 90s.,And we are now beginning to study,the more than 2,000 children of these men.,And I'm the fourth director of the study. 
 Since 1938, we've tracked the livesnof two groups of men.,The first group started in the study,when they were sophomoresnat Harvard College.,They all finished collegenduring World War II,,and then most went offnto serve in the war.,And the second group that we've followed,was a group of boysnfrom Boston's poorest neighborhoods,,boys who were chosen for the study,specifically because they werenfrom some of the most troubled,and disadvantaged families,in the Boston of the 1930s.,Most lived in tenements,nmany without hot and cold running water. 
 When they entered the study,,all of these teenagers were interviewed.,They were given medical exams.,We went to their homesnand we interviewed their parents.,And then these teenagersngrew up into adults,who entered all walks of life.,They became factory workers and lawyersnand bricklayers and doctors,,one President of the United States.,Some developed alcoholism.nA few developed schizophrenia.,Some climbed the social ladder,from the bottomnall the way to the very top,,and some made that journeynin the opposite direction. 
 The founders of this study,would never in their wildest dreams,have imagined that I would benstanding here today, 75 years later,,telling you thatnthe study still continues.,Every two years, our patientnand dedicated research staff,calls up our mennand asks them if we can send them,yet one more set of questionsnabout their lives. 
 Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,,"Why do you keep wanting to study me?nMy life just isn't that interesting.",The Harvard men never ask that question. 
 (Laughter) 
 To get the clearest picturenof these lives,,we don't just send them questionnaires.,We interview them in their living rooms.,We get their medical recordsnfrom their doctors.,We draw their blood, we scan their brains,,we talk to their children.,We videotape them talking with their wivesnabout their deepest concerns.,And when, about a decade ago,nwe finally asked the wives,if they would join usnas members of the study,,many of the women said,n"You know, it's about time." 
 (Laughter) 
 So what have we learned?,What are the lessons that comenfrom the tens of thousands of pages,of information that we've generated,on these lives?,Well, the lessons aren't about wealthnor fame or working harder and harder.,The clearest message that we getnfrom this 75-year study is this:,Good relationships keep usnhappier and healthier. Period. 
 We've learned three big lessonsnabout relationships.,The first is that social connectionsnare really good for us,,and that loneliness kills.,It turns out that peoplenwho are more socially connected,to family, to friends, to community,,are happier, they're physically healthier,nand they live longer,than people who are less well connected.,And the experience of lonelinessnturns out to be toxic.,People who are more isolatednthan they want to be from others,find that they are less happy,,their health declines earlier in midlife,,their brain functioning declines sooner,and they live shorter livesnthan people who are not lonely.,And the sad factnis that at any given time,,more than one in five Americansnwill report that they're lonely. 
 And we know that youncan be lonely in a crowd,and you can be lonely in a marriage,,so the second big lesson that we learned,is that it's not justnthe number of friends you have,,and it's not whether or notnyou're in a committed relationship,,but it's the qualitynof your close relationships that matters.,It turns out that living in the midstnof conflict is really bad for our health.,High-conflict marriages, for example,nwithout much affection,,turn out to be very bad for our health,nperhaps worse than getting divorced.,And living in the midst of good,nwarm relationships is protective. 
 Once we had followed our mennall the way into their 80s,,we wanted to look back at them at midlife,and to see if we could predict,who was going to growninto a happy, healthy octogenarian,and who wasn't.,And when we gathered togetherneverything we knew about them,at age 50,,it wasn't their middle agencholesterol levels,that predicted how theynwere going to grow old.,It was how satisfied they werenin their relationships.,The people who were the most satisfiednin their relationships at age 50,were the healthiest at age 80.,And good, close relationshipsnseem to buffer us,from some of the slings and arrowsnof getting old.,Our most happily partnered men and women,reported, in their 80s,,that on the daysnwhen they had more physical pain,,their mood stayed just as happy.,But the people who werenin unhappy relationships,,on the days when theynreported more physical pain,,it was magnified by more emotional pain. 
 And the third big lesson that we learnednabout relationships and our health,is that good relationshipsndon't just protect our bodies,,they protect our brains.,It turns out that beingnin a securely attached relationship,to another person in your 80snis protective,,that the people who are in relationships,where they really feel they can countnon the other person in times of need,,those people's memoriesnstay sharper longer.,And the people in relationships,where they feel they reallyncan't count on the other one,,those are the people who experiencenearlier memory decline.,And those good relationships,nthey don't have to be smooth all the time.,Some of our octogenarian couplesncould bicker with each other,day in and day out,,but as long as they felt that theyncould really count on the other,when the going got tough,,those arguments didn't take a tollnon their memories. 
 So this message,,that good, close relationshipsnare good for our health and well-being,,this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.,Why is this so hard to getnand so easy to ignore?,Well, we're human.,What we'd really like is a quick fix,,something we can get,that'll make our lives goodnand keep them that way.,Relationships are messynand they're complicated,and the hard work of tendingnto family and friends,,it's not sexy or glamorous.,It's also lifelong. It never ends.,The people in our 75-year studynwho were the happiest in retirement,were the people who had actively workednto replace workmates with new playmates.,Just like the millennialsnin that recent survey,,many of our men when theynwere starting out as young adults,really believed that fame and wealthnand high achievement,were what they needed to go afternto have a good life.,But over and over, over these 75 years,nour study has shown,that the people who fared the best werenthe people who leaned in to relationships,,with family, with friends, with community. 
 So what about you?,Let's say you're 25,nor you're 40, or you're 60.,What might leaning innto relationships even look like? 
 Well, the possibilitiesnare practically endless.,It might be something as simplenas replacing screen time with people time,or livening up a stale relationshipnby doing something new together,,long walks or date nights,,or reaching out to that family membernwho you haven't spoken to in years,,because those all-too-common family feuds,take a terrible toll,on the people who hold the grudges. 
 I'd like to close with a quotenfrom Mark Twain.,More than a century ago,,he was looking back on his life,,and he wrote this:,"There isn't time, so brief is life,,for bickerings, apologies,nheartburnings, callings to account.,There is only time for loving,,and but an instant,nso to speak, for that." 
 The good life is builtnwith good relationships. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)OK, so today I want to talknabout how we talk about love.,And specifically,,I want to talk about what's wrongnwith how we talk about love. 
 Most of us will probablynfall in love a few times,over the course of our lives,,and in the English language,nthis metaphor, falling,,is really the main way that wentalk about that experience.,I don't know about you,,but when I conceptualize this metaphor,,what I picture is straightnout of a cartoon --,like there's a man,,he's walking down the sidewalk,,without realizing it, he crossesnover an open manhole,,and he just plummets into the sewer below.,And I picture it this waynbecause falling is not jumping.,Falling is accidental,,it's uncontrollable.,It's something that happens to usnwithout our consent.,And this --,this is the main way we talknabout starting a new relationship. 
 I am a writer and I'm alsonan English teacher,,which means I thinknabout words for a living.,You could say that I get paidnto argue that the language we use matters,,and I would like to arguenthat many of the metaphors we use,to talk about love --,maybe even most of them --,are a problem. 
 So, in love, we fall.,We're struck.,We are crushed.,We swoon.,We burn with passion.,Love makes us crazy,,and it makes us sick.,Our hearts ache,,and then they break.,So our metaphors equatenthe experience of loving someone,to extreme violence or illness. 
 (Laughter) 
 They do.,And they position us as the victims,of unforeseen and totallynunavoidable circumstances.,My favorite one of these is "smitten,",which is the past participlenof the word "smite.",And if you look this word upnin the dictionary -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you will see that it can be definednas both "grievous affliction,",and, "to be very much in love.",I tend to associate the word "smite"nwith a very particular context,,which is the Old Testament.,In the Book of Exodus alone,nthere are 16 references to smiting,,which is the word that the Bible usesnfor the vengeance of an angry God. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here we are using the same wordnto talk about love,that we use to explainna plague of locusts. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? 
 So, how did this happen?,How have we come to associate lovenwith great pain and suffering?,And why do we talk aboutnthis ostensibly good experience,as if we are victims?,These are difficult questions,,but I have some theories.,And to think this through,,I want to focus on onenmetaphor in particular,,which is the idea of love as madness. 
 When I first startednresearching romantic love,,I found these madnessnmetaphors everywhere.,The history of Western culture,is full of language that equatesnlove to mental illness.,These are just a few examples.,William Shakespeare:,"Love is merely a madness,",from "As You Like It.",Friedrich Nietzsche:,"There is always some madness in love.","Got me looking, got me lookingnso crazy in love -- " 
 (Laughter) 
 from the great philosopher,nBeyoncé Knowles. 
 (Laughter) 
 I fell in love for the firstntime when I was 20,,and it was a pretty turbulentnrelationship right from the start.,And it was long distancenfor the first couple of years,,so for me that meant very high highsnand very low lows.,I can remember one moment in particular.,I was sitting on a bednin a hostel in South America,,and I was watching the personnI love walk out the door.,And it was late,,it was nearly midnight,,we'd gotten into an argument over dinner,,and when we got back to our room,,he threw his things in the bagnand stormed out.,While I can no longer remembernwhat that argument was about,,I very clearly remembernhow I felt watching him leave. 
 I was 22, it was my first timenin the developing world,,and I was totally alone.,I had another week until my flight home,,and I knew the namenof the town that I was in,,and the name of the citynthat I needed to get to to fly out,,but I had no idea how to get around.,I had no guidebook and very little money,,and I spoke no Spanish. 
 Someone more adventurous than me,might have seen this asna moment of opportunity,,but I just froze.,I just sat there.,And then I burst into tears.,But despite my panic,,some small voice in my head thought,,"Wow. That was dramatic.,I must really be doingnthis love thing right." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because some part of menwanted to feel miserable in love.,And it sounds so strangento me now, but at 22,,I longed to have dramatic experiences,,and in that moment, I was irrationalnand furious and devastated,,and weirdly enough,,I thought that this somehownlegitimized the feelings I had,for the guy who had just left me. 
 I think on some level I wantednto feel a little bit crazy,,because I thought thatnthat was how loved worked.,This really should not be surprising,,considering that according to Wikipedia,,there are eight films,,14 songs,,two albums and one novelnwith the title "Crazy Love." 
 About half an hour later,nhe came back to our room.,We made up.,We spent another mostlynhappy week traveling together.,And then, when I got home,,I thought, "That was sonterrible and so great.,This must be a real romance.",I expected my first lovento feel like madness,,and of course, it metnthat expectation very well.,But loving someone like that --,as if my entire well-being dependednon him loving me back --,was not very good for me,or for him. 
 But I suspect this experience of lovenis not that unusual.,Most of us do feel a bit madnin the early stages of romantic love.,In fact, there is research to confirmnthat this is somewhat normal,,because, neurochemically speaking,,romantic love and mental illnessnare not that easily distinguished.,This is true. 
 This study from 1999 used blood tests,to confirm that the serotoninnlevels of the newly in love,very closely resemblednthe serotonin levels,of people who had been diagnosednwith obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, and low levels of serotonin,are also associatednwith seasonal affective disorder,and depression.,So there is some evidence,that love is associated with changesnto our moods and our behaviors.,And there are other studies to confirm,that most relationships begin this way. 
 Researchers believenthat the low levels of serotonin,is correlated with obsessive thinkingnabout the object of love,,which is like this feeling that someonenhas set up camp in your brain.,And most of us feel this waynwhen we first fall in love.,But the good news is,nit doesn't always last that long --,usually from a few monthsnto a couple of years. 
 When I got back from my tripnto South America,,I spent a lot of time alone in my room,,checking my email,,desperate to hear from the guy I loved.,I decided that if my friends could notnunderstand my grievous affliction,,then I did not need their friendship.,So I stopped hanging outnwith most of them.,And it was probably the mostnunhappy year of my life.,But I think I felt likenit was my job to be miserable,,because if I could be miserable,,then I would prove how much I loved him.,And if I could prove it,,then we would have to end upntogether eventually. 
 This is the real madness,,because there is no cosmic rule,that says that great sufferingnequals great reward,,but we talk about love as if this is true. 
 Our experiences of lovenare both biological and cultural.,Our biology tells us that love is good,by activating these rewardncircuits in our brain,,and it tells us that love is painfulnwhen, after a fight or a breakup,,that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.,And in fact -- and maybenyou've heard this --,neurochemically speaking,,going through a breakup is a lotnlike going through cocaine withdrawal,,which I find reassuring. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then our culture uses language,to shape and reinforcenthese ideas about love.,In this case, we're talkingnabout metaphors about pain,and addiction and madness.,It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.,Love is powerful and at times painful,,and we express thisnin our words and stories,,but then our words and stories prime us,to expect love to be powerful and painful. 
 What's interesting to menis that all of this happens,in a culture that valuesnlifelong monogamy.,It seems like we want it both ways:,we want love to feel like madness,,and we want it to last an entire lifetime.,That sounds terrible. 
 (Laughter) 
 To reconcile this,,we need to either change our culturenor change our expectations.,So, imagine if we were allnless passive in love.,If we were more assertive,nmore open-minded, more generous,and instead of falling in love,,we stepped into love.,I know that this is asking a lot,,but I'm not actuallynthe first person to suggest this.,In their book, "Metaphors We Live By,",linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoffnsuggest a really interesting solution,to this dilemma,,which is to change our metaphors.,They argue that metaphors really do shapenthe way we experience the world,,and that they can even actnas a guide for future actions,,like self-fulfilling prophecies. 
 Johnson and Lakoff suggestna new metaphor for love:,love as a collaborative work of art.,I really like this waynof thinking about love.,Linguists talk about metaphorsnas having entailments,,which is essentially a way of consideringnall the implications of,,or ideas containednwithin, a given metaphor.,And Johnson and Lakoffntalk about everything,that collaboratingnon a work of art entails:,effort, compromise,npatience, shared goals.,These ideas align nicelynwith our cultural investment,in long-term romantic commitment,,but they also work wellnfor other kinds of relationships --,short-term, casual, polyamorous,nnon-monogamous, asexual --,because this metaphor bringsnmuch more complex ideas,to the experience of loving someone. 
 So if love is a collaborative work of art,,then love is an aesthetic experience.,Love is unpredictable,,love is creative,,love requires communicationnand discipline,,it is frustratingnand emotionally demanding.,And love involves both joy and pain.,Ultimately, each experiencenof love is different. 
 When I was younger,,it never occurred to me that I was allowednto demand more from love,,that I didn't have to just acceptnwhatever love offered.,When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --,or, when 14-year-old Julietncannot be with Romeo,,whom she has met four days ago,,she does not feel disappointed or angsty.,Where is she?,She wants to die.,Right?,And just as a refresher,nat this point in the play,,act three of five,,Romeo is not dead.,He's alive,,he's healthy,,he's just been banished from the city.,I understand that 16th-century Veronanis unlike contemporary North America,,and yet when I first read this play,,also at age 14,,Juliet's suffering made sense to me. 
 Reframing love as somethingnI get to create with someone I admire,,rather than somethingnthat just happens to me,without my control or consent,,is empowering.,It's still hard.,Love still feels totally maddeningnand crushing some days,,and when I feel really frustrated,,I have to remind myself:,my job in this relationshipnis to talk to my partner,about what I want to make together.,This isn't easy, either.,But it's just so much betternthan the alternative,,which is that thingnthat feels like madness. 
 This version of love is not about winningnor losing someone's affection.,Instead, it requiresnthat you trust your partner,and talk about thingsnwhen trusting feels difficult,,which sounds so simple,,but is actually a kindnof revolutionary, radical act.,This is because you get to stopnthinking about yourself,and what you're gainingnor losing in your relationship,,and you get to start thinkingnabout what you have to offer.,This version of lovenallows us to say things like,,"Hey, we're not very good collaborators.nMaybe this isn't for us.",Or, "That relationshipnwas shorter than I had planned,,but it was still kind of beautiful." 
 The beautiful thingnabout the collaborative work of art,is that it will not paintnor draw or sculpt itself.,This version of love allows usnto decide what it looks like. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)15 years ago, I volunteerednto participate in a research study,that involved a genetic test.,When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,,I was handed a questionnaire.,One of the very first questionsnasked me to check a box for my race:,White, black, Asian, or Native American. 
 I wasn't quite surenhow to answer the question.,Was it aimed at measuring the diversity,of research participants'nsocial backgrounds?,In that case, I would answernwith my social identity,,and check the box for "black.",But what if the researchersnwere interested in investigating,some association between ancestrynand the risk for certain genetic traits?,In that case, wouldn't they want to knownsomething about my ancestry,,which is just as much European as African?,And how could they makenscientific findings about my genes,if I put down my social identitynas a black woman?,After all, I consider myselfna black woman with a white father,rather than a white womannwith a black mother,entirely for social reasons.,Which racial identity I check,has nothing to do with my genes.,Well, despite the obviousnimportance of this question,to the study's scientific validity,,I was told, "Don't worry about it,,just put down howevernyou identify yourself.",So I check "black,",but I had no confidencenin the results of a study,that treated a critical variablenso unscientifically. 
 That personal experiencenwith the use of race in genetic testing,got me thinking:,Where else in medicine is race usednto make false biological predictions? 
 Well, I found out that race runs deeplynthroughout all of medical practice.,It shapes physicians' diagnoses,,measurements, treatments,,prescriptions,,even the very definition of diseases.,And the more I found out,nthe more disturbed I became. 
 Sociologists like me have long explained,that race is a social construction.,When we identify people as black,nwhite, Asian, Native American, Latina,,we're referring to social groupings,with made up demarcationsnthat have changed over time,and vary around the world.,As a legal scholar, I've also studied,how lawmakers, not biologists,,have invented the legalndefinitions of races. 
 And it's not just the viewnof social scientists.,You remember when the mapnof the human genome,was unveiled at a White Housenceremony in June 2000?,President Bill Clinton famously declared,,"I believe one of the great truths,to emerge from this triumphant expedition,inside the human genome,is that in genetic terms,,human beings, regardless of race,,are more than 99.9 percent the same.",And he might have added,that that less than one percentnof genetic difference,doesn't fall into racial boxes. 
 Francis Collins, who lednthe Human Genome Project,and now heads NIH,,echoed President Clinton.,"I am happy that today,,the only race we're talking aboutnis the human race." 
 Doctors are supposed to practicenevidence-based medicine,,and they're increasingly callednto join the genomic revolution.,But their habit of treating patientsnby race lags far behind. 
 Take the estimate,of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.,Doctors routinely interpret GFR,,this important indicatornof kidney function, by race.,As you can see in this lab test,,the exact same creatinine level,,the concentrationnin the blood of the patient,,automatically producesna different GFR estimate,depending on whether or notnthe patient is African-American.,Why? 
 I've been told it's based on an assumption,that African-Americansnhave more muscle mass,than people of other races.,But what sense does it make,for a doctor to automatically assume,I have more muscle massnthan that female bodybuilder?,Wouldn't it be far more accuratenand evidence-based,to determine the muscle massnof individual patients,just by looking at them? 
 Well, doctors tell menthey're using race as a shortcut.,It's a crude but convenient proxy,for more important factors,nlike muscle mass,,enzyme level, genetic traits,they just don't have time to look for.,But race is a bad proxy.,In many cases, race addsnno relevant information at all.,It's just a distraction.,But race also tends to overwhelmnthe clinical measures.,It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,,family illnesses,,their history, their own illnessesnthey might have --,all more evidence-basednthan the patient's race.,Race can't substitutenfor these important clinical measures,without sacrificing patient well-being. 
 Doctors also tell menrace is just one of many factors,they take into account,,but there are numerous medical tests,,like the GFR,,that use race categorically,to treat black, white,nAsian patients differently,just because of their race. 
 Race medicine also leavesnpatients of color especially vulnerable,to harmful biases and stereotypes.,Black and Latino patientsnare twice as likely,to receive no pain medication as whites,for the same painful long bone fractures,because of stereotypes,that black and brown peoplenfeel less pain,,exaggerate their pain,,and are predisposed to drug addiction. 
 The Food and Drug Administration has evennapproved a race-specific medicine.,It's a pill called BiDil,to treat heart failure in self-identifiednAfrican-American patients.,A cardiologist developed this drugnwithout regard to race or genetics,,but it became convenient,for commercial reasons,to market the drug to black patients.,The FDA then allowed,the company, the drug company,,to test the efficacy in a clinical trial,that only includednAfrican-American subjects.,It speculated,that race stood in as a proxynfor some unknown genetic factor,that affects heart disease,or response to drugs.,But think aboutnthe dangerous message it sent,,that black people's bodiesnare so substandard,,a drug tested in them,is not guaranteednto work in other patients. 
 In the end, the drug company'snmarketing scheme failed.,For one thing, black patientsnwere understandably wary,of using a drug just for black people.,One elderly black woman stood upnin a community meeting and shouted,,"Give me what the whitenpeople are taking!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you find race-specificnmedicine surprising,,wait until you learn,that many doctors in the United States,still use an updated version,of a diagnostic tool,that was developed by a physiciannduring the slavery era,,a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked,to justifications for slavery. 
 Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated,from the Universitynof Pennsylvania Medical School.,He practiced in the Deep Southnbefore the Civil War,,and he was a well-known expertnon what was then called "Negro medicine.",He promoted the racial concept of disease,,that people of different racesnsuffer from different diseases,and experiencencommon diseases differently.,Cartwright argued in the 1850s,that slavery was beneficialnfor black people,for medical reasons.,He claimed that because black peoplenhave lower lung capacity than whites,,forced labor was good for them.,He wrote in a medical journal,,"It is the red vital bloodnsent to the brain,that liberates their mindsnwhen under the white man's control,,and it is the want of sufficiencynof red vital blood,that chains their minds to ignorancenand barbarism when in freedom.",To support this theory,nCartwright helped to perfect,a medical device for measuring breathingncalled the spirometer,to show the presumed deficiencynin black people's lungs. 
 Today, doctors stillnuphold Cartwright's claim,the black people as a race,have lower lung capacitynthan white people.,Some even use a modern day spirometer,that actually has a button labeled "race",so the machine adjusts the measurement,for each patientnaccording to his or her race.,It's a well-known functionncalled "correcting for race." 
 The problem with race medicinenextends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.,Its focus on innatenracial differences in disease,diverts attention and resources,from the social determinants,that cause appallingnracial gaps in health:,lack of accessnto high-quality medical care;,food deserts in poor neighborhoods;,exposure to environmental toxins;,high rates of incarceration;,and experiencing the stressnof racial discrimination. 
 You see, race is not a biological category,that naturally producesnthese health disparities,because of genetic difference.,Race is a social category,that has staggeringnbiological consequences,,but because of the impactnof social inequality on people's health.,Yet race medicine pretendsnthe answer to these gaps in health,can be found in a race-specific pill.,It's much easier and more lucrative,to market a technological fix,for these gaps in health,than to deal with the structuralninequities that produce them. 
 The reason I'm so passionatenabout ending race medicine,isn't just because it's bad medicine.,I'm also on this mission,because the way doctors practice medicine,continues to promotena false and toxic view of humanity.,Despite the many visionary breakthroughsnin medicine we've been learning about,,there's a failure of imagination,when it comes to race.,Would you imagine with me, just a moment:,What would happen if doctorsnstopped treating patients by race?,Suppose they rejected,an 18th-century classification system,and incorporated insteadnthe most advanced knowledge,of human genetic diversity and unity,,that human beings cannot be categorizedninto biological races?,What if, instead of using racenas a crude proxy,for some more important factor,,doctors actually investigatednand addressed that more important factor?,What if doctors joined the forefront,of a movement to endnthe structural inequities,caused by racism,,not by genetic difference? 
 Race medicine is bad medicine,,it's poor science,and it's a falseninterpretation of humanity.,It is more urgent than ever,to finally abandon this backward legacy,and to affirm our common humanity,by ending the social inequalitiesnthat truly divide us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thanks.,Thank you.When I was first learning to meditate,,the instruction was to simplynpay attention to my breath,,and when my mind wandered,nto bring it back. 
 Sounded simple enough.,Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,,sweating through T-shirtsnin the middle of winter.,I'd take naps every chance I gotnbecause it was really hard work.,Actually, it was exhausting.,The instruction was simple enough,but I was missing somethingnreally important. 
 So why is it so hard to pay attention?,Well, studies show,that even when we're reallyntrying to pay attention to something --,like maybe this talk --,at some point,,about half of usnwill drift off into a daydream,,or have this urgento check our Twitter feed. 
 So what's going on here?,It turns out that we're fighting onenof the most evolutionarily-conserved,learning processesncurrently known in science,,one that's conserved,back to the most basicnnervous systems known to man. 
 This reward-based learning process,is called positivenand negative reinforcement,,and basically goes like this.,We see some food that looks good,,our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!",We eat the food, we taste it --,it tastes good.,And especially with sugar,,our bodies send a signalnto our brain that says,,"Remember what you're eatingnand where you found it.",We lay down this context-dependent memory,and learn to repeat the process next time.,See food,,eat food, feel good,,repeat.,Trigger, behavior, reward. 
 Simple, right?,Well, after a while,nour creative brains say,,"You know what?,You can use this for morenthan just remembering where food is.,You know, next time you feel bad,,why don't you try eatingnsomething good so you'll feel better?",We thank our brains for the great idea,,try this and quickly learn,that if we eat chocolate or ice creamnwhen we're mad or sad,,we feel better. 
 Same process,,just a different trigger.,Instead of this hunger signalncoming from our stomach,,this emotional signal -- feeling sad --,triggers that urge to eat. 
 Maybe in our teenage years,,we were a nerd at school,,and we see those rebel kidsnoutside smoking and we think,,"Hey, I want to be cool.",So we start smoking.,The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,nand that was no accident.,See cool,,smoke to be cool,,feel good. Repeat.,Trigger, behavior, reward.,And each time we do this,,we learn to repeat the process,and it becomes a habit.,So later,,feeling stressed out triggersnthat urge to smoke a cigarette,or to eat something sweet. 
 Now, with these same brain processes,,we've gone from learning to survive,to literally killing ourselvesnwith these habits.,Obesity and smoking,are among the leading preventable causesnof morbidity and mortality in the world. 
 So back to my breath.,What if instead of fighting our brains,,or trying to force ourselvesnto pay attention,,we instead tapped into this natural,nreward-based learning process ...,but added a twist?,What if instead we just got really curious,about what was happeningnin our momentary experience? 
 I'll give you an example.,In my lab,,we studied whether mindfulness trainingncould help people quit smoking.,Now, just like trying to force myselfnto pay attention to my breath,,they could try to forcenthemselves to quit smoking.,And the majority of themnhad tried this before and failed --,on average, six times. 
 Now, with mindfulness training,,we dropped the bit about forcingnand instead focused on being curious.,In fact, we even told them to smoke.,What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,,just be really curiousnabout what it's like when you do." 
 And what did they notice?,Well here's an examplenfrom one of our smokers.,She said, "Mindful smoking:,smells like stinky cheese,and tastes like chemicals,,YUCK!",Now, she knew, cognitivelynthat smoking was bad for her,,that's why she joined our program.,What she discovered just by beingncuriously aware when she smoked,was that smoking tastes like shit. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.,She moved from knowing in her headnthat smoking was bad for her,to knowing it in her bones,,and the spell of smoking was broken.,She started to becomendisenchanted with her behavior. 
 Now, the prefrontal cortex,,that youngest part of our brainnfrom an evolutionary perspective,,it understands on an intellectual levelnthat we shouldn't smoke.,And it tries its hardestnto help us change our behavior,,to help us stop smoking,,to help us stop eating that second,nthat third, that fourth cookie.,We call this cognitive control.,We're using cognitionnto control our behavior.,Unfortunately,,this is also the first part of our brain,that goes offlinenwhen we get stressed out,,which isn't that helpful. 
 Now, we can all relate to thisnin our own experience.,We're much more likely to do thingsnlike yell at our spouse or kids,when we're stressed out or tired,,even though we knownit's not going to be helpful.,We just can't help ourselves. 
 When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,,we fall back into our old habits,,which is why this disenchantmentnis so important.,Seeing what we get from our habits,helps us understand themnat a deeper level --,to know it in our bones,so we don't have to forcenourselves to hold back,or restrain ourselves from behavior.,We're just less interestednin doing it in the first place. 
 And this is what mindfulness is all about:,Seeing really clearly what we getnwhen we get caught up in our behaviors,,becoming disenchanted on a visceral level,and from this disenchanted stance,nnaturally letting go. 
 This isn't to say that, poof,nmagically we quit smoking.,But over time, as we learnnto see more and more clearly,the results of our actions,,we let go of old habits and form new ones. 
 The paradox here,is that mindfulness is justnabout being really interested,in getting close and personal,with what's actually happeningnin our bodies and minds,from moment to moment.,This willingnessnto turn toward our experience,rather than trying to make unpleasantncravings go away as quickly as possible.,And this willingnessnto turn toward our experience,is supported by curiosity,,which is naturally rewarding. 
 What does curiosity feel like?,It feels good.,And what happens when we get curious?,We start to notice that cravingsnare simply made up of body sensations --,oh, there's tightness, there's tension,,there's restlessness --,and that these bodynsensations come and go.,These are bite-size pieces of experiences,that we can manage from moment to moment,rather than getting clobberednby this huge, scary craving,that we choke on. 
 In other words, when we get curious,,we step out of our old,nfear-based, reactive habit patterns,,and we step into being.,We become this inner scientist,where we're eagerly awaitingnthat next data point. 
 Now, this might soundntoo simplistic to affect behavior.,But in one study,nwe found that mindfulness training,was twice as good as gold standard therapynat helping people quit smoking.,So it actually works. 
 And when we studiednthe brains of experienced meditators,,we found that parts of a neural networknof self-referential processing,called the default mode network,were at play.,Now, one current hypothesisnis that a region of this network,,called the posterior cingulate cortex,,is activated not necessarilynby craving itself,but when we get caught up in it,nwhen we get sucked in,,and it takes us for a ride. 
 In contrast, when we let go --,step out of the process,just by being curiously awarenof what's happening --,this same brain region quiets down. 
 Now we're testing app and online-basednmindfulness training programs,that target these core mechanisms,and, ironically, use the same technologynthat's driving us to distraction,to help us step outnof our unhealthy habit patterns,of smoking, of stress eatingnand other addictive behaviors. 
 Now, remember that bitnabout context-dependent memory?,We can deliver these toolsnto peoples' fingertips,in the contexts that matter most.,So we can help them,tap into their inherent capacitynto be curiously aware,right when that urge to smokenor stress eat or whatever arises. 
 So if you don't smoke or stress eat,,maybe the next time you feel this urgento check your email when you're bored,,or you're trying to distractnyourself from work,,or maybe to compulsively respondnto that text message when you're driving,,see if you can tap intonthis natural capacity,,just be curiously aware,of what's happening in your bodynand mind in that moment.,It will just be another chance,to perpetuate one of our endlessnand exhaustive habit loops ...,or step out of it. 
 Instead of see text message,ncompulsively text back,,feel a little bit better --,notice the urge,,get curious,,feel the joy of letting go,and repeat. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I moved to Harare in 1985,,social justice was at the corenof Zimbabwe's national health policy.,The new government emergednfrom a long war of independence,and immediately proclaimedna socialist agenda:,health care services, primary education,became essentially free.,A massive expansionnof rural health centers,placed roughly 80 percentnof the population,less than a two-hour walknfrom these facilities,,a truly remarkable accomplishment.,In 1980, the year of independence,,25 percent of Zimbabwean childrennwere fully immunized.,By 1990, a mere decade later,,this proportion stood at 80 percent. 
 I felt tremendously privilegednto be part of this transformation,,a revolution.,The excitement,nthe camaraderie, was palpable.,Working side by sidenwith brilliant Zimbabweans --,scientists, doctors, activists --,I felt connected not onlynto an African independence movement,,but to a global progressivenpublic health movement. 
 But there were daunting challenges.,Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS casenin 1985, the year I arrived.,I had taken care of a few patientsnwith AIDS in the early 1980s,,when I did my medical trainingnat Harlem Hospital, but --,we had no ideanwhat lay in store for Africa.,Infection rate stood at aboutntwo percent in my early days there.,These would soar,to one out of every four adults,by the time I left Harare 17 years later.,By the mid-1990s,,I'd told hundreds of peoplenin the prime of life,that they were HIV-positive.,I saw colleagues and friends die,,my students, hospital patients, die. 
 In response, my colleagues and Inset up a clinic.,We did condom demonstrations.,We launched school educationnand workplace interventions.,We did research. We counselednthe partners of infected men,about how to protect themselves.,We worked hard, and at the time,nI believed that I was doing my best.,I was providing excellent treatment,,such as it was.,But I was not talkingnabout structural change. 
 Former UN Secretary Kofi Annannhas spoken candidly,about his personal failure,leading to the Rwandan genocide.,In 1994, he was headnof the UN peacekeeping department.,At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,,he reflected, "I believed at the timenI was doing my best,,but I realized after the genocide,that there was morenI could and should have done,to sound the alarm and rally support." 
 The AIDS epidemic caughtnthe health community unprepared,,and today, when the WorldnHealth Organization estimates,that 39 million peoplenhave lost their lives to this disease,,I'm not alone in feelingnremorse and regret,at not having done more earlier. 
 But while living in Zimbabwe,,I didn't see my rolenas an advocacy or a political one.,I was there for my technical skills,,both my clinical and my researchnepidemiology skills.,And in my mind, my jobnwas to take care of patients,and to do research to better understandnthe population patterns of transmission,,and I hoped that we'd slownthe spread of the virus.,I was aware that socially marginalizednpopulations were at disproportionate risk,of getting and dying of AIDS.,And on the sugar plantations,,which really more closelynresembled feudal fiefdoms,than any modern enterprise,,60 percent of pregnant women,tested HIV-positive. 
 I worked to show how getting infectednwas not a moral failure,but instead relatednto a culture of male superiority,,to forced migrant labornand to colonialism.,Whites were largely unscathed. 
 As health professionals,,our tools were pitifully weak:,imploring people to changentheir individual behaviors,,use condoms, reduce number of partners.,Infection rates climbed,,and when treatmentnbecame available in the West,,treatment that remainsnour most potent weapon,against this virus,,it was unaffordablento the public sector across Africa.,I didn't speak out,about the unequal accessnto these life-saving drugs,or about the underlyingneconomic and political systems,that were driving infection rates,in such huge swaths of the population.,I rationalized my silence,by reminding myselfnthat I was a guest in the country,,that sounding the alarmncould even get me kicked out,,keep me from doing good work,,taking care of my patients,,doing much-needed research.,So I didn't speak out,about the government'snearly stance on AIDS.,I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough. 
 Many doctors, health professionals,,may think I did nothing wrong.,Our pact with our patients,,the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,,is about the sanctitynof the patient-doctor relationship.,And I did everything I could,for each and every patient of mine. 
 But I knew,that epidemics emergenalong the fissures of our society,,reflecting not only biology,,but more importantlynpatterns of marginalization, exclusion,,discrimination related to race,ngender, sexuality, class and more.,It was true of AIDS.,It was true just recently of Ebola.,Medical anthropologistsnsuch as Paul Farmer,,who worked on AIDS in Haiti,,call this structural violence:,structural because inequities are embedded,in the political and economicnorganization of our social world,,often in ways that are invisiblento those with privilege and power;,and violence because its impact --,premature deaths,nsuffering, illness -- is violent.,We do little for our patients,if we fail to recognize,these social injustices.,Sounding the alarm is the first stepntowards doing public health right,,and it's how we may rally support,to break throughnand create real change together. 
 So these days, I'm not staying quiet.,I'm speaking up about a lot of things,,even when it makes listenersnuncomfortable,,even when it makes me uncomfortable.,And a lot of thisnis about racial disparities,and institutionalized racism,,things that we're not supposednto have in this country anymore,,certainly not in the practice of medicine,or public health.,But we have them,,and we pay for them in lives cut short.,That's why sounding the alarm,about the impact of racism on healthnin the United States,,the ongoing institutionalnand interpersonal violence,that people of color face,,compounded by our tragic legacy,of 250 years of slavery,,90 years of Jim Crow,and 60 years of imperfect equality,,sounding the alarm about this,is central to doing my job right,as New York City's Health Commissioner.,In New York City, premature mortality --nthat's death before the age of 65 --,is 50 percent highernfor black men than white ones.,A black woman in 2012,faced more than 10 timesnthe risk of dying related to childbirth,as a white woman.,And though we've made enormous strides,in reducing infant mortality rates,,a black baby still faces,nearly three times the risknof death in its first year of life,as compared to a white baby. 
 New York City's not exceptional.,These statistics are paralleled,by statistics foundnacross the United States.,A recent New York Times analysis,reported that there are 1.5 millionnmissing black men across the country.,They noted that more than one,out of every six black men,who today should benbetween the ages of 25 and 54 years,have disappeared from daily life,,lost either to prison or premature death.,There is great injustice,in the daily and disproportionate violencenfaced by young black men,,the focus of recent protestsnunder the banner #BlackLivesMatter.,But we have to remember,that enduring and disparate rates,and the occurrence and outcomenof common medical conditions --,heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV --,diseases that may kill slowly and quietly,and take even morenblack lives prematurely. 
 As the #BlackLivesMatternmovement unfolded,,I felt frustrated and angry,that the medical community,has been reluctantnto even use the word "racism",in our research and our work.,You've probably felt somethingnevery time I've said it.,Our medical studentsnheld die-ins in their white coats,,but the medical communitynhas largely stood by passively,as ongoing discriminationncontinues to affect,the disease profile and mortality.,And I worry,that the trend towards personalizednand precision medicine,,looking for biological or genetic targetsnto better tailor treatment,,may inadvertently cause usnto lose sight of the big picture,,that it is the daily context,,where a person lives, grows,,works, loves,,that most importantlyndetermines population health,,and for too many of us, poor health. 
 As health professionals in our daily work,,whether in the clinic or doing research,,we are witness to great injustice:,the homeless personnwho is unable to follow medical advice,because he has more pressing priorities;,the transgender youthnwho is contemplating suicide,because our society is just so harsh;,the single mother who has been madento feel that she is responsible,for the poor health of her child. 
 Our role as health professionals,is not just to treat our patients,but to sound the alarm,and advocate for change.,Rightfully or not,,our societal positionngives our voices great credibility,,and we shouldn't waste that. 
 I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,,and I've promised myself,that as New York City'snHealth Commissioner,,I will use every opportunity I have,to sound the alarm,and rally support for health equity.,I will speak out against racism,,and I hope you will join me,,and I will join younwhen you speak out against sexism,or any other form of inequality.,It's time for us to rise up,and collectively speak up,about structural inequality.,We don't have to have all the answers,to call for change.,We just need courage.,The health of our patients,,the health of us all, depends on it. 
 (Applause)You are a high-rankingnmilitary service member,deployed to Afghanistan.,You are responsible for the lives,of hundreds of men and women,,and your base is under attack.,Incoming mortar roundsnare exploding all around you.,Struggling to seenthrough the dust and the smoke,,you do your best to assist the wounded,and then crawl to a nearby bunker. 
 Conscious but dazed by the blasts,,you lay on your side and attemptnto process what has just happened.,As you regain your vision,,you see a bloody face,staring back at you.,The image is terrifying,,but you quickly come to understand,it's not real. 
 This vision continues to visit younmultiple times a day and in your sleep.,You choose not to tell anyonenfor fear of losing your job,or being seen as weak.,You give the vision a name,,Bloody Face in Bunker,,and call it BFIB for short.,You keep BFIB locked away in your mind,,secretly haunting you,,for the next seven years. 
 Now close your eyes.,Can you see BFIB?,If you can, you're beginningnto see the face,of the invisible wounds of war,,commonly knownnas post-traumatic stress disorder,and traumatic brain injury. 
 While I can't say I havenpost-traumatic stress disorder,,I've never been a stranger to it. 
 When I was a little girl, I would visitnmy grandparents every summer.,It was my grandfather,who introduced me to the effectsnof combat on the psyche.,While my grandfather was servingnas a Marine in the Korean War,,a bullet pierced his necknand rendered him unable to cry out.,He watched as a corpsman passed him over,,declaring him a goner,,and then leaving him to die. 
 Years later, after hisnphysical wounds had healed,and he'd returned home,,he rarely spoke of hisnexperiences in waking life.,But at night I would hear himnshouting obscenities,from his room down the hall.,And during the day I would announce myselfnas I entered the room,,careful not to startle or agitate him.,He lived out the remainder of his days,isolated and tight-lipped,,never finding a way to express himself,,and I didn't yetnhave the tools to guide him. 
 I wouldn't have a namenfor my grandfather's condition,until I was in my 20s.,Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,,I naturally gravitatedntowards the study of trauma.,And while sitting in class learningnabout post-traumatic stress disorder,,or PTSD for short,,my mission to help service membersnwho suffered like my grandfather,began to take form. 
 We've had various namesnfor post-traumatic stress,throughout the history of war:,homesickness,,soldier's heart,,shell shock,,thousand-yard stare, for instance.,And while I was pursuing my degree,na new war was raging,,and thanks to modern body armornand military vehicles,,service members were survivingnblast injuries they wouldn't have before.,But the invisible woundsnwere reaching new levels,,and this pushed military doctorsnand researchers,to try and truly understand the effectsnthat traumatic brain injury, or TBI,,and PTSD have on the brain. 
 Due to advancesnin technology and neuroimaging,,we now know there'snan actual shutdown in the Broca's,,or the speech-language area of the brain,nafter an individual experiences trauma.,This physiological change,,or speechless terror as it's often called,,coupled with mental health stigma,,the fear of being judged,or misunderstood,,possibly even removednfrom their current duties,,has led to the invisible strugglesnof our servicemen and women.,Generation after generation of veterans,have chosen not to talknabout their experiences,,and suffer in solitude. 
 I had my work cut out for menwhen I got my first job,as an art therapist at the nation'snlargest military medical center,,Walter Reed.,After working for a few yearsnon a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,,I eventually transferred to the NationalnIntrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,,which leads TBI carenfor active duty service members.,Now, I believed in art therapy,,but I was going to havento convince service members,,big, tough, strong, manly military men,,and some women too,,to give art-making asna psychotherapeutic intervention a try. 
 The results have beennnothing short of spectacular.,Vivid, symbolic artwork,is being creatednby our servicemen and women,,and every work of art tells a story.,We've observed that the processnof art therapy bypasses,the speech-language issue with the brain.,Art-making accesses the same sensorynareas of the brain that encode trauma.,Service members can use the art-makingnto work through their experiences,in a nonthreatening way.,They can then apply wordsnto their physical creations,,reintegrating the leftnand the right hemispheres of the brain. 
 Now, we've seen this can worknwith all forms of art --,drawing, painting, collage --,but what seems to have the most impact,is mask-making.,Finally, these invisible woundsndon't just have a name,,they have a face. 
 And when service membersncreate these masks,,it allows them to come to grips,nliterally, with their trauma.,And it's amazingnhow often that enables them,to break through the traumanand start to heal. 
 Remember BFIB?,That was a real experiencenfor one of my patients,,and when he created his mask,,he was able to let gonof that haunting image.,Initially, it was a daunting processnfor the service member,,but eventually he begannto think of BFIB as the mask,,not his internal wound,,and he would go to leave each session,,he would hand me the mask,nand say, "Melissa, take care of him.",Eventually, we placed BFIB in a boxnto further contain him,,and when the service membernwent to leave the NICoE,,he chose to leave BFIB behind.,A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,,and both times BFIB was smiling,and the service memberndidn't feel anxious.,Now, whenever that service membernis haunted by some traumatic memory,,he continues to paint.,Every time he paintsnthese disturbing images,,he sees them less or not at all. 
 Philosophers have told usnfor thousands of years,that the power to create,is very closely linkednto the power to destroy.,Now science is showing usnthat the part of the brain,that registers a traumatic wound,can be the part of the brainnwhere healing happens too.,And art therapy is showing usnhow to make that connection. 
 We asked one of our service members,to describe how mask-makingnimpacted his treatment,,and this is what he had to say. 
 (Video) Service Member:nYou sort of just zone out into the mask.,You zone out into the drawing,,and for me, it just released the block,,so I was able to do it.,And then when I looked at itnafter two days, I was like,,"Holy crap, here's the picture,nhere's the key, here's the puzzle,",and then from there it just soared.,I mean, from therenmy treatment just when out of sight,,because they were like,nKurt, explain this, explain this.,And for the first time in 23 years,,I could actually talk about stuffnopenly to, like, anybody.,I could talk to you about itnright now if I wanted to,,because it unlocked it.,It's just amazing.,And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD,and TBI stuff together in one place,that has never happened before.,Sorry. 
 Melissa Walker: Over the past five years,,we've had over 1,000 masks made.,It's pretty amazing, isn't it? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),I wish I could have sharednthis process with my grandfather,,but I know that he would be thrilled,that we are finding ways,to help today's and tomorrow'snservice members heal,,and finding the resources within them,that they can call upon,to heal themselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So you go to the doctornand get some tests.,The doctor determinesnthat you have high cholesterol,and you would benefitnfrom medication to treat it.,So you get a pillbox.,You have some confidence,,your physician has some confidencenthat this is going to work.,The company that invented it didna lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.,They studied it very carefully,nskeptically, they approved it.,They have a rough idea of how it works,,they have a rough ideanof what the side effects are.,It should be OK.,You have a little morenof a conversation with your physician,and the physician is a little worriednbecause you've been blue,,haven't felt like yourself,,you haven't been able to enjoy thingsnin life quite as much as you usually do.,Your physician says, "You know,nI think you have some depression.,I'm going to have to givenyou another pill." 
 So now we're talkingnabout two medications.,This pill also -- millionsnof people have taken it,,the company did studies,nthe FDA looked at it -- all good.,Think things should go OK.,Think things should go OK.,Well, wait a minute.,How much have we studiednthese two together? 
 Well, it's very hard to do that.,In fact, it's not traditionally done.,We totally depend on what we calln"post-marketing surveillance,",after the drugs hit the market.,How can we figure outnif bad things are happening,between two medications?,Three? Five? Seven?,Ask your favorite personnwho has several diagnoses,how many medications they're on. 
 Why do I care about this problem?,I care about it deeply.,I'm an informatics and data science guynand really, in my opinion,,the only hope -- only hope --nto understand these interactions,is to leverage lotsnof different sources of data,in order to figure outnwhen drugs can be used together safely,and when it's not so safe. 
 So let me tell you a data science story.,And it begins with my student Nick.,Let's call him "Nick,"nbecause that's his name. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nick was a young student.,I said, "You know, Nick, we havento understand how drugs work,and how they work togethernand how they work separately,,and we don't have a great understanding.,But the FDA has made availablenan amazing database.,It's a database of adverse events.,They literally put on the web --,publicly available, you could allndownload it right now --,hundreds of thousandsnof adverse event reports,from patients, doctors,ncompanies, pharmacists.,And these reports are pretty simple:,it has all the diseasesnthat the patient has,,all the drugs that they're on,,and all the adverse events,nor side effects, that they experience.,It is not all of the adverse eventsnthat are occurring in America today,,but it's hundreds and hundredsnof thousands of drugs. 
 So I said to Nick,,"Let's think about glucose.,Glucose is very important,nand we know it's involved with diabetes.,Let's see if we can understandnglucose response.,I sent Nick off. Nick came back. 
 "Russ," he said,,"I've created a classifier that cannlook at the side effects of a drug,based on looking at this database,,and can tell you whether that drugnis likely to change glucose or not." 
 He did it. It was very simple, in a way.,He took all the drugsnthat were known to change glucose,and a bunch of drugsnthat don't change glucose,,and said, "What's the differencenin their side effects?,Differences in fatigue? In appetite?nIn urination habits?",All those things conspirednto give him a really good predictor.,He said, "Russ, I can predictnwith 93 percent accuracy,when a drug will change glucose." 
 I said, "Nick, that's great.",He's a young student,nyou have to build his confidence.,"But Nick, there's a problem.,It's that every physician in the worldnknows all the drugs that change glucose,,because it's core to our practice.,So it's great, good job,nbut not really that interesting,,definitely not publishable." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "I know, Russ.nI thought you might say that.",Nick is smart.,"I thought you might say that,nso I did one other experiment.,I looked at people in this databasenwho were on two drugs,,and I looked for signals similar,nglucose-changing signals,,for people taking two drugs,,where each drug alonendid not change glucose,,but together I saw a strong signal." 
 And I said, "Oh! You're clever.nGood idea. Show me the list.",And there's a bunch of drugs,nnot very exciting.,But what caught my eyenwas, on the list there were two drugs:,paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;,and pravastatin, or Pravachol,na cholesterol medication. 
 And I said, "Huh. There are millionsnof Americans on those two drugs.",In fact, we learned later,,15 million Americans on paroxetinenat the time, 15 million on pravastatin,,and a million, we estimated, on both.,So that's a million people,who might be having some problemsnwith their glucose,if this machine-learning mumbo jumbonthat he did in the FDA database,actually holds up.,But I said, "It's still not publishable,,because I love what you didnwith the mumbo jumbo,,with the machine learning,,but it's not really standard-of-proofnevidence that we have.",So we have to do something else.,Let's go into the Stanfordnelectronic medical record.,We have a copy of itnthat's OK for research,,we removed identifying information.,And I said, "Let's see if peoplenon these two drugs,have problems with their glucose." 
 Now there are thousandsnand thousands of people,in the Stanford medical recordsnthat take paroxetine and pravastatin.,But we needed special patients.,We needed patients who were on one of themnand had a glucose measurement,,then got the second one and hadnanother glucose measurement,,all within a reasonable period of time --nsomething like two months.,And when we did that,nwe found 10 patients.,However, eight out of the 10nhad a bump in their glucose,when they got the second P --nwe call this P and P --,when they got the second P.,Either one could be first,nthe second one comes up,,glucose went upn20 milligrams per deciliter.,Just as a reminder,,you walk around normally,nif you're not diabetic,,with a glucose of around 90.,And if it gets up to 120, 125,,your doctor begins to thinknabout a potential diagnosis of diabetes.,So a 20 bump -- pretty significant. 
 I said, "Nick, this is very cool.,But, I'm sorry, we stillndon't have a paper,,because this is 10 patientsnand -- give me a break --,it's not enough patients." 
 So we said, what can we do?,And we said, let's call our friendsnat Harvard and Vanderbilt,,who also -- Harvard in Boston,nVanderbilt in Nashville,,who also have electronicnmedical records similar to ours.,Let's see if they can findnsimilar patients,with the one P, the other P,nthe glucose measurements,in that range that we need. 
 God bless them, Vanderbiltnin one week found 40 such patients,,same trend.,Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.,So at the end, we had 150 patientsnfrom three diverse medical centers,that were telling us that patientsngetting these two drugs,were having their glucose bumpnsomewhat significantly. 
 More interestingly,nwe had left out diabetics,,because diabetics alreadynhave messed up glucose.,When we lookednat the glucose of diabetics,,it was going up 60 milligramsnper deciliter, not just 20.,This was a big deal, and we said,n"We've got to publish this.",We submitted the paper.,It was all data evidence,,data from the FDA, data from Stanford,,data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.,We had not done a single real experiment. 
 But we were nervous.,So Nick, while the papernwas in review, went to the lab.,We found somebodynwho knew about lab stuff.,I don't do that.,I take care of patients,nbut I don't do pipettes.,They taught us how to feed mice drugs.,We took mice and we gave themnone P, paroxetine.,We gave some other mice pravastatin.,And we gave a third groupnof mice both of them.,And lo and behold, glucose went upn20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter,in the mice. 
 So the paper was acceptednbased on the informatics evidence alone,,but we added a little note at the end,,saying, oh by the way,nif you give these to mice, it goes up. 
 That was great, and the storyncould have ended there.,But I still have six and a half minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we were sitting aroundnthinking about all of this,,and I don't remember who thoughtnof it, but somebody said,,"I wonder if patientsnwho are taking these two drugs,are noticing side effectsnof hyperglycemia.,They could and they should.,How would we ever determine that?" 
 We said, well, what do you do?,You're taking a medication,none new medication or two,,and you get a funny feeling.,What do you do?,You go to Google,and type in the two drugs you're takingnor the one drug you're taking,,and you type in "side effects.",What are you experiencing?,So we said OK,,let's ask Google if they will sharentheir search logs with us,,so that we can look at the search logs,and see if patients are doingnthese kinds of searches.,Google, I am sorry to say,ndenied our request.,So I was bummed.,I was at a dinner with a colleaguenwho works at Microsoft Research,and I said, "We wanted to do this study,,Google said no, it's kind of a bummer.",He said, "Well, we haventhe Bing searches." 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,That's great.,Now I felt like I was -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I felt like I was talking to Nick again.,He works for one of the largestncompanies in the world,,and I'm already tryingnto make him feel better.,But he said, "No, Russ --nyou might not understand.,We not only have Bing searches,,but if you use Internet Explorernto do searches at Google,,Yahoo, Bing, any ...,Then, for 18 months, we keep that datanfor research purposes only.",I said, "Now you're talking!",This was Eric Horvitz,nmy friend at Microsoft. 
 So we did a study,where we defined 50 wordsnthat a regular person might type in,if they're having hyperglycemia,,like "fatigue," "loss of appetite,"n"urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" --,forgive me, but that's onenof the things you might type in.,So we had 50 phrasesnthat we called the "diabetes words.",And we did first a baseline.,And it turns outnthat about .5 to one percent,of all searches on the Internetninvolve one of those words.,So that's our baseline rate.,If people type in "paroxetine"nor "Paxil" -- those are synonyms --,and one of those words,,the rate goes up to about two percentnof diabetes-type words,,if you already knownthat there's that "paroxetine" word.,If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes upnto about three percent from the baseline.,If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin"nare present in the query,,it goes up to 10 percent,,a huge three- to four-fold increase,in those searches with the two drugsnthat we were interested in,,and diabetes-type wordsnor hyperglycemia-type words. 
 We published this,,and it got some attention.,The reason it deserves attention,is that patients are telling usntheir side effects indirectly,through their searches.,We brought thisnto the attention of the FDA.,They were interested.,They have set up social mediansurveillance programs,to collaborate with Microsoft,,which had a nice infrastructurenfor doing this, and others,,to look at Twitter feeds,,to look at Facebook feeds,,to look at search logs,,to try to see early signs that drugs,neither individually or together,,are causing problems. 
 What do I take from this?nWhy tell this story?,Well, first of all,,we have now the promisenof big data and medium-sized data,to help us understand drug interactions,and really, fundamentally, drug actions.,How do drugs work?,This will create and has createdna new ecosystem,for understanding how drugs worknand to optimize their use.,Nick went on; he's a professornat Columbia now.,He did this in his PhDnfor hundreds of pairs of drugs.,He found severalnvery important interactions,,and so we replicated this,and we showed that thisnis a way that really works,for finding drug-drug interactions. 
 However, there's a couple of things.,We don't just use pairsnof drugs at a time.,As I said before, there are patientsnon three, five, seven, nine drugs.,Have they been studied with respectnto their nine-way interaction?,Yes, we can do pair-wise,nA and B, A and C, A and D,,but what about A, B, C,nD, E, F, G all together,,being taken by the same patient,,perhaps interacting with each other,in ways that either makes themnmore effective or less effective,or causes side effectsnthat are unexpected?,We really have no idea.,It's a blue sky, open fieldnfor us to use data,to try to understandnthe interaction of drugs. 
 Two more lessons:,I want you to think about the powernthat we were able to generate,with the data from people who hadnvolunteered their adverse reactions,through their pharmacists,nthrough themselves, through their doctors,,the people who allowed the databasesnat Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,,to be used for research.,People are worried about data.,They're worried about their privacynand security -- they should be.,We need secure systems.,But we can't have a systemnthat closes that data off,,because it is too rich of a source,of inspiration, innovation and discovery,for new things in medicine. 
 And the final thing I want to say is,,in this case we found two drugsnand it was a little bit of a sad story.,The two drugs actually caused problems.,They increased glucose.,They could throw somebody into diabetes,who would otherwise not be in diabetes,,and so you would want to usenthe two drugs very carefully together,,perhaps not together,,make different choicesnwhen you're prescribing.,But there was another possibility.,We could have foundntwo drugs or three drugs,that were interacting in a beneficial way.,We could have found new effects of drugs,that neither of them has alone,,but together, insteadnof causing a side effect,,they could be a new and novel treatment,for diseases that don't have treatments,or where the treatments are not effective.,If we think about drug treatment today,,all the major breakthroughs --,for HIV, for tuberculosis,nfor depression, for diabetes --,it's always a cocktail of drugs. 
 And so the upside here,,and the subject for a differentnTED Talk on a different day,,is how can we use the same data sources,to find good effectsnof drugs in combination,that will provide us new treatments,,new insights into how drugs work,and enable us to take carenof our patients even better? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I was three months pregnant with twins,when my husband Ross and Inwent to my second sonogram. 
 I was 35 years old at the time,,and I knew that that meantnwe had a higher risk,of having a child with a birth defect.,So, Ross and I researchednthe standard birth defects,,and we felt reasonably prepared. 
 Well, nothing would have prepared us,for the bizarre diagnosisnthat we were about to face.,The doctor explainednthat one of our twins, Thomas,,had a fatal birth defectncalled anencephaly.,This means that his brainnwas not formed correctly,because part of his skull was missing.,Babies with this diagnosisntypically die in utero,or within a few minutes, hoursnor days of being born.,But the other twin, Callum,,appeared to be healthy,nas far as the doctor could tell,,and these twins were identical,,genetically identical. 
 So after a lot of questions aboutnhow this could have possibly happened,,a selective reduction was mentioned,,and while this procedurenwas not impossible,,it posed some unique risksnfor the healthy twin and for me,,so we decided to carrynthe pregnancy to term.,So there I was, three months pregnant,nwith two trimesters ahead of me,,and I had to find a way to managenmy blood pressure and my stress.,And it felt like having a roommatenpoint a loaded gun at you for six months.,But I stared downnthe barrel of that gun for so long,that I saw a lightnat the end of the tunnel.,While there was nothing we could donto prevent the tragedy,,I wanted to find a waynfor Thomas's brief life,to have some kind of positive impact. 
 So I asked my nurse about organ,neye and tissue donation.,She connected with our localnorgan-procurement organization,,the Washington RegionalnTransplant Community.,WRTC explained to me,that Thomas would probably be too smallnat birth to donate for transplant,,and I was shocked:,I didn't even knownyou could be rejected for that.,But they said that he would bena good candidate to donate for research.,This helped me see Thomas in a new light.,As opposed to just a victim of a disease,,I started to see him as a possible keynto unlock a medical mystery. 
 On March 23, 2010,,the twins were born,nand they were both born alive.,And just like the doctor said,,Thomas was missingnthe top part of his skull,,but he could nurse,,drink from a bottle,,cuddle and grab our fingersnlike a normal baby,,and he slept in our arms.,After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms,surrounded by our family. 
 We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home,and brought him to Children'snNational Medical Center.,A few hours later, we got a call to saynthat the recovery was a success,,and Thomas's donationsnwould be going to four different places.,His cord blood would gonto Duke University.,His liver would go to a cell-therapyncompany called Cytonet in Durham.,His corneas would gonto Schepens Eye Research Institute,,which is part of Harvard Medical School,,and his retinas would gonto the University of Pennsylvania. 
 A few days later, we had a funeralnwith our immediate family,,including baby Callum,,and we basicallynclosed this chapter in our lives.,But I did find myself wondering,nwhat's happening now?,What are the researchers learning?,And was it even worthwhile to donate? 
 WRTC invited Ross and Into a grief retreat,,and we met aboutn15 other grieving families,who had donated their loved one'snorgans for transplant.,Some of them had even received letters,from the people who receivedntheir loved one's organs,,saying thank you.,I learned that theyncould even meet each other,if they'd both sign a waiver,,almost like an open adoption.,And I was so excited,nI thought maybe I could write a letter,or I could get a letternand learn about what happened.,But I was disappointed to learn,that this process only existsnfor people who donate for transplant.,So I was jealous.nI had transplant envy, I guess. 
 (Laughter) 
 But over the years that followed,,I learned a lot more about donation,,and I even got a job in the field. 
 And I came up with an idea.,I wrote a letter that started out,,"Dear Researcher.",I explained who I was,,and I asked if they could tell menwhy they requested infant retinas,in March of 2010,,and I asked if my familyncould visit their lab.,I emailed it to the eye banknthat arranged the donation,,the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,,and asked if they couldnsend it to the right person.,They said that they hadnnever done this before,,and they couldn't guarantee a response,,but they wouldn't be an obstacle,nand they would deliver it. 
 Two days later, I got a response,from Dr. Arupa Gangulynof the University of Pennsylvania.,She thanked me for the donation,,and she explainednthat she is studying retinoblastoma,,which is a deadly cancer of the retina,that affects childrennunder the age of five,,and she said that yes,nwe were invited to visit her lab. 
 So next we talked on the phone,,and one of the first things she said to me,was that she couldn't possiblynimagine how we felt,,and that Thomas had givennthe ultimate sacrifice,,and that she seemednto feel indebted to us.,So I said, "Nothing against your study,,but we didn't actually pick it.,We donated to the system,nand the system chose your study.,I said, "And second of all,nbad things happen to children every day,,and if you didn't want these retinas,,they would probablynbe buried in the ground right now.,So to be able to participate in your study,gives Thomas's lifena new layer of meaning.,So, never feel guiltynabout using this tissue." 
 Next, she explained to me how rare it was.,She had placed a requestnfor this tissue six years earlier,with the National DiseasenResearch Interchange.,She got only one sample of tissuenthat fit her criteria,,and it was Thomas's. 
 Next, we arranged a date for mento come visit the lab,,and we chose March 23, 2015,nwhich was the twins' fifth birthday.,After we hung up, I emailed hernsome pictures of Thomas and Callum,,and a few weeks later,nwe received this T-shirt in the mail. 
 A few months later, Ross, Callumnand I piled in the car,and we went for a road trip.,We met Arupa and her staff,,and Arupa said that when I told hernnot to feel guilty, that it was a relief,,and that she hadn't seen itnfrom our perspective.,She also explained that Thomasnhad a secret code name.,The same way Henrietta Lacksnis called HeLa,,Thomas was called RES 360.,RES means research,,and 360 means he was the 360th specimen,over the course of about 10 years. 
 She also shared with us a unique document,,and it was the shipping label,that sent his retinasnfrom DC to Philadelphia.,This shipping labelnis like an heirloom to us now.,It's the same way that a military medalnor a wedding certificate might be. 
 Arupa also explained that she is usingnThomas's retina and his RNA,to try to inactivate the genenthat causes tumor formation,,and she even showed us some resultsnthat were based on RES 360.,Then she took us to the freezer,and she showed us the two samplesnthat she still has,that are still labeled RES 360.,There's two little ones left.,She said she saved it,because she doesn't knownwhen she might get more.,After this, we went to the conference room,and we relaxed and we had lunch together,,and the lab staff presented Callumnwith a birthday gift.,It was a child's lab kit.,And they also offered him an internship. 
 (Laughter) 
 So in closing, I have twonsimple messages today.,One is that most of us probablyndon't think about donating to research.,I know I didn't.nI think I'm a normal person.,But I did it.,It was a good experience,nand I recommend it,,and it brought my family a lot of peace.,And second is if you worknwith human tissue,and you wonder about the donornand about the family,,write them a letter.,Tell them you received it,ntell them what you're working on,,and invite them to visit your lab,,because that visit may beneven more gratifying for you,than it is for them.,And I'd also like to ask you a favor.,If you're ever successfulnin arranging one of these visits,,please tell me about it. 
 The other part of my family's story,is that we ended up visitingnall four facilities,that received Thomas's donations.,And we met amazing peoplendoing inspiring work.,The way I see it nownis that Thomas got into Harvard,,Duke and Penn -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And he has a job at Cytonet,,and he has colleagues and he has coworkers,who are in the top of their fields.,And they need himnin order to do their job.,And a life that once seemednbrief and insignificant,revealed itself to be vital,neverlasting and relevant.,And I only hope that my lifencan be as relevant. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Please meet Jane.,She has a high-risk pregnancy.,Within 24 weeks,,she's on bed rest at the hospital,,being monitorednfor her preterm contractions. 
 She doesn't look the happiest.,That's in part because it requiresntechnicians and experts,to apply these clunky belts on hernto monitor her uterine contractions.,Another reason Jane is not so happynis because she's worried.,In particular, she's worriednabout what happens,after her 10-day staynon bed rest at the hospital.,What happens when she's home?,If she were to give birth this earlynit would be devastating.,As an African-American woman,,she's twice as likelynto have a premature birth,or to have a stillbirth.,So Jane basically has one of two options:,stay at the hospital on bed rest,,a prisoner to the technologynuntil she gives birth,,and then spend the restnof her life paying for the bill;,or head home after her 10-day staynand hope for the best.,Neither of these two optionsnseems appealing. 
 As I began to thinknabout stories like this,and hear about stories like this,,I began to ask myself and imagine:,Is there an alternative?,Is there a way we could haventhe benefits of high-fidelity monitoring,that we get with our trustednpartners in the hospital,while someone is at homenliving their daily life? 
 With that in mind,,I encouraged people in my research group,to partner with somenclever material scientists,,and all of us came togethernand brainstormed.,And after a long process,,we came up with a vision, an idea,,of a wearable system that perhapsnyou could wear like a piece of jewelry,or you could applynto yourself like a Band-Aid.,And after many trials and tribulationsnand years of endeavors,,we were able to come upnwith this flexible electronic patch,that was manufacturednusing the same processes,that they use to build computer chips,,except the electronics are transferrednfrom a semiconductor wafer,onto a flexible materialnthat can interface with the human body. 
 These systems are aboutnthe thickness of a human hair.,They can measure the typesnof information that we want,,things such as:,bodily movement,,bodily temperature,,electrical rhythms of the body,and so forth.,We can also engineer these systems,,so they can integrate energy sources,,and can have wirelessntransmission capabilities. 
 So as we began to buildnthese types of systems,,we began to test them on ourselvesnin our research group.,But in addition, we began to reach outnto some of our clinical partners,in San Diego,,and test these on different patientsnin different clinical conditions,,including moms-to-be like Jane. 
 Here is a picture of a pregnant womannin labor at our university hospital,being monitored for her uterinencontractions with the conventional belt.,In addition,,our flexible electronic patches are there.,This picture demonstrates waveformsnpertaining to the fetal heart rate,,where the red correspondsnto what was acquired,with the conventional belts,,and the blue corresponds to our estimates,using our flexible electronic systemsnand our algorithms. 
 At this moment,,we gave ourselves a big mental high five.,Some of the things we had imaginednwere beginning to come to fruition,,and we were actually seeing thisnin a clinical context. 
 But there was still a problem.,The problem was, the waynwe manufactured these systems,was very inefficient,,had low yield,and was very error-prone.,In addition,,as we talked to somenof the nurses in the hospital,,they encouraged us to make sure,that our electronics workednwith typical medical adhesives,that are used in a hospital.,We had an epiphany and said,n"Wait a minute.,Rather than just makingnthem work with adhesives,,let's integrate them into adhesives,,and that could solvenour manufacturing problem." 
 This picture that you see here,is our ability to embed these censorsninside of a piece of Scotch tape,by simply peeling it off of a wafer.,Ongoing work in our research groupnallows us to, in addition,,embed integrated circuitsninto the flexible adhesives,to do things like amplifying signalsnand digitizing them,,processing them,and encoding for wireless transmission.,All of this integratedninto the same medical adhesives,that are used in the hospital. 
 So when we reached this point,,we had some other challenges,,from both an engineeringnas well as a usability perspective,,to make sure that we couldnmake it used practically. 
 In many digital health discussions,,people believe in and embrace the ideanthat we can simply digitize the data,,wirelessly transmit it,,send it to the cloud,,and in the cloud,,we can extract meaningfulninformation for interpretation.,And indeed, you can do all of that,,if you're not worriednabout some of the energy challenges.,Think about Jane for a moment.,She doesn't live in Palo Alto,,nor does she live in Beverly Hills.,What that means is,,we have to be mindful about her data plannand how much it would cost,for her to be sending outna continuous stream of data. 
 There's another challenge,that not everyone in the medicalnprofession is comfortable talking about.,And that is, that Janendoes not have the most trust,in the medical establishment.,She, people like her, her ancestors,nhave not had the best experiences,at the hands of doctors and the hospital,or insurance companies.,That means that we have to be mindfulnof questions of privacy.,Jane might not feel that happy,about all that datanbeing processed into the cloud.,And Jane cannot be fooled;,she reads the news.,She knows that if the federalngovernment can be hacked,,if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,,so can her doctor. 
 And so with that in mind,,we had an epiphany.,We cannot outsmartnall the hackers in the world,,but perhaps we can presentnthem a smaller target.,What if we could actually,,rather than have those algorithmsnthat do data interpretation,run in the cloud,,what if we have those algorithms runnon those small integrated circuits,embedded into those adhesives? 
 And so when we integratenthese things together,,what this means is that nownwe can think about the future,where someone like Jane can stillngo about living her normal daily life,,she can be monitored,,it can be done in a way wherenshe doesn't have to get another job,to pay her data plan,,and we can also addressnsome of her concerns about privacy. 
 So at this point,,we're feeling very good about ourselves.,We've accomplished this,,we've begun to address somenof these questions about privacy,and we feel like, pretty muchnthe chapter is closed now.,Everyone lived happily ever after, right?,Well, not so fast. 
 (Laughter) 
 One of the things we have to remember,nas I mentioned earlier,,is that Jane does not have the most trustnin the medical establishment.,We have to remember,that there are increasingnand widening health disparities,,and there's inequity in termsnof proper care management.,And so what that meansnis that this simple picture,of Jane and her data --,even with her being comfortablenbeing wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,,letting a doctor intervene if necessary --,is not the whole story. 
 So what we're beginning to do,is to think about ways to haventrusted parties serve as intermediaries,between people like Janenand her health care providers.,For example, we've begunnto partner with churches,and to think about nursesnthat are church members,,that come from that trusted community,,as patient advocates and health coachesnto people like Jane. 
 Another thing we have going for us,is that insurance companies, increasingly,,are attracted to some of these ideas.,They're increasingly realizing,that perhaps it's betternto pay one dollar now,for a wearable device and a health coach,,rather than paying 10 dollars later,,when that baby is born prematurely,and ends up in the neonatalnintensive care unit --,one of the most expensivenparts of a hospital. 
 This has been a longnlearning process for us.,This iterative process of breakingnthrough and attacking one problem,and not feeling totally comfortable,,and identifying the next problem,,has helped us go along this path,of actually trying to not onlyninnovate with this technology,but make sure it can be used for peoplenwho perhaps need it the most. 
 Another learning lessonnwe've taken from this process,that is very humbling,,is that as technology progressesnand advances at an accelerating rate,,we have to remember that human beingsnare using this technology,,and we have to be mindful,that these human beings --nthey have a face,,they have a name,and a life.,And in the case of Jane,,hopefully, two. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As a lover of human anatomy,,I'm so excited that we're finallynputting our bodies at the center of focus.,Through practicesnsuch as preventive medicine,,patient empowerment,and self-monitoring --,down to now obsessingnover every single step we take in a day.,All of this works to promote,a healthy connectionnbetween ourselves and our bodies. 
 Despite all this focusnon the healthy self,,general public knowledgenof the anatomical self is lacking.,Many people don't knownthe location of their vital organs,,or even how they function.,And that's because human anatomy,is a difficult and time-intensivensubject to learn. 
 How many of you herenmade it through anatomy?,Wow, good --,most of you are in medicine.,I, like you, spent countless hoursnmemorizing hundreds of structures.,Something no student of anatomyncould do without the help of visuals.,Because at the end of the day,,whether you remembernevery little structure or not,,these medical illustrations are whatnmakes studying anatomy so intriguing.,In looking at them,,we're actually viewingna manual of our very selves. 
 But what happens when we're done studying?,These beautiful illustrationsnare then shut back,into the pages of a medical textbook,,or an app,,referenced only when needed.,And for the public,,medical illustrationsnmay only be encountered passively,on the walls of a doctor's office. 
 From the beginnings of modern medicine,,medical illustration,,and therefore anatomy,,have existed primarily withinnthe realm of medical education.,Yet there's something fascinatingnhappening right now.,Artists are breaking anatomynout of the confines of the medical world,and are thrusting itninto the public space.,For the past nine years,nI have been cataloguing and sharing,this rise in anatomical artnwith the public --,all from my perspectivenas a medical illustrator. 
 But before I get into showing younhow artists are reclaiming anatomy today,,it's important to understandnhow art influenced anatomy in the past. 
 Now, anatomy is by itsnvery nature a visual science,,and the first anatomists to understandnthis lived during the Renaissance.,They relied on artists,to help advertise their discoveriesnto their peers in the public.,And this drive to not only teachnbut also to entertain,resulted in some of the strangestnanatomical illustrations. 
 Anatomy was caught in a strugglenbetween science, art and culture,that lasted for over 500 years.,Artists renderedndissected cadavers as alive,,posed in these humorousnanatomical stripteases.,Imagine seeing thatnin your textbooks today.,They also showed them as very much dead --,unwillingly stripped of their skin.,Disembodied limbs were oftennposed in literal still lives.,And some illustrationsneven included pop culture references.,This is Clara,,a famous rhinoceros that wasntraveling Europe in the mid-1700s,,at a time when seeing a rhinonwas an exciting rarity.,Including her in this illustrationnwas akin to celebrity sponsorship today. 
 The introduction of color,then brought a whole newndepth and clarity to anatomy,that made it stunning. 
 By the early 20th century,,the perfect balance of sciencenand art had finally been struck,with the emergencenof medical illustrators.,They created a universalnrepresentation of anatomy --,something that was neither alive nor dead,,that was free from those influencesnof artistic culture.,And this focus on no-frills accuracy,was precisely for the benefitnof medical education.,And this is what wenget to study from today. 
 But why is it that medical illustration --,both past and present --,captures our imaginations?,Now, we are innately tunedninto the beauty of the human body.,And medical illustration is still art.,Nothing can elicitnan emotional response --,from joy to complete disgust --,more than the human body.,And today,,artists armed with that emotion,,are grasping anatomynfrom the medical world,,and are reinvigorating it through artnin the most imaginative ways. 
 A perfect example of this is Spanishncontemporary artist Fernando Vicente.,He takes 19th century anatomicalnillustrations of the male body,and envelops them in a female sensuality.,The women in his paintings taunt usnto view beyond their surface anatomy,,thereby introducing a strong femininity,that was previously lacking in the historynof anatomical representation. 
 Artistry can also be seen in the repairnand recovery of the human body.,This is an X-ray of a womannwho fractured and dislocated her ankle,in a roller-skating accident.,As a tribute to her trauma,,she commissioned Montreal-basednarchitect Federico Carbajal,to construct a wire sculpturenof her damaged lower leg.,Now, notice those bright red screwsnmagnified in the sculpture.,These are the actual surgical screwsnused in reconstructing her ankle.,It's medical hardwarenthat's been repurposed as art. 
 People often ask me how I choosenthe art that I showcase online,or feature in gallery shows.,And for me it's a balancenbetween the technique,and a concept that pushes the boundariesnof anatomy as a way to know thyself,,which is why the worknof Michael Reedy struck me.,His serious figure drawingsnare often layered in elements of humor.,For instance, take a look at her face.,Notice those red marks.,Michael manifests the consumingninsecurity of a skin condition,as these maniacal cartoon monsters,annoying and out of controlnin the background.,On the mirrored figure,,he renders the full anatomy,and covers it in glitter,,making it look like candy.,By doing this,,Michael downplaysnthe common perception of anatomy,so closely tied to just disease and death. 
 Now, this next conceptnmight not make much sense,,but human anatomynis no longer limited to humans.,When you were a child,,did you ever wishnthat your toys could come to life?,Well, Jason Freenynmakes those dreams come true,with his magical toy dissections. 
 (Laughter) 
 One might think that thisnwould bring a morbid edge,to one's innocent childhood characters,,but Jason says of his dissections,,"One thing I've never seennin a child's reaction to my work is fear.",It's always wonder,,amazement,and wanting to explore.,Fear of anatomy and gutsnis a learned reaction. 
 This anatomization also extends tonpolitically and socially charged objects.,In Noah Scalin's "Anatomy of War,",we see a gun dissectednto reveal human organs.,But if you look closely,,you'll notice that it lacks a brain.,And if you keep looking,nyou might also notice,that Noah has so thoughtfullynplaced the rectum,at the business end of that gun barrel. 
 Now, this next artistnI've been following for many years,,watching him excitenthe public about anatomy.,Danny Quirk is a young artist,who paints his subjectsnin the process of self-dissection.,He bends the rules of medical illustration,by inserting a very dramaticnlight and shadow.,And this creates a 3-D illusion,that lends itself very wellnto painting directly on the human skin.,Danny makes it look as if a person'snskin has actually been removed.,And this effect --,also cool and tattoo-like --,easily transitionsninto a medical illustration.,Now Danny is currentlyntraveling the world,,teaching anatomy to the publicnvia his body paintings,,which is why it wasnso shocking to find out,that he was rejectednfrom medical illustration programs.,But he's doing just fine. 
 Then there are artists,who are extracting anatomy from bothnthe medical world and the art world,and are placing itndirectly on the streets.,London-based SHOK-1 paintsngiant X-rays of pop culture icons.,His X-rays show how culturencan come to have an anatomy of its own,,and conversely how culture can becomenpart of the anatomy of a person.,You come to admire his work,because reproducing X-rays by hand,nlet alone with spray paint,,is extremely difficult.,But then again this is a street artist,,who also happens to holdna degree in applied chemistry. 
 Nychos, an Austrian street artist,,takes the term "exploded view"nto a whole new level,,splattering human and animal dissectionsnon walls all over the world.,Influenced by comics and heavy metal,,Nychos inserts a very youthfulnand enticing energy into anatomy,that I just love. 
 Street artists believenthat art belongs to the public.,And this street anatomy is so captivating,because it is the furthest removednfrom the medical world.,It forces you to look at it,,and confront your ownnperceptions about anatomy,,whether you find it beautiful,,gross,,morbid,or awe-inspiring, like I do.,That it elicits these responses at all,is due to our intimatenand often changing relationship with it. 
 All of the artistsnthat I showed you here today,referenced medicalnillustrations for their art.,But for them,,anatomy isn't just something to memorize,,but a base from which to understandnthe human body on a meaningful level;,to depict it in ways that we can relate,,whether it be through cartoons,,body painting,or street art. 
 Anatomical art has the power,to reach far beyondnthe pages of a medical textbook,,to ignite an excitement in the public,,and reinvigorate an enthusiasmnin the medical world,,ultimately connecting our innermost selvesnwith our bodies through art. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Bruno Giussani: Commissioner,nthank you for coming to TED. 
 António Guterres: Pleasure. 
 BG: Let's start with a figure.,During 2015, almost one million refugeesnand migrants arrived in Europe,from many different countries,,of course, from Syria and Iraq,nbut also from Afghanistan,and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.,And there have been reactionsnof two different kinds:,welcoming parties and border fences.,But I want to look at it a little bit,from the short-termnand the long-term perspective.,And the first question is very simple:,Why has the movement of refugeesnspiked so fast in the last six months? 
 AG: Well, I think, basically,nwhat triggered this huge increase,was the Syrian refugee group.,There has been an increased movementninto Europe from Africa, from Asia,,but slowly growing, and all of a suddennwe had this massive increase,in the first months of this year.,Why? I think there are three reasons,,two long-term ones and the trigger.,The long-term ones,nin relation to Syrians,,is that hope is less and lessnclear for people.,I mean, they look at their own country,and they don't see much hopento go back home,,because there is no political solution,,so there is no lightnat the end of the tunnel.,Second, the living conditions,of the Syrians in the neighboringncountries have been deteriorating.,We just had research with the World Bank,,and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan,and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon,live below the national poverty lines.,Only half of the children go to school,,which means that peoplenare living very badly.,Not only are they refugees, out of home,,not only have they sufferednwhat they have suffered,,but they are living in very,nvery dramatic conditions. 
 And then the triggernwas when all of a sudden,,international aid decreased.,The World Food Programme was forced,nfor lack of resources,,to cut by 30 percent food supportnto the Syrian refugees.,They're not allowed to work,,so they are totally dependentnon international support,,and they felt, "The worldnis abandoning us.",And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.,All of a sudden, there was a rush,,and people started to movenin large numbers,and, to be absolutely honest,,if I had been in the same situation,and I would have been bravenenough to do it,,I think I would have done the same. 
 BG: But I think what surprisednmany people is it's not only sudden,,but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.,The war in Syria has beennhappening for five years.,Millions of refugees are in campsnand villages and towns around Syria.,You have yourself warnednabout the situation,and about the consequencesnof a breakdown of Libya, for example,,and yet Europe looked totally unprepared. 
 AG: Well, unprepared because divided,,and when you are divided,nyou don't want to recognize the reality.,You prefer to postpone decisions,,because you do not haventhe capacity to make them.,And the proof is that even whennthe spike occurred,,Europe remained divided,and was unable to put in placena mechanism to manage the situation.,You talk about one million people.,It looks enormous,,but the population of the European Unionnis 550 million people,,which means we are talking about onenper every [550] Europeans.,Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugeenper three Lebanese.,And Lebanon? Struggling,nof course, but it's managing.,So, the question is: is this somethingnthat could have been managed,if -- not mentioning the mostnimportant thing,,which would have beennaddressing the root causes,,but forgetting about root causes for now,,looking at the phenomenon as it is --,if Europe were able to comentogether in solidarity,to create an adequatenreception capacity of entry points?,But for that, the countries at entrynpoints need to be massively supported,,and then screening the peoplenwith security checks,and all the other mechanisms,,distributing those that are comingninto all European countries,,according to the possibilitiesnof each country.,I mean, if you look atnthe relocation program,that was approved by the Commission,nalways too little too late,,or by the Council, too little too late -- 
 BG: It's already breaking down. 
 AG: My country is supposednto receive four thousand.,Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.,So this is perfectly manageablenif it is managed,,but in the present circumstances,nthe pressure is at the point of entry,,and then, as people movenin this chaotic way through the Balkans,,then they come to Germany,nSweden, basically, and Austria.,They are the three countries that are,nin the end, receiving the refugees.,The rest of Europe is lookingnwithout doing much. 
 BG: Let me try to bring upnthree questions,,playing a bit devil's advocate.,I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.,But I think the questions are very present,in the minds of many peoplenin Europe right now,,The first, of course, is about numbers.,You say 550 million versus one millionnis not much, but realistically,,how many people can Europe take? 
 AG: Well, that is a questionnthat has no answer,,because refugees haventhe right to be protected.,And there is such a thingnas international law,,so there is no way you can say,n"I take 10,000 and that's finished.",I remind you of one thing:,in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,nI remember one minister saying,,"Turkey will be able to receivenup to 100,000 people.",Turkey has now two millionnthree-hundred thousand,or something of the sort,nif you count all refugees. 
 So I don't think it's fair to saynhow many we can take.,What it is fair to say is:nhow we can we organize ourselves,to assume our internationalnresponsibilities?,And Europe has not been able to do so,,because basically, Europe is dividednbecause there is no solidarity,in the European project.,And it's not only about refugees;nthere are many other areas.,And let's be honest, this is the momentnin which we need more Europe,instead of less Europe.,But as the public less and less believesnin European institutions,,it is also each time more difficultnto convince the public,that we need more Europento solve these problems. 
 BG: We seem to be at the point,where the numbers turn into politicalnshifts, particularly domestically.,We saw it again this weekend in France,,but we have seen it overnand over in many countries:,in Poland and in Denmarknand in Switzerland and elsewhere,,where the mood changes radicallynbecause of the numbers,,although they are not very significantnin absolute numbers.,The Prime Minister of -- 
 AG: But, if I may, on these:,I mean, what does a European see at home,in a village where there are no migrants?,What a European sees is, on television,,every single day, a few months ago,nopening the news every single day,,a crowd coming, uncontrolled,,moving from border to border,,and the images on televisionnwere of hundreds,or thousands of people moving.,And the idea is that nobodynis taking care of it --,this is happening without anynkind of management.,And so their idea was,n"They are coming to my village.",So there was this completely false ideanthat Europe was being invaded,and our way of life is going to change,nand everything will --,And the problem is that if thisnhad been properly managed,,if people had been properly received,,welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,nscreened at point of entry,,and the moved by planento different European countries,,this would not have scared people.,But, unfortunately, we havena lot of people scared,,just because Europe was not ablento do the job properly. 
 BG: But there are villages in Germany,with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.,So, what's your position?,How do you imagine these people reacting? 
 AG: If there would be a propernmanagement of the situation,and the proper distributionnof people all over Europe,,you would always haventhe percentage that I mentioned:,one per each 2,000.,It is because things are notnproperly managed,that in the end we have situations,that are totally impossible to live with,nand of course if you have a village --,in Lebanon, there are many villages,that have more Syrians than Lebanese;nLebanon has been living with that.,I'm not asking for the samento happen in Europe,,for all European villages to havenmore refugees than inhabitants.,What I am asking is for Europento do the job properly,,and to be able to organize itselfnto receive people,as other countries in the worldnwere forced to do in the past. 
 BG: So, if you look at the globalnsituation not only at Europe -- 
 (Applause) 
 BG: Yes! 
 (Applause) 
 BG: If you look at the global situation,nso, not only at Europe,,I know you can makena long list of countries,that are not really stepping up,,but I'm more interestednin the other part --,is there somebodynwho's doing the right thing? 
 AG: Well, 86 percentnof the refugees in the world,are in the developing world.,And if you look atncountries like Ethiopia --,Ethiopia has receivednmore than 600,000 refugees.,All the borders in Ethiopia are open.,And they have, as a policy,,they call the "people to people" policynthat every refugee should be received.,And they have South Sudanese,,they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.,They have all the neighbors.,They have Eritreans.,And, in general,,African countries are extremelynwelcoming of refugees coming,,and I would say that in the Middle East,and in Asia, we have seen a tendencynfor borders to be open. 
 Now we see some problemsnwith the Syrian situation,,as the Syrian situation evolvedninto also a major security crisis,,but the truth is that for a large period,,all borders in the Middle East were open.,The truth is that for Afghans,,the borders of Pakistan and Irannwere open for, at the time,,six million Afghans that came.,So I would say that even today,nthe trend in the developing world,has been for borders to be open.,The trend in the developed worldnis for these questions to become,more and more complex,,especially when there is,nin the public opinion,,a mixture of discussions between refugeenprotections on one side,and security questions -- in my opinion,nmisinterpreted -- on the other side. 
 BG: We'll come back to that too,,but you mentioned the cuttingnof funding and the vouchers,from the World Food Programme.,That reflects the general underfundingnof the organizations,working on these issues.,Now that the world seems to have woken up,,are you getting more fundingnand more support,,or it's still the same? 
 AG: We are getting more support.,I would say that we are comingnclose to the levels of last year.,We were much worse during the summer.,But that is clearly insufficientnto address the needs of the people,and address the needs of the countries,that are supporting the people.,And here we have a basic reviewnof the criteria, the objectives,,the priorities of developmentncooperation that is required. 
 For instance, Lebanon and Jordannare middle-income countries.,Because they are middle-income countries,,they cannot receive soft loansnor grants from the World Bank.,Now, today this doesn't make any sense,,because they are providingna global public good.,They have millions of refugees there,,and to be honest, they are pillarsnof stability in the region,,with all the difficulties they face,,and the first line of defensenof our collective security.,So it doesn't make sense,that these countriesnare not a first priority,in development cooperation policies.,And they are not.,And not only do the refugees livenin very dramatic circumstances,inside those countries,,but the local communitiesnthemselves are suffering,,because salaries went down,,because there are more unemployed,,because prices and rents went up.,And, of course, if you looknat today's situation,of the indicators in these countries,,it is clear that, especiallyntheir poor groups of the population,,are living worse and worsenbecause of the crisis they are facing. 
 BG: Who should be providing this support?,Country by country, internationalnorganizations, the European Union?,Who should be coming up with this support? 
 AG: We need to join all efforts.,It's clear that bilateralncooperation is essential.,It's clear that multilateralncooperation is essential.,It's clear that international financialninstitutions should have flexibility,in order to be able to investnmore massively,in support to these countries.,We need to combine all the instrumentsnand to understand that today,,in protracted situations,nat a certain moment,,that it doesn't make sense anymorento make a distinction,between humanitarian aidnand development aid,or development processes.,Because you are talkingnabout children in school,,you are talking about health,,you are talking about infrastructurenthat is overcrowded.,You are talking about thingsnthat require a long-term perspective,,a development perspective,and not only an emergencynhumanitarian aid perspective. 
 BG: I would like your comment on something,that was in newspapers this morning.,It is a statement madenby the current front-runner,for the Republican nominationnfor US President, Donald Trump.,Yesterday, he said this. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, listen to this. It's interesting.,I quote: "I am calling for a totalnand complete shutdown,of Muslims entering the US,,until our country's representativesncan figure out what's going on.",How do you react to that? 
 AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.,We have seen several peoplenaround the world,with political responsibilitynsaying, for instance,,that Muslims refugeesnshould not be received.,And the reason why they say this,is because they thinknthat by doing or saying this,,they are protectingnthe security of their countries.,Now, I've been in government.,I am very keen on the need for governments,to protect the security of their countries,and their people.,But if you say, like that,,in the US or in any European country,,"We are going to close our doorsnto Muslim refugees,",what you are sayingnis the best possible help,for the propagandanof terrorist organizations.,Because what you are saying -- 
 (Applause) 
 What you are saying will be heardnby all the Muslims in your own country,,and it will pave the waynfor the recruitment,and the mechanisms that,nthrough technology,,Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,nand all those other groups,are today penetrating in our societies.,And it's just telling them,n"You are right, we are against you.",So obviously, this is creatingnin societies that are all multiethnic,,multi-religious, multicultural,,this is creating a situationnin which, really,,it is much easier for the propagandanof these terrorist organizations,to be effective in recruitingnpeople for terror acts,within the countries where these kindsnof sentences are expressed. 
 BG: Have the recent attacks in Parisnand the reactions to them,made your job more difficult? 
 AG: Undoubtedly. 
 BG: In what sense? 
 AG: In the sense that, I mean,nfor many people the first reaction,in relation to these kinds of terroristnattacks is: close all borders --,not understanding that the terroristnproblem in Europe is largely homegrown.,We have thousands and thousandsnof European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,,so this is not something that you solvenby just not allowing Syrians to come in.,And I must say, I am convinced,that the passport that appeared,,I believe, was putnby the person who has blown -- 
 BG: -- himself up, yeah. 
 AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,,because part of the strategiesnof Daesh is against refugees,,because they see refugees as peoplenthat should be with the caliphate,and are fleeing to the crusaders.,And I think that is part of Daesh'snstrategy to make Europe react,,closing its doors to Muslim refugees,and having an hostilityntowards Muslims inside Europe,,exactly to facilitate Daesh's work. 
 And my deep belief is thatnit was not the refugee movement,that triggered terrorism.,I think, as I said,,essentially terrorism in Europenis today a homegrown movement,in relation to the global situationnthat we are facing,,and what we need is exactlynto prove these groups wrong,,by welcoming and integrating effectively,those that are comingnfrom that part of the world. 
 And another thing that I believenis that to a large extent,,what we are today paying for in Europe,is the failures of integration models,that didn't work in the '60s,nin the '70s, in the '80s,,in relation to big migration flowsnthat took place at that time,and generated what is todaynin many of the people, for instance,,of the second generation of communities,,a situation of feeling marginalized,,having no jobs,,having improper education,,living in some of the neighborhoodsnthat are not adequately provided,by public infrastructure.,And this kind of uneasiness,nsometimes even anger,,that exists in this second generation,is largely due to the failurenof integration policies,,to the failure of what should have beenna much stronger investment,in creating the conditions for peoplento live together and respect each other.,For me it is clear. 
 (Applause) 
 For me it is clear that all societiesnwill be multiethnic, multicultural,,multi-religious in the future.,To try to avoid it is,nin my opinion, impossible.,And for me it's a good thingnthat they will be like that,,but I also recognize that,nfor that to work properly,,you need a huge investment,in the social cohesionnof your own societies.,And Europe, to a large extent,nfailed in that investment,in the past few decades. 
 BG: Question: You are stepping downnfrom your job at the end of the year,,after 10 years.,If you look back at 2005,,when you entered that officenfor the first time, what do you see? 
 AG: Well, look:,In 2005, we were helpingnone million people go back home,in safety and dignity,nbecause conflicts had ended.,Last year, we helped 124,000.,In 2005, we had about 38 million peoplendisplaced by conflict in the world.,Today, we have more than 60 million.,At that time, we had had, recently,,some conflicts that were solved.,Now, we see a multiplicationnof new conflicts,and the old conflicts never died:,Afghanistan, Somalia,nDemocratic Republic of Congo.,It is clear that the world todaynis much more dangerous than it was.,It is clear that the capacitynof the international community,to prevent conflictsnand to timely solve them,,is, unfortunately, much worsenthan what it was 10 years ago.,There are no clearnpower relations in the world,,no global governance mechanisms that work,,which means that we live in a situation,where impunity and unpredictabilityntend to prevail, and that means,that more and more people suffer,,namely those that arendisplaced by conflicts. 
 BG: It's a tradition in American politics,that when a President leavesnthe Oval Office for the last time,,he leaves a handwritten notenon the desk for his successor,that walks in a couple of hours later.,If you had to write such a notento your successor, Filippo Grandi,,what would you write? 
 AG: Well, I don't thinknI would write any message.,You know, one of the terrible thingsnwhen one leaves an office,is to try to become the backseat driver,,always telling the new one what to do.,So that, I will not do.,If I had to say something to him,,it would be, "Be yourself,nand do your best." 
 BG: Commissioner, thank younfor the job you do.,Thank you for coming to TED. 
 (Applause)This is Pleurobot.,Pleurobot is a robot that we designednto closely mimic a salamander species,called Pleurodeles waltl.,Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,,and as you'll see later, it can also swim. 
 So you might ask,nwhy did we design this robot?,And in fact, this robot has been designednas a scientific tool for neuroscience.,Indeed, we designed itntogether with neurobiologists,to understand how animals move,,and especially how the spinal cordncontrols locomotion.,But the more I work in biorobotics,,the more I'm really impressednby animal locomotion.,If you think of a dolphin swimmingnor a cat running or jumping around,,or even us as humans,,when you go jogging or play tennis,,we do amazing things.,And in fact, our nervous system solvesna very, very complex control problem.,It has to coordinatenmore or less 200 muscles perfectly,,because if the coordination is bad,nwe fall over or we do bad locomotion.,And my goal is to understandnhow this works. 
 There are four main componentsnbehind animal locomotion.,The first component is just the body,,and in fact we should never underestimate,to what extent the biomechanicsnalready simplify locomotion in animals.,Then you have the spinal cord,,and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,,multiple reflexes that createna sensorimotor coordination loop,between neural activity in the spinal cordnand mechanical activity.,A third componentnare central pattern generators.,These are very interesting circuitsnin the spinal cord of vertebrate animals,that can generate, by themselves,,very coordinatednrhythmic patterns of activity,while receivingnonly very simple input signals.,And these input signals,coming from descending modulationnfrom higher parts of the brain,,like the motor cortex,nthe cerebellum, the basal ganglia,,will all modulate activitynof the spinal cord,while we do locomotion.,But what's interesting is to what extentnjust a low-level component,,the spinal cord, together with the body,,already solve a big partnof the locomotion problem.,You probably know it by the factnthat you can cut the head off a chicken,,it can still run for a while,,showing that just the lower part,nspinal cord and body,,already solve a big part of locomotion. 
 Now, understanding how this worksnis very complex,,because first of all,,recording activity in the spinal cordnis very difficult.,It's much easier to implant electrodesnin the motor cortex,than in the spinal cord,nbecause it's protected by the vertebrae.,Especially in humans, very hard to do.,A second difficulty is that locomotionnis really due to a very complex,and very dynamic interactionnbetween these four components.,So it's very hard to find outnwhat's the role of each over time.,This is where biorobots like Pleurobotnand mathematical models,can really help. 
 So what's biorobotics?,Biorobotics is a very active fieldnof research in robotics,where people want tontake inspiration from animals,to make robots to go outdoors,,like service robotsnor search and rescue robots,or field robots.,And the big goal herenis to take inspiration from animals,to make robots that can handlencomplex terrain --,stairs, mountains, forests,,places where robotsnstill have difficulties,and where animalsncan do a much better job.,The robot can be a wonderfulnscientific tool as well.,There are some very nice projectsnwhere robots are used,,like a scientific tool for neuroscience,nfor biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.,And this is exactlynthe purpose of Pleurobot.,So what we do in my labnis to collaborate with neurobiologists,like Jean-Marie Cabelguen,na neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,,and we want to make spinal cord modelsnand validate them on robots.,And here we want to start simple. 
 So it's good to start with simple animals,like lampreys, which arenvery primitive fish,,and then graduallyngo toward more complex locomotion,,like in salamanders,,but also in cats and in humans,,in mammals.,And here, a robot becomesnan interesting tool,to validate our models.,And in fact, for me, Pleurobotnis a kind of dream becoming true.,Like, more or less 20 years agonI was already working on a computer,making simulations of lampreynand salamander locomotion,during my PhD.,But I always knew that my simulationsnwere just approximations.,Like, simulating the physics in waternor with mud or with complex ground,,it's very hard to simulate thatnproperly on a computer.,Why not have a real robotnand real physics?,So among all these animals,none of my favorites is the salamander.,You might ask why,nand it's because as an amphibian,,it's a really key animalnfrom an evolutionary point of view.,It makes a wonderful linknbetween swimming,,as you find it in eels or fish,,and quadruped locomotion,nas you see in mammals, in cats and humans.,And in fact, the modern salamander,is very close to the firstnterrestrial vertebrate,,so it's almost a living fossil,,which gives us access to our ancestor,,the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods. 
 So the salamander swims,by doing what's callednan anguilliform swimming gait,,so they propagate a nice traveling wavenof muscle activity from head to tail.,And if you placenthe salamander on the ground,,it switches to what's calledna walking trot gait.,In this case, you have nicenperiodic activation of the limbs,which are very nicely coordinated,with this standing wavenundulation of the body,,and that's exactly the gaitnthat you are seeing here on Pleurobot.,Now, one thing which is very surprisingnand fascinating in fact,is the fact that all this can be generatednjust by the spinal cord and the body.,So if you takena decerebrated salamander --,it's not so nicenbut you remove the head --,and if you electricallynstimulate the spinal cord,,at low level of stimulationnthis will induce a walking-like gait.,If you stimulate a bit more,nthe gait accelerates.,And at some point, there's a threshold,,and automatically,nthe animal switches to swimming.,This is amazing.,Just changing the global drive,,as if you are pressing the gas pedal,of descending modulationnto your spinal cord,,makes a complete switchnbetween two very different gaits.,And in fact, the samenhas been observed in cats.,If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,,you can switch betweennwalk, trot and gallop.,Or in birds, you can make a birdnswitch between walking,,at a low level of stimulation,,and flapping its wingsnat high-level stimulation.,And this really shows that the spinal cord,is a very sophisticatednlocomotion controller. 
 So we studied salamander locomotionnin more detail,,and we had in fact accessnto a very nice X-ray video machine,from Professor Martin Fischernin Jena University in Germany.,And thanks to that,nyou really have an amazing machine,to record all the bone motionnin great detail.,That's what we did.,So we basically figured outnwhich bones are important for us,and collected their motion in 3D.,And what we did is collectna whole database of motions,,both on ground and in water,,to really collect a whole databasenof motor behaviors,that a real animal can do.,And then our job as roboticistsnwas to replicate that in our robot.,So we did a whole optimization processnto find out the right structure,,where to place the motors,nhow to connect them together,,to be able to replaynthese motions as well as possible.,And this is how Pleurobot came to life. 
 So let's look at how closenit is to the real animal.,So what you see herenis almost a direct comparison,between the walkingnof the real animal and the Pleurobot.,You can see that we havenalmost a one-to-one exact replay,of the walking gait.,If you go backwards and slowly,nyou see it even better.,But even better, we can do swimming.,So for that we have a dry suitnthat we put all over the robot -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and then we can go in waternand start replaying the swimming gaits.,And here, we were very happy,nbecause this is difficult to do.,The physics of interaction are complex.,Our robot is much biggernthan a small animal,,so we had to do what's calledndynamic scaling of the frequencies,to make sure we hadnthe same interaction physics.,But you see at the end,nwe have a very close match,,and we were very, very happy with this.,So let's go to the spinal cord.,So here what we didnwith Jean-Marie Cabelguen,is model the spinal cord circuits.,And what's interestingnis that the salamander,has kept a very primitive circuit,,which is very similarnto the one we find in the lamprey,,this primitive eel-like fish,,and it looks like during evolution,,new neural oscillatorsnhave been added to control the limbs,,to do the leg locomotion.,And we know wherenthese neural oscillators are,but what we did was to makena mathematical model,to see how they should be coupled,to allow this transitionnbetween the two very different gaits.,And we tested that on board of a robot. 
 And this is how it looks.,So what you see herenis a previous version of Pleurobot,that's completely controllednby our spinal cord model,programmed on board of the robot.,And the only thing we do,is send to the robotnthrough a remote control,the two descending signalsnit normally should receive,from the upper part of the brain.,And what's interesting is,nby playing with these signals,,we can completely controlnspeed, heading and type of gait.,For instance,,when we stimulate at a low level,nwe have the walking gait,,and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,,very rapidly it switchesnto the swimming gait.,And finally, we can alsondo turning very nicely,by just stimulating more one sidenof the spinal cord than the other.,And I think it's really beautiful,how nature has distributed control,to really give a lot of responsibilitynto the spinal cord,so that the upper part of the brainndoesn't need to worry about every muscle.,It just has to worrynabout this high-level modulation,,and it's really the job of the spinal cordnto coordinate all the muscles. 
 So now let's go to cat locomotionnand the importance of biomechanics.,So this is another project,where we studied cat biomechanics,,and we wanted to see how muchnthe morphology helps locomotion.,And we found three importantncriteria in the properties,,basically, of the limbs.,The first one is that a cat limb,more or less looksnlike a pantograph-like structure.,So a pantograph is a mechanical structure,which keeps the upper segmentnand the lower segments always parallel.,So a simple geometrical systemnthat kind of coordinates a bit,the internal movement of the segments.,A second property of cat limbsnis that they are very lightweight.,Most of the muscles are in the trunk,,which is a good idea,nbecause then the limbs have low inertia,and can be moved very rapidly.,The last final important property is thisnvery elastic behavior of the cat limb,,so to handle impacts and forces.,And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub. 
 So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.,So this is Peter Eckert,nwho does his PhD on this robot,,and as you see, it's a cute little robot.,It looks a bit like a toy,,but it was really usednas a scientific tool,to investigate these propertiesnof the legs of the cat.,So you see, it's very compliant,nvery lightweight,,and also very elastic,,so you can easily press it downnand it will not break.,It will just jump, in fact.,And this very elastic propertynis also very important.,And you also see a bit these properties,of these three segmentsnof the leg as pantograph. 
 Now, what's interestingnis that this quite dynamic gait,is obtained purely in open loop,,meaning no sensors,nno complex feedback loops.,And that's interesting, because it means,that just the mechanicsnalready stabilized this quite rapid gait,,and that really good mechanicsnalready basically simplify locomotion.,To the extent that we can evenndisturb a bit locomotion,,as you will see in the next video,,where we can for instance do some exercisenwhere we have the robot go down a step,,and the robot will not fall over,,which was a surprise for us.,This is a small perturbation.,I was expecting the robotnto immediately fall over,,because there are no sensors,nno fast feedback loop.,But no, just the mechanicsnstabilized the gait,,and the robot doesn't fall over.,Obviously, if you make the step bigger,nand if you have obstacles,,you need the full control loopsnand reflexes and everything.,But what's important herenis that just for small perturbation,,the mechanics are right.,And I think this isna very important message,from biomechanics and roboticsnto neuroscience,,saying don't underestimate to what extentnthe body already helps locomotion. 
 Now, how does this relatento human locomotion?,Clearly, human locomotion is more complexnthan cat and salamander locomotion,,but at the same time, the nervous systemnof humans is very similar,to that of other vertebrates.,And especially the spinal cord,is also the key controllernfor locomotion in humans.,That's why, if there's a lesionnof the spinal cord,,this has dramatic effects.,The person can becomenparaplegic or tetraplegic.,This is because the brainnloses this communication,with the spinal cord.,Especially, it losesnthis descending modulation,to initiate and modulate locomotion.,So a big goal of neuroprosthetics,is to be able to reactivatenthat communication,using electrical or chemical stimulations.,And there are several teamsnin the world that do exactly that,,especially at EPFL.,My colleagues Grégoire Courtinenand Silvestro Micera,,with whom I collaborate. 
 But to do this properly,nit's very important to understand,how the spinal cord works,,how it interacts with the body,,and how the brainncommunicates with the spinal cord.,This is where the robotsnand models that I've presented today,will hopefully play a key role,towards these very important goals. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seennin your lab other robots,that do things like swim in pollution,and measure the pollution while they swim.,But for this one,,you mentioned in your talk,nlike a side project,,search and rescue,,and it does have a camera on its nose. 
 Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --,We have some spin-off projects,where we would like to use the robotsnto do search and rescue inspection,,so this robot is now seeing you.,And the big dream is to,nif you have a difficult situation,like a collapsed buildingnor a building that is flooded,,and this is very dangerousnfor a rescue team or even rescue dogs,,why not send in a robotnthat can crawl around, swim, walk,,with a camera onboardnto do inspection and identify survivors,and possibly createna communication link with the survivor. 
 BG: Of course, assuming the survivorsndon't get scared by the shape of this. 
 AI: Yeah, we should probablynchange the appearance quite a bit,,because here I guess a survivornmight die of a heart attack,just of being worriednthat this would feed on you.,But by changing the appearancenand it making it more robust,,I'm sure we can makena good tool out of it. 
 BG: Thank you very much.nThank you and your team.Food crisis.,It's in the news every day.,But what is it? 
 Some places in the worldnit's too little food,,maybe too much.,Other places, GMO is saving the world.,Maybe GMO is the problem?,Too much agricultural runoffncreating bad oceans, toxic oceans,,attenuation of nutrition.,They go on and on.,And I find the current climatenof this discussion,incredibly disempowering.,So how do we bring thatnto something that we understand? 
 How is this apple food crisis?,You've all eaten an applenin the last week, I'm sure.,How old do you think it wasnfrom when it was picked?,Two weeks?,Two months?,Eleven months --,the average age of an applenin a grocery store in the United States.,And I don't expect itnto be much different in Europe,or anywhere else in the world.,We pick them,,we put them in cold storage,,we gas the cold storage --,there's actually documented proof,of workers trying to goninto these environments,to retrieve an apple,,and dying,,because the atmosphere,that they slow down the processnof the apple with is also toxic to humans. 
 How is it that none of you knew this?,Why didn't I know this?,Ninety percent of the qualitynof that apple --,all of the antioxidants -- are gonenby the time we get it.,It's basically a little ball of sugar.,How did we get so information poor,and how can we do better? 
 I think what's missing is a platform.,I know platforms -- I know computers,,they put me on the Internetnwhen I was young.,I did very weird things -- 
 (Laughter) 
 on this platform.,But I met people,nand I could express myself. 
 How do you express yourself in food?,If we had a platform,,we might feel empowerednto question: What if?,For me, I questioned:,What if climate was democratic?,So, this is a map of climate in the world.,The most productive areas in green,nthe least productive in red.,They shift and they change,,and Californian farmersnnow become Mexican farmers.,China picks up land in Brazilnto grow better food,,and we're a slave to climate.,What if each country hadnits own productive climate?,What would that change about how we live?,What would that changenabout quality of life and nutrition? 
 The last generation's problemnwas, we need more food,and we need it cheap.,Welcome to your global farm.,We built a huge analog farm.,All these traces --,these are cars, planes,ntrains and automobiles.,It's a miracle that we feednseven billion people,with just a few of us involvednin the production of food. 
 What if ...,we built a digital farm?,A digital world farm.,What if you could take this apple,,digitize it somehow,,send it through particles in the air,and reconstitute it on the other side?,What if? 
 Going through some of these quotes,,you know, they inspire me to do what I do. 
 First one: 
 ["Japanese farming has no youth,nno water, no land and no future."] 
 That's what I landed to the daynthat I went to Minamisanriku,,one stop south of Fukushima,,after the disaster.,The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,,the land is contaminated,,they already import 70 percentnof their own food.,But it's not unique to Japan.,Two percent of the American populationnis involved in farming.,What good answer comesnfrom two percent of any population?,As we go around the world,,50 percent of the Africannpopulation is under 18.,Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.,Farming is hard.,The life of a small-shareholdernfarmer is miserable.,They go into the city.,In India:,farmers' families not being ablento have basic access to utilities,,more farmer suicides this yearnand the previous 10 before that.,It's uncomfortable to talk about.,Where are they going?,Into the city.,No young people, and everyone's headed in.,So how do we build this platformnthat inspires the youth? 
 Welcome to the new tractor.,This is my combine.,A number of years ago now,,I went to Bed Bath and Beyondnand Home Depot,and I started hacking.,And I built silly things,and I made plants dance,and I attached them to my computer,and I killed them all --,a lot. 
 (Laughter) 
 I eventually got them to survive.,And I created one of the mostnintimate relationships,I've ever had in my life,,because I was learningnthe language of plants.,I wanted to make it bigger.,They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!,Here's an old electronics roomnthat nobody wants.,What can you do?" 
 With my team, we built a farmninside of the media lab,,a place historically knownnnot for anything about biology,but everything about digital life.,Inside of these 60 square feet,,we produced enough food to feednabout 300 people once a month --,not a lot of food.,And there's a lot of interestingntechnology in there.,But the most interesting thing?,Beautiful, white roots,,deep, green colors,and a monthly harvest.,Is this a new cafeteria?,Is this a new retail experience?,Is this a new grocery store?,I can tell you one thing for sure:,this is the first time,anybody in the media labnripped the roots off of anything. 
 (Laughter) 
 We get our salad in bags;,there's nothing wrong with that.,But what happens,when you have an image-basednprocessing expert,,a data scientist,,a roboticist,,ripping roots off and thinking,,"Huh. I know something about --,I could make this happen, I want to try." 
 In that process we wouldnbring the plants out,and we would take some back to the lab,,because if you grew it,nyou don't throw it away;,it's kind of precious to you.,I have this weird tongue now,,because I'm afraid to let anybody eatnanything until I've eaten it first,,because I want it to be good.,So I eat lettuce every day,and I can tell the pHnof a lettuce within .1. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no,nno, you can't eat it today." 
 (Applause) 
 This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.,It was hyper sweetnbecause the plant had been stressed,and it created a chemical reactionnin the plant to protect itself:,"I'm not going to die!",And the plants not-going-to-die,ntaste sweet to me.,Technologists falling backwardsninto plant physiology. 
 So we thought other peoplenneeded to be able to try this.,We want to see what people can create,,so we conceived of a labnthat could be shipped anywhere.,And then we built it. 
 So on the facadenof the media lab is my lab,,that has about 30 pointsnof sensing per plant.,If you know about the genome or genetics,,this is the phenome, right?,The phenomena.,When you say, "I likenthe strawberries from Mexico,",you really like the strawberriesnfrom the climate,that produced the expressionnthat you like.,So if you're coding climate --,this much CO2, this much O2 createsna recipe -- you're coding,the expression of that plant,nthe nutrition of that plant,,the size of that plant, the shape,nthe color, the texture.,We need data,,so we put a bunch of sensors in there,to tell us what's going on. 
 If you think of your houseplants,,and you look at your houseplant,and you're super sad, because you're like,,"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Farmers develop the most beautifulnfortune-telling eyes,by the time they're in theirnlate 60s and 70s.,They can tell you when younsee that plant dying,that it's a nitrogen deficiency,na calcium deficiency,or it needs more humidity.,Those beautiful eyesnare not being passed down. 
 These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.,We trend those data points over time.,We correlate those data pointsnto individual plants.,These are all the broccolinin my lab that day, by IP address. 
 (Laughter) 
 We have IP-addressable broccoli. 
 (Applause) 
 So if that's not weird enough,,you can click onenand you get a plant profile.,And what this tells younis downloadable progress on that plant,,but not like you'd think,,it's not just when it's ready.,When does it achieventhe nutrition that I need?,When does it achieventhe taste that I desire?,Is it getting too much water?,Is it getting too much sun?,Alerts.,It can talk to me, it's conversant,,we have a language. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I think of that as the first usernon the plant Facebook, right?,That's a plant profile,and that plant will start making friends. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I mean it -- it will makenfriends with other plants,that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,,less potassium.,We're going to learn about a complexity,that we can only guess at now.,And they may not friend us back --nI don't know, they might friend us back,,it depends on how we act. 
 So this is my lab now.,It's a little bit more systematized,,my background is designing data centersnin hospitals of all things,,so I know a little bit about creatingna controlled environment. 
 And so --,inside of this environment,,we're experimentingnwith all kinds of things.,This process, aeroponics, was developednby NASA for Mir Space Station,for reducing the amount of waternthey send into space.,What it really does is give the plantnexactly what it wants:,water, minerals and oxygen.,Roots are not that complicated,,so when you give them that,nyou get this amazing expression.,It's like the plant has two hearts.,And because it has two hearts,,it grows four or five times faster.,It's a perfect world.,We've gone a long way into technologynand seed for an adverse world,and we're going to continue to do that,,but we're going to have a new tool, too,,which is perfect world. 
 So we've grown all kinds of things.,These tomatoes hadn't beennin commercial production for 150 years.,Do you know that we havenrare and ancient seed banks?,Banks of seed.,It's amazing.,They have germplasm alivenand things that you've never eaten.,I am the only person in this roomnthat's eaten that kind of tomato.,Problem is it was a sauce tomatonand we don't know how to cook,,so we ate a sauce tomato,nwhich is not that great.,But we've done things with protein --nwe've grown all kinds of things.,We've grown humans -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Well maybe you could, but we didn't. 
 But what we realized is,,the tool was too big,nit was too expensive.,I was starting to put themnaround the world,and they were about 100,000 dollars.,Finding somebody with 100 grandnin their back pocket isn't easy,,so we wanted to make a small one. 
 This project was actuallynone of my student's --,mechanical engineeringnundergraduate, Camille.,So Camille and I and my team,,we iterated all summer,,how to make it cheaper,nhow to make it work better,,how to make it so othernpeople can make it.,Then we dropped them off in schools,nseventh through eleventh grade.,And if you want to be humbled,ntry to teach a kid something. 
 So I went into this school and I said,,"Set it to 65 percent humidity." 
 The seventh gradernsaid, "What's humidity?" 
 And I said, "Oh, it's water in air." 
 He said, "There's no waternin air, you're an idiot." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.,Actually -- don't trust me, right?,Set it to 100.,He sets it to 100 and what happens?,It starts to condense, make a fognand eventually drip. 
 And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.,Why didn't you just tell me that?" 
 (Laughter) 
 We've created an interfacenfor this that's much like a game.,They have a 3D environment,,they can log into it anywhere in the world,on their smartphone, on their tablet.,They have different parts of the bots --nthe physical, the sensors.,They select recipes that havenbeen created by other kids,anywhere in the world.,They select and activate that recipe,nthey plant a seedling.,While it's growing, they make changes.,They're like, "Why does a plantnneed CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?,It kills people.",Crank up CO2, plant dies.,Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.,Harvest plant,,and you've created a new digital recipe. 
 It's an iterative design and development,and exploration process.,They can download, then,,all of the data about that new plantnthat they developed,or the new digital recipenand what did it do --,was it better or was it worse?,Imagine these as little coresnof processing.,We're going to learn so much. 
 Here's one of the food computers,nas we call them,,in a school in three weeks' time.,This is three weeks of growth.,But more importantly,,it was the first time that this kidnever thought he could be a farmer --,or that he would want to be a farmer. 
 So, we've open-sourced all of this.,It's all online; go home, try to buildnyour first food computer.,It's going to be difficult --nI'm just telling you.,We're in the beginning,nbut it's all there.,It's very important to menthat this is easily accessible.,We're going to keep making it more so. 
 These are farmers,,electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,,environmental engineer,ncomputer scientist,,plant scientist,neconomist, urban planners.,On one platform, doingnwhat they're good at.,But we got a little too big. 
 This is my new facilitynthat I'm just starting.,This warehouse could be anywhere.,That's why I chose it.,And inside of this warehouse,we're going to build somethingnkind of like this.,These exist right now.,Take a look at it.,These exist, too.,One grows greens,,one grows Ebola vaccine.,Pretty amazing that plantsnand this DARPA Grand Challenge winner,is one of the reasonsnwe're getting ahead of Ebola.,The plants are producingnthe protein that's Ebola resistant.,So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,,all they way down to lettuce. 
 But these two things look nothing alike,,and that's where I am with my field.,Everything is different.,We're in that weird "We're alright" stage,and it's like, "Here's my black box --","No, buy mine.","No, no, no -- I've got intellectualnproperty that's totally valuable.,Don't buy his, buy mine." 
 And the reality is,nwe're just at the beginning,,in a time when society is shifting, too.,When we ask for more, cheaper food,,we're now asking for better,nenvironmentally friendly food.,And when you have McDonald's advertisingnwhat's in the Chicken McNugget,,the most mysteriousnfood item of all time --,they are now basingntheir marketing plan on that --,everything is changing. 
 So into the world now.,Personal food computers,,food servers,and food data centers,run on the open phenome.,Think open genome, but we're goingnto put little climate recipes,,like Wikipedia,,that you can pull down, actuate and grow. 
 What does this look like in a world?,You remember the worldnconnected by strings?,We start having beacons.,We start sending information about food,,rather than sending food.,This is not just my fantasy,,this is where we're already deploying.,Food computers, food servers,,soon-to-be food data centers,,connecting people togethernto share information. 
 The future of food is not about fightingnover what's wrong with this.,We know what's wrong with this.,The future of food is about networkingnthe next one billion farmers,and empowering them with a platform,to ask and answer the question,,"What if?" 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Our ability to createnand sustain economic growth,is the defining challenge of our time. 
 Of course there are other challenges --,health care, disease burdensnand pandemics,,environmental challenges,and, of course, radicalized terrorism.,However,,to the extent that we can actuallynsolve the economic growth challenge,,it will take us a long way,to solving the challengesnthat I've just elucidated. 
 More importantly,,unless and until we solve economic growth,and create sustainable,nlong-term economic growth,,we'll be unable to address,the seemingly intractable challengesnthat continue to pervade the globe today,,whether it's health care,neducation or economic development. 
 The fundamental question is this:,How are we going to create economic growth,in advanced and developed economiesnlike the United States and across Europe,at a time when they continue to struggle,to create economic growthnafter the financial crisis? 
 They continue to underperform,and to see an erosion in the threenkey drivers of economic growth:,capital, labor and productivity.,In particular,,these developed economiesncontinue to see debts and deficits,,the decline and erosionnof both the quality and quantity of labor,and they also see productivity stalling. 
 In a similar vein,,how are we going to createneconomic growth in the emerging markets,,where 90 percentnof the world's population lives,and where, on average,,70 percent of the populationnis under the age of 25?,In these countries,,it is essential that they grownat a minimum of seven percent a year,in order to put a dent in poverty,and to double per capita incomesnin one generation.,And yet today,,the largest emerging economies --,countries with at leastn50 million people --,continue to struggle to reachnthat seven percent magic mark.,Worse than that,,countries like India, Russia,nSouth Africa, Brazil and even China,are falling belownthat seven percent number,and, in many cases, actually regressing. 
 Economic growth matters.,With economic growth,,countries and societiesnenter into a virtuous cycle,of upward mobility, opportunitynand improved living standards.,Without growth,ncountries contract and atrophy,,not just in the annalsnof economic statistics,but also in the meaning of lifenand how lives are lived.,Economic growth mattersnpowerfully for the individual.,If growth wanes,,the risk to human progress,and the risk of politicalnand social instability rises,,and societies become dimmer,ncoarser and smaller. 
 The context matters.,And countries in emerging markets,do not need to grow at the samenrates as developed countries. 
 Now, I know some of you in this roomnfind this to be a risky proposition.,There are some people here,who will turn aroundnand be quite disillusioned,by what's happened around the world,and basically ascribe thatnto economic growth.,You worry about thenoverpopulation of the planet.,And looking at the UN'snrecent statistics and projections,that the world will haven11 billion people on the planet,before it plateaus in 2100,,you're concerned about what that doesnto natural resources --,arable land, potable water,nenergy and minerals.,You are also concerned aboutnthe degradation of the environment.,And you worry about how man,,embodied in the corporate globalist,,has become greedy and corrupt. 
 But I'm here to tell you todaynthat economic growth,has been the backbonenof changes in living standards,of millions of people around the world.,And more importantly,,it's not just economic growthnthat has been driven by capitalism. 
 The definition of capitalism,nvery simply put,,is that the factors of production,,such as trade and industry,ncapital and labor,,are left in the handsnof the private sector and not the state. 
 It's really essential herenthat we understand,that fundamentally the critiquenis not for economic growth per se,but what has happened to capitalism.,And to the extent that we need to createneconomic growth over the long term,,we're going to have to pursue itnwith a better form of economic stance. 
 Economic growth needs capitalism,,but it needs it to work properly.,And as I mentioned a moment ago,,the core of the capitalist systemnhas been defined by private actors.,And even this, however,nis a very simplistic dichotomy.,Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.,When in practical experience,,capitalism is much more of a spectrum.,And we have countries such as China,,which have practicednmore state capitalism,,and we have countriesnlike the Unites States,which are more market capitalist. 
 Our efforts to critiquenthe capitalist system, however,,have tended to focusnon countries like China,that are in factnnot blatantly market capitalism. 
 However, there isna real reason and real concern,for us to now focus our attentionsnon purer forms of capitalism,,particularly those embodiednby the United States.,This is really important,because this type of capitalism,has increasinglynbeen afforded the critique,that it is now fostering corruption,and, worse still,,it's increasing income inequality --,the idea that the few are benefitingnat the expense of the many. 
 The two really critical questionsnthat we need to address,is how can we fix capitalism,so that it can help create economic growth,but at the same timencan help to address social ills. 
 In order to think about that framing,nwe have to ask ourselves,,how does capitalism work today?,Very simplistically,,capitalism is set on the basisnof an individual utility maximizer --,a selfish individualnwho goes after what he or she wants.,And only after they'venmaximized their utility,do they then decide it's important,to provide supportnto other social contracts.,Of course, in this systemngovernments do tax,,and they use part of their revenuesnto fund social programs,,recognizing that government's rolenis not just regulation,but also to be arbiter of social goods.,But nevertheless,,this framework --,this two-stage framework --,is the basis from which we must now start,to think about how we cannimprove the capitalist model. 
 I would argue that there arentwo sides to this challenge.,First of all,,we can draw on the right-wing policies,to see what could be beneficial for us,to think about hownwe can improve capitalism. 
 In particular,,right-leaning policies,have tended to focus on thingsnlike conditional transfers,,where we pay and reward peoplenfor doing the things,that we actually thinkncan help enhance economic growth.,For example,,sending children to school,,parents could earn money for that,,or getting their childrenninoculated or immunized,,parents could get paid for doing that. 
 Now, quite apart from the debate,on whether or notnwe should be paying people,to do what we think they should do anyway,,the fact of the matternis that pay for performance,has actually yielded some positive results,in places like Mexico,,in Brazil,and also in pilot programs in New York. 
 But there are also benefits,and significant changes underwaynon left-leaning policies.,Arguments that government shouldnexpand its role and responsibility,so that it's not so narrowly defined,and that government should benmuch more of an arbiter,of the factors of production,have become commonplacenwith the success of China.,But also we've started to have debates,about how the role of the private sector,should move awaynfrom just being a profit motive,and really be more engagednin the delivery of social programs.,Things like the corporatensocial responsibility programs,,albeit small in scale,,are moving in that right direction.,Of course, left-leaning policiesnhave also tended to blur the lines,between government,nNGOs and private sector. 
 Two very good examples of thisnare the 19th-century United States,,when the infrastructure rollout,was really aboutnpublic-private partnerships.,More recently, of course,,the advent of the Internetnhas also proven to the world,that public and private can work togethernfor the betterment of society. 
 My fundamental message to you is this:,We cannot continue to try and solventhe world economic growth challenges,by being dogmaticnand being unnecessarily ideological.,In order to create sustainable,nlong-term economic growth,and solve the challenges and social illsnthat continue to plague the world today,,we're going to have to benmore broad-minded,about what might work. 
 Ultimately,,we have to recognizenthat ideology is the enemy of growth. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: I want to askna couple of questions, Dambisa,,because one could reactnto your last sentence,by saying growth is also an ideology,,it's possibly the dominantnideology of our times.,What do you saynto those who react that way? 
 DM: Well, I think that that'sncompletely legitimate,,and I think that we're alreadynhaving that discussion.,There's a lot of workngoing on around happiness,and other metrics being usednfor measuring people's success,and improvements in living standards.,And so I think that we should be open,to what could deliver improvementsnin people's living standards,and continue to reducenpoverty around the world. 
 BG: So you're basically pleadingnfor rehabilitating growth,,but the only way for that happen,without compromisingnthe capacity of the earth,,to take us on a long journey,,is for economic growth,somehow to decouplenfrom the underlying use of resources.,Do you see that happening? 
 DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimisticnabout human ability and ingenuity.,I think if we start to constrain ourselves,using the finite, scarcenand depleting resources,that we know today,,we could get quite negative,and quite concernednabout the way the world is. 
 However, we've seen the Club of Rome,,we've seen previous claims,that the world would benrunning out of resources,,and it's not to arguenthat those things are not valid.,But I think, with ingenuitynwe could see desalination,,I think we could reinvest in energy,,so that we can actuallynget better outcomes.,And so in that sense,,I'm much more optimisticnabout what humans can do. 
 BG: The thing that strikes me,about your proposalsnfor rehabilitating growth,and taking a different direction,is that you're kind of suggestingnto fix capitalism with more capitalism --,with putting a price tagnon good behavior as incentive,or developing a bigger rolenfor business in social issues.,Is that what you're suggesting? 
 DM: I'm suggestingnwe have to be open-minded.,I think it is absolutely the case,that traditional models of economic growth,are not working the waynwe would like them to.,And I think it's no accident,that today the largestneconomy in the world, the United States,,has democracy,,liberal democracy,nas it's core political stance,and it has free market capitalism --,to the extent that it is free --,free market capitalismnas its economic stance.,The second largest economy is China.,It has deprioritized democracy,and it has state capitalism,nwhich is a completely different model.,These two countries,ncompletely different political models,and completely different economic models,,and yet they have the samenincome inequality number,measured as a Gini coefficient. 
 I think those are the debatesnwe should have,,because it's not clear at all,what model we should be adopting,,and I think there needs to benmuch more discourse,and much more humilitynabout what we know and what we don't know. 
 BG: One last question.nThe COP21 is going on in Paris.,If you could send a tweet,to all the heads of statenand heads of delegations there,,what would you say? 
 DM: Again, I would be very muchnabout being open-minded.,As you're aware,,the issues aroundnthe environmental concerns,have been on the agenda many times now --,in Copenhagen,n'72 in Stockholm --,and we keep revisiting these issues,partly because there is notna fundamental agreement,,in fact there's a schism,between what the developedncountries believe and want,and what emerging market countries want.,Emerging market countries neednto continue to create economic growth,so that we don't have politicalnuncertainty in the those countries.,Developed countries recognize,that they have a real,nimportant responsibility,not only just to managentheir CO2 emissions,and some of the degradationnthat they're contributing to the world,,but also as trendsetters in R&D.,And so they have to comento the table as well.,But in essence, it cannot be a situation,where we start ascribing policiesnto the emerging markets,without developed countries themselves,also taking quite a swipenat what they're doing,both in demand and supplynin developed markets. 
 BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.nDM: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Imagine you're in Rome,,and you've made your waynto the Vatican Museums.,And you've been shufflingndown long corridors,,past statues, frescoes,nlots and lots of stuff.,You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.,At last -- a long corridor,na stair and a door.,You're at the thresholdnof the Sistine Chapel. 
 So what are you expecting?,Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?,We don't really have any of that there.,Instead, you may ask yourself,nwhat do we have? 
 Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.,And I mean literally, you're surroundednby painted curtains,,the original decoration of this chapel.,Churches used tapestries not justnto keep out cold during long masses,,but as a way to representnthe great theater of life.,The human drama in which each one of usnplays a part is a great story,,a story that encompasses the whole world,and that came to unfoldnin the three stages,of the painting in the Sistine Chapel. 
 Now, this building started outnas a space for a small group,of wealthy, educated Christian priests.,They prayed there.nThey elected their pope there.,Five hundred years ago,,it was the ultimatenecclesiastical man cave.,So, you may ask, how can it benthat today it attracts and delights,five million people a year,,from all different backgrounds?,Because in that compressed space,nthere was a creative explosion,,ignited by the electric excitementnof new geopolitical frontiers,,which set on fire the ancientnmissionary tradition of the Church,and produced one of the greatestnworks of art in history. 
 Now, this development took placenas a great evolution,,moving from the beginning of a few elite,,and eventually able to speaknto audiences of people,that come from all over the world.,This evolution took place in three stages,,each one linkednto a historical circumstance.,The first one was rather limited in scope.,It reflected the rathernparochial perspective.,The second one took place afternworldviews were dramatically altered,after Columbus's historical voyage;,and the third,,when the Age of Discoverynwas well under way,and the Church rose to the challenge,of going global. 
 The original decoration of this churchnreflected a smaller world.,There were busy scenes,that told the stories of the livesnof Jesus and Moses,,reflecting the developmentnof the Jewish and Christian people.,The man who commissioned this,nPope Sixtus IV,,assembled a dream team of Florentine art,,including men like Sandro Botticelli,and the man who would becomenMichelangelo's future painting teacher,,Ghirlandaio.,These men, they blanketed the wallsnwith a frieze of pure color,,and in these stories you'll noticenfamiliar landscapes,,the artists using Roman monumentsnor a Tuscan landscape,to render a faraway story,nsomething much more familiar.,With the addition of imagesnof the Pope's friends and family,,this was a perfect decorationnfor a small court,limited to the European continent.,But in 1492, the New World was discovered,,horizons were expanding,,and this little 133 by 46-footnmicrocosm had to expand as well.,And it did,,thanks to a creative genius,,a visionary and an awesome story. 
 Now, the creative geniusnwas Michelangelo Buonarroti,,33 years old when he was tappednto decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,,and the deck was stacked against him --,he had trained in paintingnbut had left to pursue sculpture.,There were angry patrons in Florencenbecause he had left a stack,of incomplete commissions,,lured to Rome by the prospectnof a great sculptural project,,and that project had fallen through.,And he had been left with a commissionnto paint 12 apostles,against a decorative backgroundnin the Sistine Chapel ceiling,,which would look likenevery other ceiling in Italy. 
 But genius rose to the challenge.,In an age when a man darednto sail across the Atlantic Ocean,,Michelangelo dared to chartnnew artistic waters.,He, too, would tell a story --,no Apostles -- but a storynof great beginnings,,the story of Genesis. 
 Not really an easy sell,nstories on a ceiling.,How would you be able to readna busy scene from 62 feet below?,The painting technique that had beennhanded on for 200 years,in Florentine studios was not equippednfor this kind of a narrative. 
 But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,,and so he played to his strengths.,Instead of being accustomednto filling space with busyness,,he took a hammer and chiselnand hacked away at a piece of marble,to reveal the figure within.,Michelangelo was an essentialist;,he would tell his storynin massive, dynamic bodies. 
 This plan was embracednby the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,,a man who was unafraidnof Michelangelo's brazen genius.,He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,,and he had been steeped in artnfor 30 years and he knew its power.,And history has handed down the monikernof the Warrior Pope,,but this man's legacy to the Vatican --nit wasn't fortresses and artillery,,it was art.,He left us the Raphael Rooms,nthe Sistine Chapel.,He left St. Peter's Basilica,as well as an extraordinary collectionnof Greco-Roman sculptures --,decidedly un-Christian worksnthat would become the seedbed,of the world's first modern museum,nthe Vatican Museums.,Julius was a man,who envisioned a Vaticannthat would be eternally relevant,through grandeur and through beauty,,and he was right.,The encounter between these two giants,nMichelangelo and Julius II,,that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.,Michelangelo was so committednto this project,,that he succeeded in getting the job donenin three and a half years,,using a skeleton crew and spendingnmost of the time, hours on end,,reaching up above his headnto paint the stories on the ceiling. 
 So let's look at this ceiling,and see storytelling gone global.,No more familiar artistic referencesnto the world around you.,There's just spacenand structure and energy;,a monumental painted frameworknwhich opens onto nine panels,,more driven by sculptural formnthan painterly color.,And we stand in the far endnby the entrance,,far from the altar and from the gatednenclosure intended for the clergy,and we peer into the distance,nlooking for a beginning.,And whether in scientific inquirynor in biblical tradition,,we think in terms of a primal spark.,Michelangelo gave us an initial energy,when he gave us the separationnof light and dark,,a churning figure blurry in the distance,,compressed into a tight space.,The next figure looms larger,,and you see a figure hurtlingnfrom one side to the next.,He leaves in his wakenthe sun, the moon, vegetation.,Michelangelo didn't focusnon the stuff that was being created,,unlike all the other artists.,He focused on the act of creation. 
 And then the movement stops,nlike a caesura in poetry,and the creator hovers.,So what's he doing?,Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?,Or is he looking back over his handiwork,nthe universe and his treasures,,just like Michelangelo must have,,looking back over his work in the ceiling,and proclaiming, "It is good." 
 So now the scene is set,,and you get to the culminationnof creation, which is man.,Adam leaps to the eye, a light figurenagainst a dark background.,But looking closer,,that leg is pretty languid on the ground,,the arm is heavy on the knee.,Adam lacks that interior spark,that will impel him to greatness.,That spark is about to be conferrednby the creator in that finger,,which is one millimeternfrom the hand of Adam.,It puts us at the edge of our seats,,because we're one momentnfrom that contact,,through which that mannwill discover his purpose,,leap up and take his placenat the pinnacle of creation. 
 And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.,Who is in that other arm?,Eve, first woman.,No, she's not an afterthought.nShe's part of the plan.,She's always been in his mind.,Look at her, so intimate with Godnthat her hand curls around his arm.,And for me, an American art historiannfrom the 21st century,,this was the momentnthat the painting spoke to me.,Because I realized that thisnrepresentation of the human drama,was always about men and women --,so much so, that the dead center,nthe heart of the ceiling,,is the creation of woman, not Adam.,And the fact is, that when you see themntogether in the Garden of Eden,,they fall together,and together their proud posturenturns into folded shame. 
 You are at critical juncturennow in the ceiling.,You are exactly at the pointnwhere you and I can go,no further into the church.,The gated enclosure keeps usnout of the inner sanctum,,and we are cast outnmuch like Adam and Eve.,The remaining scenes in the ceiling,,they mirror the crowded chaosnof the world around us.,You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.,You have Noah. He's making a sacrificenand a covenant with God.,Maybe he's the savior.,Oh, but no, Noah is the onenwho grew grapes, invented wine,,got drunk and passed outnnaked in his barn.,It is a curious way to design the ceiling,,now starting out with God creating life,,ending up with some guynblind drunk in a barn.,And so, compared with Adam,,you might think Michelangelonis making fun of us. 
 But he's about to dispel the gloom,by using those bright colorsnright underneath Noah:,emerald, topaz, scarletnon the prophet Zechariah.,Zechariah foresees a lightncoming from the east,,and we are turned at this juncturento a new destination,,with sibyls and prophetsnwho will lead us on a parade.,You have the heroes and heroinesnwho make safe the way,,and we follow the mothers and fathers.,They are the motors of this greatnhuman engine, driving it forward. 
 And now we're at the keystonenof the ceiling,,the culmination of the whole thing,,with a figure that looks likenhe's about to fall out of his space,into our space,,encroaching our space. 
 This is the most important juncture.,Past meets present.,This figure, Jonah, who spentnthree days in the belly of the whale,,for the Christians, is the symbolnof the renewal of humanity,through Jesus' sacrifice,,but for the multitudesnof visitors to that museum,from all faiths who visit there every day,,he is the moment the distant pastnencounters and meets immediate reality. 
 All of this brings us to the yawningnarchway of the altar wall,,where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,,painted in 1534 after the worldnhad changed again.,The Reformation had splintered the Church,,the Ottoman Empire had madenIslam a household word,and Magellan had found a routeninto the Pacific Ocean.,How is a 59-year-old artist who has nevernbeen any further than Venice,going to speak to this new world?,Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,,that universal desire,,common to all of us,,to leave a legacy of excellence.,Told in terms of the Christian visionnof the Last Judgment,,the end of the world,,Michelangelo gave you a series of figures,who are wearing thesenstrikingly beautiful bodies.,They have no more covers,nno more portraits,except for a couple.,It's a composition only out of bodies,,391, no two alike,,unique like each and every one of us.,They start in the lower corner,nbreaking away from the ground,,struggling and trying to rise.,Those who have risennreach back to help others,,and in one amazing vignette,,you have a black man and a white mannpulled up together,in an incredible vision of human unity,in this new world.,The lion's share of the spacengoes to the winner's circle.,There you find men and womenncompletely nude like athletes.,They are the onesnwho have overcome adversity,,and Michelangelo's visionnof people who combat adversity,,overcome obstacles --,they're just like athletes.,So you have men and womennflexing and posing,in this extraordinary spotlight.,Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,,first a suffering man on the cross,,now a glorious ruler in Heaven.,And as Michelangelonproved in his painting,,hardship, setbacks and obstacles,,they don't limit excellence,nthey forge it. 
 Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.,This is the Pope's private chapel,,and the best way you can describe thatnis indeed a stew of nudes.,But Michelangelo was trying to usenonly the best artistic language,,the most universal artistic languagenhe could think of:,that of the human body.,And so instead of the way of showingnvirtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,,he borrowed from Julius II'snwonderful collection of sculptures,in order to show inner strengthnas external power. 
 Now, one contemporary did write,that the chapel was too beautifulnto not cause controversy.,And so it did.,Michelangelo soon foundnthat thanks to the printing press,,complaints about the nuditynspread all over the place,,and soon his masterpiece of human dramanwas labeled pornography,,at which point he addedntwo more portraits,,one of the man who criticized him,na papal courtier,,and the other one of himselfnas a dried up husk, no athlete,,in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.,The year he died he sawnseveral of these figures covered over,,a triumph for trivial distractionsnover his great exhortation to glory. 
 And so now we stand,in the here and now.,We are caught in that space,between beginnings and endings,,in the great, huge totalitynof the human experience.,The Sistine Chapel forces usnto look around as if it were a mirror.,Who am I in this picture?,Am I one of the crowd?,Am I the drunk guy?,Am I the athlete?,And as we leave this havennof uplifting beauty,,we are inspired to ask ourselvesnlife's biggest questions:,Who am I, and what role do I playnin this great theater of life? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you. 
 Elizabeth, you mentionednthis whole issue of pornography,,too many nudes and too manyndaily life scenes and improper things,in the eyes of the time.,But actually the story is bigger.,It's not just touching upnand covering up some of the figures.,This work of art was almostndestroyed because of that. 
 Elizabeth Lev: The effectnof the Last Judgment was enormous.,The printing press made surenthat everybody saw it.,And so, this wasn't somethingnthat happened within a couple of weeks.,It was something that happenednover the space of 20 years,of editorials and complaints,,saying to the Church,,"You can't possibly tell usnhow to live our lives.,Did you notice you havenpornography in the Pope's chapel?",And so after complaints and insistence,of trying to get this work destroyed,,it was finally the yearnthat Michelangelo died,that the Church finallynfound a compromise,,a way to save the painting,,and that was in putting upnthese extra 30 covers,,and that happens to benthe origin of fig-leafing.,That's where it all came about,,and it came about from a churchnthat was trying to save a work of art,,not indeed deface or destroyed it. 
 BG: This, what you just gave us,nis not the classic tour,that people get todaynwhen they go to the Sistine Chapel. 
 (Laughter) 
 EL: I don't know, is that an ad? 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: No, no, no, not necessarily,nit is a statement.,The experience of art todaynis encountering problems.,Too many people want to see this there,,and the result is five million peoplengoing through that tiny door,and experiencing itnin a completely different way,than we just did. 
 EL: Right. I agree. I think it's reallynnice to be able to pause and look.,But also realize,neven when you're in those days,,with 28,000 people a day,,even those days when you're in therenwith all those other people,,look around you and thinknhow amazing it is,that some painted plasternfrom 500 years ago,can still draw all those peoplenstanding side by side with you,,looking upwards with their jaws dropped.,It's a great statement about how beautyntruly can speak to us all,through time and through geographic space. 
 BG: Liz, grazie. 
 EL: Grazie a te. 
 BG: Thank you. 
 (Applause)A hundred years ago this month,na 36-year-old Albert Einstein,stood up in front of the PrussiannAcademy of Sciences in Berlin,to present a radical new theorynof space, time and gravity:,the general theory of relativity. 
 General relativity is unquestionablynEinstein's masterpiece,,a theory which reveals the workingsnof the universe at the grandest scales,,capturing in one beautiful line of algebra,everything from why apples fall from treesnto the beginning of time and space. 
 1915 must have been an exciting yearnto be a physicist.,Two new ideas were turningnthe subject on its head.,One was Einstein's theory of relativity,,the other was arguablyneven more revolutionary:,quantum mechanics,,a mind-meltingly strangenyet stunningly successful new way,of understanding the microworld,nthe world of atoms and particles. 
 Over the last century,nthese two ideas have utterly transformed,our understanding of the universe.,It's thanks to relativitynand quantum mechanics,that we've learnednwhat the universe is made from,,how it begannand how it continues to evolve.,A hundred years on, we now find ourselvesnat another turning point in physics,,but what's at stake nownis rather different.,The next few years may tell usnwhether we'll be able,to continue to increasenour understanding of nature,,or whether maybe for the first timenin the history of science,,we could be facing questionsnthat we cannot answer,,not because we don't haventhe brains or technology,,but because the laws of physicsnthemselves forbid it. 
 This is the essential problem:nthe universe is far, far too interesting.,Relativity and quantum mechanicsnappear to suggest,that the universenshould be a boring place.,It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.,But when we look around us, we see we livenin a universe full of interesting stuff,,full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.,The question is, ultimately,,why does all this interesting stuff exist?,Why is there somethingnrather than nothing?,This contradiction is the most pressingnproblem in fundamental physics,,and in the next few years, we may find outnwhether we'll ever be able to solve it. 
 At the heart of this problemnare two numbers,,two extremely dangerous numbers.,These are properties of the universenthat we can measure,,and they're extremely dangerous,because if they were different,neven by a tiny bit,,then the universe as we know itnwould not exist.,The first of these numbers is associatednwith the discovery that was made,a few kilometers from this hall,nat CERN, home of this machine,,the largest scientific devicenever built by the human race,,the Large Hadron Collider.,The LHC whizzes subatomic particlesnaround a 27-kilometer ring,,getting them closer and closernto the speed of light,before smashing them into each otherninside gigantic particle detectors.,On July 4, 2012, physicistsnat CERN announced to the world,that they'd spottedna new fundamental particle,being created at the violent collisionsnat the LHC: the Higgs boson. 
 Now, if you followed the news at the time,,you'll have seen a lot of physicistsngetting very excited indeed,,and you'd be forgiven for thinking,we get that way every timenwe discover a new particle.,Well, that is kind of true,,but the Higgs bosonnis particularly special.,We all got so excitednbecause finding the Higgs,proves the existencenof a cosmic energy field.,Now, you may have troublenimagining an energy field,,but we've all experienced one.,If you've ever held a magnetnclose to a piece of metal,and felt a force pulling across that gap,,then you've felt the effect of a field.,And the Higgs fieldnis a little bit like a magnetic field,,except it has a constant value everywhere.,It's all around us right now.,We can't see it or touch it,,but if it wasn't there,,we would not exist.,The Higgs field gives mass,to the fundamental particlesnthat we're made from.,If it wasn't there, those particlesnwould have no mass,,and no atoms could formnand there would be no us. 
 But there is something deeply mysteriousnabout the Higgs field.,Relativity and quantum mechanics tell usnthat it has two natural settings,,a bit like a light switch.,It should either be off,,so that it has a zero valueneverywhere in space,,or it should be on so it hasnan absolutely enormous value.,In both of these scenarios,natoms could not exist,,and therefore all the otherninteresting stuff,that we see around usnin the universe would not exist.,In reality, the Higgs fieldnis just slightly on,,not zero but 10,000 trillion times weakernthan its fully on value,,a bit like a light switch that's got stucknjust before the off position.,And this value is crucial.,If it were a tiny bit different,,then there would benno physical structure in the universe. 
 So this is the firstnof our dangerous numbers,,the strength of the Higgs field.,Theorists have spent decadesntrying to understand,why it has this very peculiarlynfine-tuned number,,and they've come upnwith a number of possible explanations.,They have sexy-sounding namesnlike "supersymmetry",or "large extra dimensions.",I'm not going to goninto the details of these ideas now,,but the key point is this:,if any of them explained this weirdlynfine-tuned value of the Higgs field,,then we should see new particlesnbeing created at the LHC,along with the Higgs boson.,So far, though, we've not seennany sign of them. 
 But there's actually an even worse example,of this kind of fine-tuningnof a dangerous number,,and this time it comesnfrom the other end of the scale,,from studying the universenat vast distances.,One of the most important consequencesnof Einstein's general theory of relativity,was the discovery that the universe begannas a rapid expansion of space and time,13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.,Now, according to early versionsnof the Big Bang theory,,the universe has been expanding ever since,with gravity gradually puttingnthe brakes on that expansion.,But in 1998, astronomers madenthe stunning discovery,that the expansion of the universenis actually speeding up.,The universe is gettingnbigger and bigger faster and faster,driven by a mysterious repulsive forcencalled dark energy. 
 Now, whenever you hearnthe word "dark" in physics,,you should get very suspicious,because it probably meansnwe don't know what we're talking about. 
 (Laughter) 
 We don't know what dark energy is,,but the best idea is that it's the energynof empty space itself,,the energy of the vacuum.,Now, if you use good oldnquantum mechanics to work out,how strong dark energy should be,,you get an absolutely astonishing result.,You find that dark energy,should be 10 to the powernof 120 times stronger,than the value we observe from astronomy.,That's one with 120 zeroes after it.,This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge,that it's impossiblento get your head around.,We often use the word "astronomical"nwhen we're talking about big numbers.,Well, even that one won't do here.,This number is biggernthan any number in astronomy.,It's a thousand trillionntrillion trillion times bigger,than the number of atomsnin the entire universe. 
 So that's a pretty bad prediction.,In fact, it's been callednthe worst prediction in physics,,and this is more than justna theoretical curiosity.,If dark energy werenanywhere near this strong,,then the universenwould have been torn apart,,stars and galaxies could not form,nand we would not be here.,So this is the secondnof those dangerous numbers,,the strength of dark energy,,and explaining it requires an even morenfantastic level of fine-tuning,than we saw for the Higgs field.,But unlike the Higgs field,nthis number has no known explanation. 
 The hope was that a complete combination,of Einstein's generalntheory of relativity,,which is the theorynof the universe at grand scales,,with quantum mechanics, the theorynof the universe at small scales,,might provide a solution.,Einstein himselfnspent most of his later years,on a futile searchnfor a unified theory of physics,,and physicists have kept at it ever since. 
 One of the most promising candidatesnfor a unified theory is string theory,,and the essential idea is,,if you could zoom in on the fundamentalnparticles that make up our world,,you'd see actuallynthat they're not particles at all,,but tiny vibrating strings of energy,,with each frequency of vibrationncorresponding to a different particle,,a bit like musical notesnon a guitar string. 
 So it's a rather elegant, almost poeticnway of looking at the world,,but it has one catastrophic problem.,It turns out that string theorynisn't one theory at all,,but a whole collection of theories.,It's been estimated, in fact,,that there are 10 to the 500ndifferent versions of string theory.,Each one would describena different universe,with different laws of physics.,Now, critics say this makesnstring theory unscientific.,You can't disprove the theory.,But others actuallynturned this on its head,and said, well,nmaybe this apparent failure,is string theory's greatest triumph.,What if all of these 10 to the 500ndifferent possible universes,actually exist out there somewhere,in some grand multiverse?,Suddenly we can understand,the weirdly fine-tuned valuesnof these two dangerous numbers.,In most of the multiverse,,dark energy is so strongnthat the universe gets torn apart,,or the Higgs field is so weaknthat no atoms can form.,We live in one of the placesnin the multiverse,where the two numbers are just right.,We live in a Goldilocks universe. 
 Now, this idea is extremely controversial,nand it's easy to see why.,If we follow this line of thinking,,then we will never be ablento answer the question,,"Why is there somethingnrather than nothing?",In most of the multiverse,nthere is nothing,,and we live in one of the few places,where the laws of physicsnallow there to be something.,Even worse, we can't testnthe idea of the multiverse.,We can't access these other universes,,so there's no way of knowingnwhether they're there or not. 
 So we're in an extremelynfrustrating position.,That doesn't meannthe multiverse doesn't exist.,There are other planets,nother stars, other galaxies,,so why not other universes?,The problem is, it's unlikelynwe'll ever know for sure.,Now, the idea of the multiversenhas been around for a while,,but in the last few years,nwe've started to get the first solid hints,that this line of reasoningnmay get born out.,Despite high hopesnfor the first run of the LHC,,what we were looking for there --,we were lookingnfor new theories of physics:,supersymmetry or large extra dimensions,that could explain this weirdlynfine-tuned value of the Higgs field.,But despite high hopes, the LHCnrevealed a barren subatomic wilderness,populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.,My experiment published paper after paper,where we glumly had to concludenthat we saw no signs of new physics. 
 The stakes now could not be higher.,This summer, the LHC begannits second phase of operation,with an energy almost doublenwhat we achieved in the first run.,What particle physicistsnare all desperately hoping for,are signs of new particles,nmicro black holes,,or maybe something totally unexpected,emerging from the violent collisionsnat the Large Hadron Collider.,If so, then we can continuenthis long journey,that began 100 years agonwith Albert Einstein,towards an ever deeper understandingnof the laws of nature. 
 But if, in two or three years' time,,when the LHC switches off againnfor a second long shutdown,,we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,,then we may be enteringna new era in physics:,an era where there are weird featuresnof the universe that we cannot explain;,an era where we have hintsnthat we live in a multiverse,that lies frustratinglynforever beyond our reach;,an era where we will never be ablento answer the question,,"Why is there somethingnrather than nothing?" 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Harry,neven if you just said,the science may not have some answers,,I would like to ask you a couplenof questions, and the first is:,building something like the LHCnis a generational project.,I just mentioned, introducing you,nthat we live in a short-term world.,How do you think so long term,,projecting yourself out a generationnwhen building something like this? 
 Harry Cliff: I was very lucky,that I joined the experimentnI work on at the LHC in 2008,,just as we were switching on,,and there are people in my research groupnwho have been working on it,for three decades,ntheir entire careers on one machine.,So I think the first conversationsnabout the LHC were in 1976,,and you start planning the machinenwithout the technology,that you know you're going to neednto be able to build it.,So the computing powerndid not exist in the early '90s,when design work began in earnest.,One of the big detectorsnwhich record these collisions,,they didn't think there was technology,that could withstand the radiationnthat would be created in the LHC,,so there was basically a lump of leadnin the middle of this object,with some detectors around the outside,,but subsequentlynwe have developed technology.,So you have to rely on people's ingenuity,nthat they will solve the problems,,but it may be a decadenor more down the line. 
 BG: China just announcedntwo or three weeks ago,that they intend to build,a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.,I was wondering how younand your colleagues welcome the news. 
 HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.nBG: I'm sure. I'm sure. 
 (Laughter) 
 It sounds funny for a particlenphysicist to say that.,But I mean, seriously, it's great news.,So building a machine like the LHC,requires countries from all over the worldnto pool their resources.,No one nation can affordnto build a machine this large,,apart from maybe China,,because they can mobilizenhuge amounts of resources,,manpower and moneynto build machines like this.,So it's only a good thing.,What they're really planning to donis to build a machine,that will study the Higgs boson in detailnand could give us some clues,as to whether these new ideas,nlike supersymmetry, are really out there,,so it's great news for physics, I think. 
 BG: Harry, thank you.nHC: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)A few years ago,,I got one of those spam emails.,And it managednto get through my spam filter.,I'm not quite sure how,nbut it turned up in my inbox,,and it was from a guyncalled Solomon Odonkoh. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know. 
 (Laughter) 
 It went like this:,it said, "Hello James Veitch,,I have an interesting business proposalnI want to share with you, Solomon.",Now, my hand was kind of hoveringnon the delete button, right?,I was looking at my phone.nI thought, I could just delete this.,Or I could do what I thinknwe've all always wanted to do. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said, "Solomon,nYour email intrigues me." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And the game was afoot. 
 He said, "Dear James Veitch,nWe shall be shipping Gold to you." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You will earn 10\%nof any gold you distributes." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I knew I was dealingnwith a professional. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "How much is it worth?" 
 He said, "We will startnwith smaller quantity," --,I was like, aww --,and then he said, "of 25 kgs. 
 (Laughter) 
 The worth should be about $2.5 million." 
 I said, "Solomon, if we'rengoing to do it, let's go big. 
 (Applause) 
 I can handle it.nHow much gold do you have?" 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "It is not a matternof how much gold I have,,what matters isnyour capability of handling.,We can start with 50 kgsnas trial shipment." 
 I said, "50 kgs?,There's no point doing this at all,unless you're shippingnat least a metric ton." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 He said, "What do you do for a living?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "I'm a hedge fundnexecutive bank manager." 
 (Laughter) 
 This isn't the first timenI've shipped bullion, my friend,,no no no. 
 Then I started to panic.,I was like, "Where are you based?",I don't know about you,,but I think if we're goingnvia the postal service,,it ought to be signed for.,That's a lot of gold." 
 He said, "It will not be easynto convince my company,to do larger quantity shipment." 
 I said, "Solomon, I'm completelynwith you on this one.,I'm putting together a visual for younto take into the board meeting.,Hold tight." 
 (Laughter) 
 This is what I sent Solomon. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I don't know if we havenany statisticians in the house,,but there's definitely something going on. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Solomon, attached to this emailnyou'll find a helpful chart.,I've had one of my assistantsnrun the numbers. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're ready for shippingnas much gold as possible." 
 There's always a moment where they trynto tug your heartstrings,,and this was it for Solomon.,He said, "I will be so much happynif the deal goes well,,because I'm going to getna very good commission as well.",And I said, "That's amazing,nWhat are you going to spend your cut on?",And he said, "On RealEstate,nwhat about you?" 
 I thought about it for a long time.,And I said, "One word;,Hummus." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It's going places. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was in Sainsbury's the other day,and there were liken30 different varieties.,Also you can cut up carrots,nand you can dip them.,Have you ever done that, Solomon?" 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "I have to go bed now." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "Till morrow.,Have sweet dream." 
 I didn't know what to say!,I said, "Bonsoirnmy golden nugget, bonsoir." 
 (Laughter) 
 Guys, you have to understand,nthis had been going for, like, weeks,,albeit hitherto the greatestnweeks of my life,,but I had to knock it on the head.,It was getting a bit out of hand.,Friends were saying, "James,ndo you want to come for a drink?",I was like, "I can't, I'm expectingnan email about some gold." 
 So I figured I hadnto knock it on the head.,I had to take itnto a ridiculous conclusion.,So I concocted a plan.,I said, "Solomon,nI'm concerned about security.,When we email each other,,we need to use a code.",And he agreed. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Solomon, I spent all nightncoming up with this code,we need to usenin all further correspondence: 
 Lawyer: Gummy Bear. 
 Bank: Cream Egg. 
 Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.nClaim: Peanut M&Ms. 
 Documents: Jelly Beans. 
 Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard." 
 (Laughter) 
 I knew these were all wordsnthey use, right?,I said, "Please call me Kitkatnin all further correspondence." 
 (Laughter) 
 I didn't hear back.nI thought, I've gone too far.,I've gone too far.nSo I had to backpedal a little.,I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?,KitKat." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because you have to be consistent.,Then I did get an email back from him.,He said, "The Business is onnand I am trying to blah blah blah ..." 
 I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!",What followed is the greatest emailnI've ever received. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not joking, this is whatnturned up in my inbox.,This was a good day.,"The business is on.,I am trying to raise the balancenfor the Gummy Bear -- 
 (Laughter) 
 so he can submit all the needednFizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans,to the Creme Egg,,for the Peanut M&Ms process to start. 
 (Laughter) 
 Send 1,500 pounds,via a Giant Gummy Lizard." 
 (Applause) 
 And that was so much fun, right,,that it got me thinking:,like, what would happen if I just spentnas much time as could,replying to as manynscam emails as I could?,And that's what I've been doing,for three years,on your behalf. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Crazy stuff happens when you startnreplying to scam emails.,It's really difficult,,and I highly recommend we do it.,I don't think what I'm doing is mean.,There are a lot of peoplenwho do mean things to scammers.,All I'm doing is wasting their time.,And I think any timenthey're spending with me,is time they're not spendingnscamming vulnerable adults,out of their savings, right? 
 And if you're going to do this --nand I highly recommend you do --,get yourself a pseudonymous email address.,Don't use your own email address.,That's what I was doing at the startnand it was a nightmare.,I'd wake up in the morningnand have a thousand emails,about penis enlargements,,only one of whichnwas a legitimate response -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to a medical question I had. 
 But I'll tell you what, though, guys,,I'll tell you what: any day is a good day,nany day is a good day,if you receive an emailnthat begins like this: 
 (Laughter) 
 "I AM WINNIE MANDELA,,THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELAnTHE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT.",I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know so many. 
 "I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARSnOUT OF THE COUNTRY,BECAUSE OF MY HUSBANDnNELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION." 
 Let that sink in.,She sent me this, which is hysterical. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this.,And this looks fairly legitimate,nthis is a letter of authorization.,But to be honest, if there's nothingnwritten on it, it's just a shape! 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Winnie,nI'm really sorry to hear of this.,Given that Nelson died three months ago,,I'd describe his health conditionnas fairly serious." 
 (Laughter) 
 That's the worst health conditionnyou can have, not being alive. 
 She said, "KINDLY COMPLYnWITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.,ONE LOVE." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEEDnTRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "no problemo. 
 I SHOT THE SHERIFF." 
 [ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I believe that the secret to producingnextremely drought-tolerant crops,,which should go some waynto providing food security in the world,,lies in resurrection plants,,pictured here, in an extremelyndroughted state.,You might thinknthat these plants look dead,,but they're not.,Give them water,,and they will resurrect, green up,nstart growing, in 12 to 48 hours. 
 Now, why would I suggest,that producing drought-tolerant cropsnwill go towards providing food security?,Well, the current world populationnis around 7 billion.,And it's estimated that by 2050,,we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,,with the bulk of this growthnhappening in Africa. 
 The food and agriculturalnorganizations of the world,have suggested that we needna 70 percent increase,in current agricultural practice,to meet that demand.,Given that plantsnare at the base of the food chain,,most of that's goingnto have to come from plants. 
 That percentage of 70 percent,does not take into considerationnthe potential effects of climate change. 
 This is taken from a study by Dainpublished in 2011,,where he took into consideration,all the potential effectsnof climate change,and expressed them --namongst other things --,increased aridity due to lack of rainnor infrequent rain.,The areas in red shown here,,are areas that until recently,have been very successfullynused for agriculture,,but cannot anymorenbecause of lack of rainfall.,This is the situationnthat's predicted to happen in 2050.,Much of Africa,nin fact, much of the world,,is going to be in trouble.,We're going to have to think of somenvery smart ways of producing food.,And preferably among them,nsome drought-tolerant crops. 
 The other thingnto remember about Africa is,that most of their agriculture is rainfed. 
 Now, making drought-tolerant cropsnis not the easiest thing in the world.,And the reason for this is water.,Water is essential to life on this planet.,All living, activelynmetabolizing organisms,,from microbes to you and I,,are comprised predominately of water.,All life reactions happen in water.,And loss of a small amountnof water results in death.,You and I are 65 percent water --,we lose one percent of that, we die.,But we can make behavioralnchanges to avoid that.,Plants can't.,They're stuck in the ground.,And so in the first instance they havena little bit more water than us,,about 95 percent water,,and they can losena little bit more than us,,like 10 to about 70 percent,ndepending on the species,,but for short periods only. 
 Most of them will either trynto resist or avoid water loss.,So extreme examples of resistorsncan be found in succulents.,They tend to be small, very attractive,,but they hold onto their waternat such great cost,that they grow extremely slowly.,Examples of avoidance of water lossnare found in trees and shrubs.,They send down very deep roots,,mine subterranean water supplies,and just keep flushingnit through them at all times,,keeping themselves hydrated. 
 The one on the right is called a baobab.,It's also called the upside-down tree,,simply because the proportionnof roots to shoots is so great,that it looks like the treenhas been planted upside down.,And of course the roots are requirednfor hydration of that plant. 
 And probably the most common strategynof avoidance is found in annuals.,Annuals make up the bulknof our plant food supplies.,Up the west coast of my country,,for much of the yearnyou don't see much vegetation growth.,But come the spring rains, you get this:,flowering of the desert. 
 The strategy in annuals,,is to grow only in the rainy season.,At the end of that seasonnthey produce a seed,,which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,,but very much alive.,And anything that isnthat dry and still alive,,we call desiccation-tolerant. 
 In the desiccated state,,what seeds can donis lie in extremes of environment,for prolonged periods of time.,The next time the rainy season comes,,they germinate and grow,,and the whole cycle just starts again. 
 It's widely believed that the evolutionnof desiccation-tolerant seeds,allowed the colonization and the radiation,of flowering plants,nor angiosperms, onto land. 
 But back to annualsnas our major form of food supplies.,Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percentnof our plant food supplies.,And it's been a great strategy,because in a short space of timenyou can produce a lot of seed.,Seeds are energy-richnso there's a lot of food calories,,you can store it in times of plentynfor times of famine,,but there's a downside.,The vegetative tissues,,the roots and leaves of annuals,,do not have much,by way of inherent resistance,navoidance or tolerance characteristics.,They just don't need them.,They grow in the rainy season,and they've got a seednto help them survive the rest of the year. 
 And so despite concertednefforts in agriculture,to make crops with improved properties,of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --,particularly resistance and avoidance,because we've had good modelsnto understand how those work --,we still get images like this.,Maize crop in Africa,,two weeks without rain,and it's dead. 
 There is a solution:,resurrection plants.,These plants can lose 95 percentnof their cellular water,,remain in a dry, dead-like statenfor months to years,,and give them water,,they green up and start growing again.,Like seeds, these arendesiccation-tolerant.,Like seeds, these can withstand extremesnof environmental conditions.,And this is a really rare phenomenon.,There are only 135 floweringnplant species that can do this. 
 I'm going to show you a video,of the resurrection processnof these three species,in that order.,And at the bottom,,there's a time axisnso you can see how quickly it happens. 
 (Applause) 
 Pretty amazing, huh? 
 So I've spent the last 21 yearsntrying to understand how they do this.,How do these plants dry without dying?,And I work on a varietynof different resurrection plants,,shown here in the hydrated and dry states,,for a number of reasons. 
 One of them is that eachnof these plants serves as a model,for a crop that I'd likento make drought-tolerant. 
 So on the extreme top left,nfor example, is a grass,,it's called Eragrostis nindensis,,it's got a close relativencalled Eragrostis tef --,a lot of you might know it as "teff" --,it's a staple food in Ethiopia,,it's gluten-free,,and it's something we would likento make drought-tolerant. 
 The other reason for lookingnat a number of plants,,is that, at least initially,,I wanted to find out:ndo they do the same thing?,Do they all use the same mechanisms,to be able to losenall that water and not die? 
 So I undertook what we callna systems biology approach,in order to getna comprehensive understanding,of desiccation tolerance,,in which we look at everything,from the molecular to the whole plant,necophysiological level. 
 For example we look at things like,changes in the plant anatomynas they dried out,and their ultrastructure.,We look at the transcriptome,nwhich is just a term for a technology,in which we look at the genes,that are switched on or off,nin response to drying.,Most genes will code for proteins,nso we look at the proteome.,What are the proteins madenin response to drying?,Some proteins would code for enzymesnwhich make metabolites,,so we look at the metabolome. 
 Now, this is importantnbecause plants are stuck in the ground.,They use what I callna highly tuned chemical arsenal,to protect themselves from allnthe stresses of their environment.,So it's important that we look,at the chemical changesninvolved in drying. 
 And at the last studynthat we do at the molecular level,,we look at the lipidome --,the lipid changes in response to drying.,And that's also important,because all biological membranesnare made of lipids.,They're held as membranesnbecause they're in water.,Take away the water,nthose membranes fall apart.,Lipids also act as signalsnto turn on genes. 
 Then we use physiologicalnand biochemical studies,to try and understandnthe function of the putative protectants,that we've actually discoverednin our other studies.,And then use all of thatnto try and understand,how the plant copesnwith its natural environment. 
 I've always had the philosophy thatnI needed a comprehensive understanding,of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance,in order to make a meaningful suggestionnfor a biotic application. 
 I'm sure some of you are thinking,,"By biotic application,,does she mean she's going to makengenetically modified crops?",And the answer to that question is:,depends on your definitionnof genetic modification. 
 All of the crops that we eat today,nwheat, rice and maize,,are highly genetically modifiednfrom their ancestors,,but we don't consider them GM,because they're being producednby conventional breeding.,If you mean, am I going to putnresurrection plant genes into crops,,your answer is yes. 
 In the essence of time,nwe have tried that approach.,More appropriately,nsome of my collaborators at UCT,,Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,,have spearheaded that approach,and I'm going to show you some data soon. 
 But we're about to embarknupon an extremely ambitious approach,,in which we aim to turn onnwhole suites of genes,that are already present in every crop.,They're just never turned onnunder extreme drought conditions.,I leave it up to you to decide,whether those should be called GM or not. 
 I'm going to now just give younsome of the data from that first approach.,And in order to do that,I have to explain a little bitnabout how genes work. 
 So you probably all know,that genes are madenof double-stranded DNA.,It's wound very tightly into chromosomes,that are present in every cellnof your body or in a plant's body.,If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.,And each gene has a promoter,,which is just an on-off switch,,the gene coding region,,and then a terminator,,which indicates that this is the endnof this gene, the next gene will start. 
 Now, promoters are notnsimple on-off switches.,They normally requirena lot of fine-tuning,,lots of things to be present and correctnbefore that gene is switched on.,So what's typically donenin biotech studies,is that we use an inducible promoter,,we know how to switch it on.,We couple that to genes of interest,and put that into a plantnand see how the plant responds. 
 In the study that I'm goingnto talk to you about,,my collaborators usedna drought-induced promoter,,which we discoverednin a resurrection plant.,The nice thing about this promoternis that we do nothing.,The plant itself senses drought.,And we've used it to drive antioxidantngenes from resurrection plants.,Why antioxidant genes?,Well, all stresses,nparticularly drought stress,,results in the formation of free radicals,,or reactive oxygen species,,which are highly damagingnand can cause crop death.,What antioxidants do is stop that damage. 
 So here's some data from a maize strainnthat's very popularly used in Africa.,To the left of the arrownare plants without the genes,,to the right --,plants with the antioxidant genes.,After three weeks without watering,,the ones with the genesndo a hell of a lot better. 
 Now to the final approach.,My research has shownnthat there's considerable similarity,in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerancenin seeds and resurrection plants.,So I ask the question,,are they using the same genes?,Or slightly differently phrased,,are resurrection plants using genesnevolved in seed desiccation tolerance,in their roots and leaves?,Have they retasked these seed genes,in roots and leavesnof resurrection plants? 
 And I answer that question,,as a consequence of a lotnof research from my group,and recent collaborations from a groupnof Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,,Mel Oliver in the United States,and Julia Buitink in France.,The answer is yes,,that there is a core set of genesnthat are involved in both. 
 And I'm going to illustrate thisnvery crudely for maize,,where the chromosomes below the off switch,represent all the genes that are requirednfor desiccation tolerance.,So as maize seeds dried outnat the end of their period of development,,they switch these genes on.,Resurrection plantsnswitch on the same genes,when they dry out.,All modern crops, therefore,,have these genesnin their roots and leaves,,they just never switch them on.,They only switch them on in seed tissues. 
 So what we're trying to do right now,is to understand the environmentalnand cellular signals,that switch on these genesnin resurrection plants,,to mimic the process in crops. 
 And just a final thought.,What we're trying to do very rapidly,is to repeat what nature didnin the evolution of resurrection plants,some 10 to 40 million years ago. 
 My plants and I thank younfor your attention. 
 (Applause)So I'm a neurosurgeon.,And like most of my colleagues,,I have to deal, every day,nwith human tragedies.,I realize how your life can changenfrom one second to the other,after a major strokenor after a car accident.,And what is very frustratingnfor us neurosurgeons,is to realize that unlikenother organs of the body,,the brain has very littlenability for self-repair.,And after a major injurynof your central nervous system,,the patients often remainnwith a severe handicap.,And that's probablynthe reason why I've chosen,to be a functional neurosurgeon. 
 What is a functional neurosurgeon?,It's a doctor who is trying to improvena neurological function,through different surgical strategies.,You've certainly heard ofnone of the famous ones,called deep brain stimulation,,where you implant an electrodenin the depths of the brain,in order to modulate a circuit of neurons,to improve a neurological function.,It's really an amazing technology,in that it has improvednthe destiny of patients,with Parkinson's disease,,with severe tremor, with severe pain.,However, neuromodulationndoes not mean neuro-repair.,And the dream of functional neurosurgeons,is to repair the brain.,I think,that we are approaching this dream. 
 And I would like to show you,that we are very close to this.,And that with a little bit of help,,the brain is able to help itself. 
 So the story started 15 years ago.,At that time, I was a chief resident,working days and nightsnin the emergency room.,I often had to take carenof patients with head trauma.,You have to imagine that when a patientncomes in with a severe head trauma,,his brain is swelling,and he's increasingnhis intracranial pressure.,And in order to save his life,,you have to decreasenthis intracranial pressure.,And to do that,,you sometimes have to removena piece of swollen brain.,So instead of throwing awaynthese pieces of swollen brain,,we decided with Jean-François Brunet,,who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,,to study them. 
 What do I mean by that?,We wanted to grow cellsnfrom these pieces of tissue.,It's not an easy task.,Growing cells from a piece of tissue,is a bit the same as growingnvery small children,out from their family.,So you need to find the right nutrients,,the warmth, the humidity,and all the nice environmentsnto make them thrive.,So that's exactly what we hadnto do with these cells.,And after many attempts,,Jean-François did it.,And that's what he sawnunder his microscope. 
 And that was, for us, a major surprise.,Why?,Because this looks exactly the samenas a stem cell culture,,with large green cellsnsurrounding small, immature cells.,And you may remember from biology class,that stem cells are immature cells,,able to turn into any typenof cell of the body.,The adult brain has stem cells,nbut they're very rare,and they're locatednin deep and small niches,in the depths of the brain.,So it was surprising to getnthis kind of stem cell culture,from the superficial partnof swollen brain we had,in the operating theater. 
 And there was anothernintriguing observation:,Regular stem cellsnare very active cells --,cells that divide, divide,ndivide very quickly.,And they never die,nthey're immortal cells.,But these cells behave differently.,They divide slowly,,and after a few weeks of culture,,they even died.,So we were in front of a strangennew cell population,that looked like stem cellsnbut behaved differently. 
 And it took us a long timento understand where they came from.,They come from these cells.,These blue and red cells are calledndoublecortin-positive cells.,All of you have them in your brain.,They represent four percentnof your cortical brain cells.,They have a very important rolenduring the development stage.,When you were fetuses,,they helped your brain to fold itself.,But why do they stay in your head?,This, we don't know.,We think that they maynparticipate in brain repair,because we find themnin higher concentration,close to brain lesions.,But it's not so sure.,But there is one clear thing --,that from these cells,,we got our stem cell culture.,And we were in frontnof a potential new source of cells,to repair the brain.,And we had to prove this. 
 So to prove it,,we decided to designnan experimental paradigm.,The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain,in a non-eloquent area of the brain,,and then to culture the cells,exactly the way Jean-Françoisndid it in his lab.,And then label them, to put color in them,in order to be ablento track them in the brain.,And the last step was to re-implant them,in the same individual.,We call these,autologous grafts -- autografts. 
 So the first question we had,,"What will happen if we re-implantnthese cells in a normal brain,,and what will happennif we re-implant the same cells,in a lesioned brain?",Thanks to the helpnof professor Eric Rouiller,,we worked with monkeys. 
 So in the first-case scenario,,we re-implanted the cellsnin the normal brain,and what we saw is that they completelyndisappeared after a few weeks,,as if they were taken from the brain,,they go back home,,the space is already busy,,they are not needed there,nso they disappear. 
 In the second-case scenario,,we performed the lesion,,we re-implanted exactly the same cells,,and in this case, the cells remained --,and they became mature neurons.,And that's the image of whatnwe could observe under the microscope.,Those are the cellsnthat were re-implanted.,And the proof they carry,,these little spots, thosenare the cells that we've labeled,in vitro, when they were in culture. 
 But we could not stop here, of course.,Do these cells also help a monkeynto recover after a lesion?,So for that, we trained monkeysnto perform a manual dexterity task.,They had to retrievenfood pellets from a tray.,They were very good at it.,And when they had reachedna plateau of performance,,we did a lesion in the motor cortexncorresponding to the hand motion.,So the monkeys were plegic,,they could not move their hand anymore.,And exactly the same as humans would do,,they spontaneously recoverednto a certain extent,,exactly the same as after a stroke.,Patients are completely plegic,,and then they try to recoverndue to a brain plasticity mechanism,,they recover to a certain extent,,exactly the same for the monkey. 
 So when we were sure that the monkeynhad reached his plateau,of spontaneous recovery,,we implanted his own cells.,So on the left side, you see the monkeynthat has spontaneously recovered.,He's at about 40 to 50 percentnof his previous performance,before the lesion.,He's not so accurate, not so quick.,And look now when we re-implant the cells:,Two months after re-implantation,nthe same individual. 
 (Applause) 
 It was also very exciting resultsnfor us, I tell you.,Since that time, we've understoodnmuch more about these cells.,We know that we can cryopreserve them,,we can use them later on.,We know that we can apply themnin other neuropathological models,,like Parkinson's disease, for example.,But our dream is stillnto implant them in humans.,And I really hope that I'll be ablento show you soon,that the human brain is giving usnthe tools to repair itself. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,,and I'm sure that right now, there arenseveral dozen people in the audience,,possibly even a majority,,who are thinking, "I knownsomebody who can use this.",I do, in any case.,And of course the question is,,what are the biggest obstacles,before you can goninto human clinical trials? 
 Jocelyne Bloch: The biggestnobstacles are regulations. (Laughs),So, from these exciting results,nyou need to fill out,about two kilograms of papers and forms,to be able to go through thesenkind of trials. 
 BG: Which is understandable,nthe brain is delicate, etc. 
 JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time,and a lot of patience and almostna professional team to do it, you know? 
 BG: If you project yourself --,having done the research,and having tried to getnpermission to start the trials,,if you project yourself out in time,,how many years beforensomebody gets into a hospital,and this therapy is available? 
 JB: So, it's very difficult to say.,It depends, first,non the approval of the trial.,Will the regulation allow usnto do it soon?,And then, you have to performnthis kind of study,in a small group of patients.,So it takes, already, a long timento select the patients,,do the treatment,and evaluate if it's usefulnto do this kind of treatment.,And then you have to deploynthis to a multicentric trial.,You have to really provenfirst that it's useful,before offering this treatmentnup for everybody. 
 BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course. 
 BG: Jocelyne, thank you for comingnto TED and sharing this.,BG: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I once said,,"If you want to liberate a society,,all you need is the Internet.",I was wrong. 
 I said those words back in 2011,,when a Facebook page I anonymously created,helped spark the Egyptian revolution.,The Arab Spring revealednsocial media's greatest potential,,but it also exposednits greatest shortcomings.,The same tool that united usnto topple dictators,eventually tore us apart.,I would like to share my own experiencenin using social media for activism,,and talk about some of the challengesnI have personally faced,and what we could do about them. 
 In the early 2000s,,Arabs were flooding the web.,Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,,for connecting with the restnof the people around the globe,,we escaped our frustratingnpolitical realities,and lived a virtual, alternative life.,Just like many of them,nI was completely apolitical until 2009.,At the time, when I loggedninto social media,,I started seeing more and more Egyptians,aspiring for political changenin the country.,It felt like I was not alone. 
 In June 2010,,Internet changed my life forever.,While browsing Facebook,,I saw a photo, a terrifying photo,nof a tortured, dead body,of a young Egyptian guy.,His name was Khaled Said.,Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandriannwho was killed by police.,I saw myself in his picture.,I thought, "I could be Khaled." 
 I could not sleep that night,nand I decided to do something.,I anonymously created a Facebook page,and called it "We are all Khaled Said.",In just three days, the pagenhad over 100,000 people,,fellow Egyptians who sharednthe same concern.,Whatever was happening had to stop. 
 I recruited my co-admin,nAbdelRahman Mansour.,We worked together for hours and hours.,We were crowdsourcingnideas from the people.,We were engaging them.,We were calling collectively for actions,,and sharing news that the regimendid not want Egyptians to know.,The page became the most followed page,in the Arab world.,It had more fans than establishednmedia organizations,and even top celebrities. 
 On January 14, 2011,,Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia,after mounting protestsnagainst his regime.,I saw a spark of hope.,Egyptians on social media were wondering,,"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?",I posted an eventnon Facebook and called it,"A Revolution against Corruption,nInjustice and Dictatorship.",I posed a question to the 300,000 usersnof the page at the time:,"Today is the 14th of January.,The 25th of January is Police Day.,It's a national holiday.,If 100,000 of us takento the streets of Cairo,,no one is going to stop us.,I wonder if we could do it." 
 In just a few days, the invitationnreached over a million people,,and over 100,000 peoplenconfirmed attendance.,Social media was crucialnfor this campaign.,It helped a decentralized movement arise.,It made people realizenthat they were not alone.,And it made it impossiblenfor the regime to stop it.,At the time, they didn'tneven understand it.,And on January 25th, Egyptians floodednthe streets of Cairo and other cities,,calling for change,,breaking the barrier of fear,and announcing a new era. 
 Then came the consequences.,A few hours before the regime cut offnthe Internet and telecommunications,,I was walking in a dark streetnin Cairo, around midnight.,I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.,The government must be planningna massacre tomorrow." 
 I was hit hard on my head.,I lost my balance and fell down,,to find four armed men surrounding me.,One covered my mouthnand the others paralyzed me.,I knew I was being kidnappednby state security. 
 I found myself in a cell,,handcuffed, blindfolded.,I was terrified.,So was my family,,who started looking for me,in hospitals, police stationsnand even morgues. 
 After my disappearance,,a few of my fellow colleagues who knewnI was the admin of the page,told the media aboutnmy connection with that page,,and that I was likely arrestednby state security.,My colleagues at Google startedna search campaign trying to find me,,and the fellow protesters in the squarendemanded my release. 
 After 11 days of complete darkness,,I was set free.,And three days later,,Mubarak was forced to step down.,It was the most inspiringnand empowering moment of my life.,It was a time of great hope.,Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 daysnduring the revolution.,They all shared the belief,that we could actually live togetherndespite our differences,,that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all. 
 But unfortunately,,the post-revolution eventsnwere like a punch in the gut.,The euphoria faded,,we failed to build consensus,,and the political strugglenled to intense polarization.,Social media only amplified that state,,by facilitating the spreadnof misinformation, rumors,,echo chambers and hate speech.,The environment was purely toxic.,My online world became a battlegroundnfilled with trolls, lies, hate speech.,I started to worrynabout the safety of my family.,But of course, this wasn't just about me.,The polarization reached its peaknbetween the two main powers --,the army supporters and the Islamists.,People in the center, like me,,started feeling helpless.,Both groups wanted you to side with them;,you were either with them or against them.,And on the 3rd of July 2013,,the army ousted Egypt's firstndemocratically elected president,,after three days of popular protestnthat demanded his resignation. 
 That day I made a very hard decision.,I decided to go silent, completely silent.,It was a moment of defeat.,I stayed silent for more than two years,,and I used the time to reflectnon everything that happened,,trying to understand why did it happen.,It became clear to me,that while it's true that polarizationnis primarily driven,by our human behavior,,social media shapes this behaviornand magnifies its impact.,Say you want to say somethingnthat is not based on a fact,,pick a fight or ignorensomeone that you don't like.,These are all natural human impulses,,but because of technology,,acting on these impulsesnis only one click away. 
 In my view, there are fivencritical challenges,facing today's social media. 
 First, we don't knownhow to deal with rumors.,Rumors that confirm people's biases,are now believed and spreadnamong millions of people. 
 Second, we create our own echo chambers.,We tend to only communicatenwith people that we agree with,,and thanks to social media,,we can mute, un-follownand block everybody else. 
 Third, online discussionsnquickly descend into angry mobs.,All of us probably know that.,It's as if we forget,that the people behind screensnare actually real people,and not just avatars. 
 And fourth, it became really hardnto change our opinions.,Because of the speednand brevity of social media,,we are forced to jump to conclusions,and write sharp opinions in 140 characters,about complex world affairs.,And once we do that,nit lives forever on the Internet,,and we are less motivatednto change these views,,even when new evidence arises. 
 Fifth -- and in my point of view,nthis is the most critical --,today, our social media experiencesnare designed in a way,that favors broadcasting over engagements,,posts over discussions,,shallow comments over deep conversations.,It's as if we agreed thatnwe are here to talk at each other,instead of talking with each other. 
 I witnessed how thesencritical challenges contributed,to an already polarizednEgyptian society,,but this is not just about Egypt.,Polarization is on the risenin the whole world.,We need to work hard on figuring out,how technology could benpart of the solution,,rather than part of the problem. 
 There's a lot of debate todaynon how to combat online harassment,and fight trolls.,This is so important.,No one could argue against that.,But we need to also think about hownto design social media experiences,that promote civilitynand reward thoughtfulness.,I know for a fact,if I write a postnthat is more sensational,,more one-sided, sometimesnangry and aggressive,,I get to have more people see that post.,I will get more attention. 
 But what if we put more focus on quality?,What is more important:,the total number of readersnof a post you write,,or who are the people who have impactnthat read what you write?,Couldn't we just give people morenincentives to engage in conversations,,rather than just broadcastingnopinions all the time?,Or reward people for reading,and responding to viewsnthat they disagree with?,And also, make it socially acceptablenthat we change our minds,,or probably even reward that?,What if we have a matrix that saysnhow many people changed their minds,,and that becomes partnof our social media experience?,If I could track how many peoplenare changing their minds,,I'd probably write morenthoughtfully, trying to do that,,rather than appealing to the peoplenwho already agree with me,and "liking" because I justnconfirmed their biases. 
 We also need to think about effectivencrowdsourcing mechanisms,,to fact-check widely spreadnonline information,,and reward people who take part in that.,In essence, we need to rethinkntoday's social media ecosystem,and redesign its experiences,to reward thoughtfulness, civilitynand mutual understanding. 
 As a believer in the Internet,nI teamed up with a few friends,,started a new project,,trying to find answersnand explore possibilities.,Our first product is a newnmedia platform for conversations.,We're hosting conversationsnthat promote mutual understanding,and hopefully change minds.,We don't claim to have the answers,,but we started experimentingnwith different discussions,about very divisive issues,,such as race, gun control,nthe refugee debate,,relationship between Islam and terrorism.,These are conversations that matter. 
 Today, at least one out of threenpeople on the planet,have access to the Internet.,But part of this Internetnis being held captive,by the less noble aspectsnof our human behavior. 
 Five years ago, I said,,"If you want to liberate society,,all you need is the Internet." 
 Today, I believe if we wantnto liberate society,,we first need to liberate the Internet. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Democracy.,In the West,,we make a colossal mistakentaking it for granted.,We see democracy,not as the most fragilenof flowers that it really is,,but we see it as partnof our society's furniture.,We tend to think of itnas an intransigent given.,We mistakenly believe that capitalismnbegets inevitably democracy.,It doesn't. 
 Singapore's Lee Kuan Yewnand his great imitators in Beijing,have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt,that it is perfectly possiblento have a flourishing capitalism,,spectacular growth,,while politics remains democracy-free.,Indeed, democracy is recedingnin our neck of the woods,,here in Europe. 
 Earlier this year,nwhile I was representing Greece --,the newly elected Greek government --,in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,,I was told in no uncertain termsnthat our nation's democratic process --,our elections --,could not be allowed to interfere,with economic policiesnthat were being implemented in Greece.,At that moment,,I felt that there could be no greaternvindication of Lee Kuan Yew,,or the Chinese Communist Party,,indeed of some recalcitrantnfriends of mine who kept telling me,that democracy would be bannednif it ever threatened to change anything. 
 Tonight, here, I want to present to you,an economic casenfor an authentic democracy.,I want to ask younto join me in believing again,that Lee Kuan Yew,,the Chinese Communist Party,and indeed the Eurogroup,are wrong in believingnthat we can dispense with democracy --,that we need an authentic,nboisterous democracy.,And without democracy,,our societies will be nastier,,our future bleak,and our great, new technologies wasted. 
 Speaking of waste,,allow me to point outnan interesting paradox,that is threateningnour economies as we speak.,I call it the twin peaks paradox.,One peak you understand --,you know it, you recognize it --,is the mountain of debtsnthat has been casting a long shadow,over the United States,nEurope, the whole world.,We all recognize the mountain of debts.,But few people discern its twin.,A mountain of idle cash,belonging to rich saversnand to corporations,,too terrified to invest it,into the productive activitiesnthat can generate the incomes,from which you can extinguishnthe mountain of debts,and which can produce all those thingsnthat humanity desperately needs,,like green energy. 
 Now let me give you two numbers.,Over the last three months,,in the United States,nin Britain and in the Eurozone,,we have invested, collectively,n3.4 trillion dollars,on all the wealth-producing goods --,things like industrial plants, machinery,,office blocks, schools,,roads, railways, machinery,nand so on and so forth.,$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money,until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion,that has been slushing aroundnin the same countries,,in our financial institutions,,doing absolutely nothingnduring the same period,except inflating stock exchangesnand bidding up house prices. 
 So a mountain of debtnand a mountain of idle cash,form twin peaks, nfailing to cancel each other out,through the normalnoperation of the markets. 
 The result is stagnant wages,,more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-oldsnin America, in Japan and in Europe,out of work.,And consequently, low aggregate demand,,which in a never-ending cycle,,reinforces the pessimism of the investors,,who, fearing low demand,nreproduce it by not investing --,exactly like Oedipus' father,,who, terrifiednby the prophecy of the oracle,that his son would grow up to kill him,,unwittingly engineered the conditions,that ensured that Oedipus,nhis son, would kill him. 
 This is my quarrel with capitalism.,Its gross wastefulness,,all this idle cash,,should be energized to improve lives,,to develop human talents,,and indeed to financenall these technologies,,green technologies,,which are absolutely essentialnfor saving planet Earth. 
 Am I right in believingnthat democracy might be the answer?,I believe so,,but before we move on,,what do we mean by democracy?,Aristotle defined democracy,as the constitutionnin which the free and the poor,,being in the majority, control government. 
 Now, of course Athenian democracynexcluded too many.,Women, migrants and,nof course, the slaves.,But it would be a mistake,to dismiss the significancenof ancient Athenian democracy,on the basis of whom it excluded. 
 What was more pertinent,,and continues to be sonabout ancient Athenian democracy,,was the inclusion of the working poor,,who not only acquirednthe right to free speech,,but more importantly, crucially,,they acquired the rightsnto political judgments,that were afforded equal weight,in the decision-makingnconcerning matters of state.,Now, of course, Athenianndemocracy didn't last long.,Like a candle that burns brightly,nit burned out quickly.,And indeed,,our liberal democracies todayndo not have their roots in ancient Athens.,They have their roots in the Magna Carta,,in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,,indeed in the American constitution.,Whereas Athenian democracynwas focusing on the masterless citizen,and empowering the working poor,,our liberal democracies are foundednon the Magna Carta tradition,,which was, after all,na charter for masters.,And indeed, liberal democracynonly surfaced when it was possible,to separate fully the political spherenfrom the economic sphere,,so as to confine the democratic processnfully in the political sphere,,leaving the economic sphere --,the corporate world, if you want --,as a democracy-free zone. 
 Now, in our democracies today,,this separation of the economicnfrom the political sphere,,the moment it started happening,,it gave rise to an inexorable,nepic struggle between the two,,with the economic spherencolonizing the political sphere,,eating into its power. 
 Have you wondered why politiciansnare not what they used to be?,It's not because their DNAnhas degenerated. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is rather because one can benin government today and not in power,,because power has migratednfrom the political to the economic sphere,,which is separate. 
 Indeed,,I spoke about my quarrelnwith capitalism.,If you think about it,,it is a little bit likena population of predators,,that are so successful in decimatingnthe prey that they must feed on,,that in the end they starve. 
 Similarly,,the economic sphere has been colonizingnand cannibalizing the political sphere,to such an extentnthat it is undermining itself,,causing economic crisis.,Corporate power is increasing,,political goods are devaluing,,inequality is rising,,aggregate demand is falling,and CEOs of corporations are too scarednto invest the cash of their corporations. 
 So the more capitalism succeedsnin taking the demos out of democracy,,the taller the twin peaks,and the greater the wastenof human resources,and humanity's wealth. 
 Clearly, if this is right,,we must reunite the politicalnand economic spheres,and better do itnwith a demos being in control,,like in ancient Athensnexcept without the slaves,or the exclusion of women and migrants. 
 Now, this is not an original idea.,The Marxist leftnhad that idea 100 years ago,and it didn't go very well, did it? 
 The lesson that we learnednfrom the Soviet debacle,is that only by a miraclenwill the working poor be reempowered,,as they were in ancient Athens,,without creating new formsnof brutality and waste. 
 But there is a solution:,eliminate the working poor.,Capitalism's doing it,by replacing low-wage workersnwith automata, androids, robots.,The problem is,that as long as the economicnand the political spheres are separate,,automation makes the twin peaks taller,,the waste loftier,and the social conflicts deeper,,including --,soon, I believe --,in places like China. 
 So we need to reconfigure,,we need to reunite the economicnand the political spheres,,but we'd better do itnby democratizing the reunified sphere,,lest we end up withna surveillance-mad hyperautocracy,that makes The Matrix, the movie,nlook like a documentary. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the question is notnwhether capitalism will survive,the technological innovationsnit is spawning.,The more interesting question,is whether capitalism will be succeedednby something resembling a Matrix dystopia,or something much closernto a Star Trek-like society,,where machines serve the humans,and the humans expend their energiesnexploring the universe,and indulging in long debatesnabout the meaning of life,in some ancient, Athenian-like,nhigh tech agora. 
 I think we can afford to be optimistic.,But what would it take,,what would it look like,to have this Star Trek-like utopia,ninstead of the Matrix-like dystopia? 
 In practical terms,,allow me to share just briefly,,a couple of examples. 
 At the level of the enterprise,,imagine a capital market,,where you earn capital as you work,,and where your capital follows younfrom one job to another,,from one company to another,,and the company --,whichever one you happennto work at at that time --,is solely owned by those who happennto work in it at that moment.,Then all income stemsnfrom capital, from profits,,and the very conceptnof wage labor becomes obsolete.,No more separation between thosenwho own but do not work in the company,and those who worknbut do not own the company;,no more tug-of-warnbetween capital and labor;,no great gap betweenninvestment and saving;,indeed, no towering twin peaks. 
 At the level of the globalnpolitical economy,,imagine for a moment,that our national currenciesnhave a free-floating exchange rate,,with a universal,nglobal, digital currency,,one that is issuednby the International Monetary Fund,,the G-20,,on behalf of all humanity.,And imagine further,that all international tradenis denominated in this currency --,let's call it "the cosmos,",in units of cosmos --,with every government agreeingnto be paying into a common fund,a sum of cosmos units proportionalnto the country's trade deficit,,or indeed to a country's trade surplus.,And imagine that that fund is utilizednto invest in green technologies,,especially in parts of the worldnwhere investment funding is scarce. 
 This is not a new idea.,It's what, effectively,nJohn Maynard Keynes proposed,in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.,The problem is,that back then, they didn't haventhe technology to implement it.,Now we do,,especially in the contextnof a reunified political-economic sphere. 
 The world that I am describing to you,is simultaneously libertarian,,in that it prioritizesnempowered individuals,,Marxist,,since it will have confinednto the dustbin of history,the division between capital and labor,,and Keynesian,,global Keynesian.,But above all else,,it is a world in which we will be ablento imagine an authentic democracy. 
 Will such a world dawn?,Or shall we descendninto a Matrix-like dystopia?,The answer lies in the political choicenthat we shall be making collectively.,It is our choice,,and we'd better make it democratically. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...,It was you who described yourselfnin your bios as a libertarian Marxist.,What is the relevancenof Marx's analysis today? 
 Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there wasnany relevance in what I just said,,then Marx is relevant.,Because the whole point of reunifyingnthe political and economic is --,if we don't do it,,then technological innovationnis going to create,such a massive fall in aggregate demand, 
 what Larry Summersnrefers to as secular stagnation.,With this crisis migratingnfrom one part of the world,,as it is now,,it will destabilizennot only our democracies,,but even the emerging world that is notnthat keen on liberal democracy.,So if this analysis holds water,nthen Marx is absolutely relevant.,But so is Hayek,,that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,,and so is Keynes,,so that's why I'm totally confused. 
 (Laughter) 
 BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 YV: If you are not confused,nyou are not thinking, OK? 
 BG: That's a very, very Greeknphilosopher kind of thing to say -- 
 YV: That was Einstein, actually -- 
 BG: During your talknyou mentioned Singapore and China,,and last night at the speaker dinner,,you expressed a pretty strong opinionnabout how the West looks at China.,Would you like to share that? 
 YV: Well, there's a greatndegree of hypocrisy.,In our liberal democracies,nwe have a semblance of democracy.,It's because we have confined,nas I was saying in my talk,,democracy to the political sphere,,while leaving the one spherenwhere all the action is --,the economic sphere --,a completely democracy-free zone. 
 In a sense,,if I am allowed to be provocative,,China today is closer to Britainnin the 19th century.,Because remember,,we tend to associatenliberalism with democracy --,that's a mistake, historically.,Liberalism, liberal,nit's like John Stuart Mill.,John Stuart Mill was particularlynskeptical about the democratic process.,So what you are seeing now in Chinanis a very similar process,to the one that we had in Britainnduring the Industrial Revolution,,especially the transitionnfrom the first to the second.,And to be castigating China,for doing that which the West didnin the 19th century,,smacks of hypocrisy. 
 BG: I am sure that many people herenare wondering about your experience,as the Finance Minister of Greecenearlier this year. 
 YV: I knew this was coming. 
 BG: Yes. 
 BG: Six months after,,how do you look backnat the first half of the year? 
 YV: Extremely exciting,nfrom a personal point of view,,and very disappointing,,because we had an opportunitynto reboot the Eurozone.,Not just Greece, the Eurozone.,To move away from the complacency,and the constant denialnthat there was a massive --,and there is a massivenarchitectural fault line,going through the Eurozone,,which is threatening, massively,nthe whole of the European Union process. 
 We had an opportunitynon the basis of the Greek program --,which by the way,,was the first programnto manifest that denial --,to put it right.,And, unfortunately,,the powers in the Eurozone,,in the Eurogroup,,chose to maintain denial. 
 But you know what happens.,This is the experiencenof the Soviet Union.,When you try to keep alive,an economic systemnthat architecturally cannot survive,,through political willnand through authoritarianism,,you may succeed in prolonging it,,but when change happens,it happens very abruptlynand catastrophically. 
 BG: What kind of changenare you foreseeing? 
 YV: Well, there's no doubt,that if we don't changenthe architecture of the Eurozone,,the Eurozone has no future. 
 BG: Did you make any mistakesnwhen you were Finance Minister? 
 YV: Every day. 
 BG: For example?nYV: Anybody who looks back -- 
 (Applause) 
 No, but seriously.,If there's any Minister of Finance,nor of anything else for that matter,,who tells you after six months in a job,,especially in such a stressful situation,,that they have made no mistake,nthey're dangerous people.,Of course I made mistakes. 
 The greatest mistakenwas to sign the application,for the extension of a loan agreement,in the end of February.,I was imagining,that there was a genuine interestnon the side of the creditors,to find common ground.,And there wasn't.,They were simply interestednin crushing our government,,just because they did not want,to have to deal withnthe architectural fault lines,that were running through the Eurozone.,And because they didn't want to admit,that for five years they were implementingna catastrophic program in Greece.,We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.,This is worse than the Great Depression.,And no one has come clean,from the troika of lendersnthat have been imposing this policy,to say, "This was a colossal mistake." 
 BG: Despite all this,,and despite the aggressivenessnof the discussion,,you seem to be remainingnquite pro-European. 
 YV: Absolutely.,Look, my criticismnof the European Union and the Eurozone,comes from a personnwho lives and breathes Europe.,My greatest fear is thatnthe Eurozone will not survive.,Because if it doesn't,,the centrifugal forcesnthat will be unleashed,will be demonic,,and they will destroy the European Union.,And that will be catastrophicnnot just for Europe,but for the whole global economy. 
 We are probably the largestneconomy in the world.,And if we allow ourselves,to fall into a routenof the postmodern 1930's,,which seems to me to be what we are doing,,then that will be detrimental,to the future of Europeansnand non-Europeans alike. 
 BG: We definitely hopenyou are wrong on that point.,Yanis, thank you for coming to TED. 
 YV: Thank you. 
 (Applause)
