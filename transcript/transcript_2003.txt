Right when I was 15 was whennI first got interested in solar energy.,My family had moved from Fort Lee,nNew Jersey to California,,from the snow to lots of heat,nand gas lines.,There was gas rationing in 1973.,The energy crisis was in full bore. 
 I started readingn"Popular Science" magazine,,and I got really excitednabout the potential of solar energy,to try and solve that crisis.,I had just takenntrigonometry in high school,,I learned about the parabola,and how it could concentratenrays of light to a single focus.,That got me very excited.,And I really feltnthat there would be potential,to build some kind of thingnthat could concentrate light.,So, I started this companyncalled Solar Devices.,And this was a companynwhere I built parabolas,,I took metal shop,,and I remember walking into metal shopnbuilding parabolas and Stirling engines.,And I was building a Stirling enginenover on the lathe,,and all the motorcycle guys said,n"You're building a bong, aren't you?",And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine."nBut they didn't believe me. 
 I sold the plans for this engine,and for this dish in the backnof "Popular Science" magazine,,for four dollars each.,And I earned enough moneynto pay for my first year of Caltech.,It was a really big excitement for mento get into Caltech.,And at my first year at Caltech,nI continued the business.,But then, in the second year of Caltech,nthey started grading.,The whole first year was pass/fail,nbut the second year was graded.,I wasn't able to keep upnwith the business,,and I ended up with a 25-year detour.,My dream had been to convert solar energynat a very practical cost,,but then I had this big detour.,First, the coursework at Caltech.,Then, when I graduated from Caltech,nthe IBM PC came out,,and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981. 
 And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,,and I was completely blown awaynby Lotus 1-2-3.,I began operating my business with 1-2-3,nbegan writing add-ins for 1-2-3,,wrote a natural languageninterface to 1-2-3.,I started an educational software companynafter I joined Lotus,,and then I started Idealabnso I could have a roof,under which I could buildnmultiple companies in succession. 
 Much later -- in 2000, very recently --nthe new California energy crisis --,what was purported to bena big energy crisis -- was coming.,And I was trying to figure out,if we could build somethingnthat would capitalize on that,and get people backup energy,nin case the crisis really came.,And I started looking at hownwe could build battery backup systems,that could give people five hours,n10 hours, maybe even a full day,,or three days' worth of backup power.,I'm glad you heard earlier today,nbatteries are unbelievably --,lack density compared to fuel.,So much more energy can be storednwith fuel than with batteries.,You'd have to fill your entirenparking space of one garage space,just to give yourselfnfour hours of battery backup.,And I concluded, after researchingnevery other technology,that we could deploy for storing energy --,flywheels, differentnformulations of batteries --,it just wasn't practical to store energy.,So what about making energy?nMaybe we could make energy. 
 I tried to figure out --nmaybe solar's become attractive.,It's been 25 years since I was doing this,,let me go back and looknat what's been happening with solar cells.,And the price had gone downnfrom 10 dollars a watt,to about four or five dollars a watt,nbut it stabilized.,And it needed to get much lowernto be cost-effective.,I studied all the new thingsnthat had happened in solar cells,,and was looking for ways we couldnmake solar cells more inexpensively.,A lot of new thingsnare happening to do that,,but fundamentally, the processnrequires a tremendous amount of energy.,Some people say it takesnmore energy to make a solar cell,than it will give out in its entire life.,If we reduce the amount of energynit takes to make the cells,,that will become more practical. 
 But right now, you pretty muchnhave to take silicon,,put it in an oven at 1600 Fnfor 17 hours, to make the cells.,A lot of people are workingnto try and reduce that,,but I didn't have anything to contribute.,So I tried to figure outnwhat other way could we try,to make cost-effective solar electricity.,What if we collect the sunnwith a large reflector --,like I had been thinking aboutnin high school,,but maybe with modern technologynwe could make it cheaper --,concentrate it to a small converter,,and then the conversion devicenwouldn't have to be as expensive,,because it's much smaller,nrather than solar cells,,which have to cover the entire surfacenthat you want to gather sun from. 
 This seemed practical now,,because a lot of new technologiesnhad come in the 25 years,since I had last looked at it.,There was a lotnof new manufacturing techniques,,not to mention really cheapnminiature motors --,brushless motors,nservomotors, stepper motors,,that are used in printers and scanners.,So, that's a breakthrough.,Of course, inexpensive microprocessors,and a very important breakthrough --ngenetic algorithms. 
 I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.,It's a powerful way of solving intractablenproblems using natural selection.,You take a problem that you can't solvenwith a pure mathematical answer,,you build an evolutionary systemnto try multiple tries at guessing,,you add sex --,where you take half of one solutionnand half of another,and then make new mutations --,and you use natural selectionnto kill off not-as-good solutions. 
 Usually, with a genetic algorithmnon a computer today,,with a three gigahertz processor,,you can solve manynformerly intractable problems,in just a matter of minutes.,So we tried to come up with a waynto use genetic algorithms,to create a new type of concentrator.,And I'll show you what we came up with. 
 Traditionally,nconcentrators look like this.,Those shapes are parabolas.,They take all the parallel incoming raysnand focus it to a single spot.,They have to track the sun,,because they have to pointndirectly at the sun.,They usually havena one degree acceptance angle --,once they're more than a degree off,,none of the sunlight raysnwill hit the focus.,So we tried to come upnwith a non-tracking collector,that would gather much more thannone degree of light, with no moving parts.,So we created a genetic algorithmnto try this out,,we made a model in Excelnof a multisurface reflector,,and an amazing thing evolved, literally,,from trying a billion cycles,na billion different attempts,,with a fitness function that definednhow can you collect the most light,,from the most angles,nover a day, from the sun. 
 And this is the shape that evolved.,It's this non-tracking collectornwith these six tuba-like horns,,and each of them collect lightnin the following way --,if the sunlight strikes right here,,it might bounce right to the center,nthe hot spot, directly,,but if the sun is off axisnand comes from the side,,it might hit two placesnand take two bounces.,So for direct light,nit takes only one bounce,,for off-axis light it might take two,,and for extreme off-axis,nit might take three.,Your efficiency goes downnwith more bounces,,because you lose about 10 percentnwith each bounce,,but this allowed us to collect lightnfrom a plus or minus 25-degree angle.,So, about two and a half hours of the day,we could collectnwith a stationary component. 
 Solar cells collect lightnfor four and a half hours though.,On an average adjusted day,na solar cell --,because the sun's moving across the sky,,the solar cell is going downnwith a sine wave function of performance,at the off-axis angles.,It collects about four and a halfnaverage hours of sunlight a day.,So even this, although it was greatnwith no moving parts --,we could achieve highntemperatures -- wasn't enough. 
 We needed to beat solar cells.,So we took a look at another idea.,We looked at a way to break up a parabolaninto individual petals that would track.,So what you see here is 12 separate petals,that each could be controllednwith individual microprocessors,that would only cost a dollar.,You can buy a two-megahertznmicroprocessor for a dollar now.,And you can buy stepper motorsnthat pretty much never wear out,because they have no brushes,,for a dollar.,So we can control all 12 of these petalsnfor under 50 dollars,and what this would allow us to donis not have to move the focus any more,,but only move the petals. 
 The whole system would havena much lower profile,,but also we could gather sunlightnfor six and a half to seven hours a day.,Now that we have concentrated sunlight,,what are we going to put at the centernto convert sunlight to electricity?,So we tried to looknat all the different heat engines,that have been used in history to convertnsunlight or heat to electricity,,And one of the great ones of all time,,James Watt's steam engine of 1788nwas a major breakthrough.,James Watt didn't actually inventnthe steam engine, he just refined it.,But his refinements were incredible.,He added new linearnmotion guides to the pistons,,he added a condensernto cool the steam outside the cylinder,,he made the engine double-acting,nso it had double the power. 
 Those were major breakthroughs.nAll of the improvements he made --,and it's justifiablenthat our measure of energy, the watt,,today is named after him.,So we looked at this engine,nand this had some potential.,Steam engines are dangerous,,and they had tremendous impactnon the world --,industrial revolutionnand ships and locomotives.,But they're usually good to be large,,so they're not goodnfor distributed power generation.,They're also very high-pressure,nso they're dangerous. 
 Another type of enginenis the hot air engine.,And the hot air enginenalso was not invented by Robert Stirling,,but Robert Stirling came along in 1816nand radically improved it.,This engine, because it wasnso interesting --,it only worked on air, no steam --,has led to hundredsnof creative designs over the years,that use the Stirling engine principle. 
 But after the Stirling engine,nOtto came along,,and also, he didn't inventnthe internal combustion engine,,he just refined it.,He showed it in Paris in 1867,nand it was a major achievement,because it brought the power densitynof the engine way up.,You could now get a lot more powernin a lot smaller space,,and that allowed the enginento be used for mobile applications.,So, once you have mobility,,you're making a lot of enginesnbecause you've got lots of units,,as opposed to steam shipsnor big factories,,so this was the engine that ended upnbenefiting from mass production,where all the other engines didn't. 
 So, because it went into mass production,,costs were reduced,n100 years of refinement,,emissions were reduced,ntremendous production value.,There have been hundreds of millionsnof internal combustion engines built,,compared to thousandsnof Stirling engines built.,And not nearly as manynsmall steam engines being built anymore,,only large ones for big operations.,So after lookingnat these three, and 47 others,,we concluded that the Stirling enginenwould be the best one to use.,I want to give you a brief explanationnof how we looked at it and how it works. 
 So we tried to looknat the Stirling engine in a new way,,because it was practical --,weight no longer matterednfor our application.,The internal combustion enginentook off because weight mattered,,because you were moving around.,But if you're trying to generatensolar energy in a static place,the weight doesn't matter so much. 
 We also discovered that efficiencyndoesn't matter so much,if your energy source is free.,Normally, efficiency is crucial,because the fuel costnof your engine over its life,dwarfs the cost of the engine.,But if your fuel source is free,,then the only thing that matters,is the up-frontncapital cost of the engine.,So you don't wantnto optimize for efficiency,,you want to optimize for power per dollar. 
 So using that new twist,nwith the new criteria,,we thought we couldnrelook at the Stirling engine,,and also bring genetic algorithms in.,Basically, Robert Stirlingndidn't have Gordon Moore before him,to get us three gigahertznof processor power.,So we took the same genetic algorithm,that we used earliernto make that concentrator,,which didn't work out for us,,to optimize the Stirling engine,,and make its design sizesnand all of its dimensions,the exact optimumnto get the most power per dollar,,irrespective of weight,nirrespective of size,,just to get the most conversionnof solar energy,,because the sun is free.,And that's the process we took --nlet me show you how the engine works. 
 The simplest heat engine,nor hot air engine, of all time,would be this -- take a box,na steel canister, with a piston.,Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.,Take it off the flamenand pour water on it, or let it cool down,,the piston moves down.,That's a heat engine.,That's the most fundamentalnheat engine you could have.,The problem is the efficiencynis one hundredth of one percent,,because you're heatingnall the metal of the chamber,and then cooling all the metalnof the chamber each time.,And you're only getting power from the airnthat's heating at the same time,,but you're wasting energynheating and cooling the metal. 
 So someone came upnwith a very clever idea.,Instead of heating and coolingnthe whole cylinder,,what about if you putna displacer inside --,a little thing that shuttlesnthe air back and forth.,You move that up and downnwith a little bit of energy,but now you're only shifting the air downnto the hot end and up to the cold end.,So, now you're not alternately heatingnand cooling the metal, just the air.,That allows you to get the efficiency up,from a hundredth of a percentnto about two percent. 
 And then Robert Stirlingncame along with this genius idea,,which was, well, I'm stillnnot heating the metal now,,with this kind of engine,,but I'm still reheating all the air.,I'm still heating the air every timenand cooling the air every time.,What about if I putna thermal sponge in the middle,,in the passageway between where the airnhas to move between hot and cold?,So he made fine wires, and cracked glass,,and all different kinds of materialsnto be a heat sponge.,So when the air pushes upnto go from the hot end to the cold end,,it puts some heat into the sponge.,And then when the air comes backnafter it's been cooled,,it picks up that heat again.,So you're reusing your energynfive or six times,,and that brings the efficiencynup to between 30 and 40 percent.,It's a little known, but brilliant,ngenius invention of Robert Stirling,that takes the hot air enginenfrom being somewhat impractical --,like I found out when I madenthe real simple version in high school --,to very potentially possible,,once you get the efficiency up,,if you can design thisnto be low enough cost. 
 So we really set out on a pathnto try and make the lowest cost possible.,We built a huge mathematical modelnof how a Stirling engine works.,We applied the genetic algorithm.,We got the results from thatnfor the optimal engine.,We built engines --,so we built 100 different enginesnover the last two years.,We measured each one, we readjustednthe model to what we measured,,and then we led thatnto the current prototype.,It led to a very compact,ninexpensive engine,,and this is what the engine looks like. 
 Let me show younwhat it looks like in real life.,So this is the engine.nIt's just a small cylinder down here,,which holds the generatorninside and all the linkage,,and it's the hot cap --nthe hot cylinder on the top --,this part gets hot, this part is cool,,and electricity comes out.,The exact converse is also true.,If you put electricity in,nthis will get hot and this will get cold,,you get refrigeration.,So it's a complete reversible cycle,,a very efficient cycle,nand quite a simple thing to make.,So now you put the two things together. 
 So you have the engine.,What if you combinenthe petals and the engine in the center?,The petals track and the enginengets the concentrated sunlight,,takes that heatnand turns it into electricity.,This is what the first prototypenof our system looked like,with the petalsnand the engine in the center.,This is being run out in the sun,,and now I want to show younwhat the actual thing looks like. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So this is a unit with the 12 petals.,These petals cost about a dollar each --,they're lightweight,ninjection-molded plastic, aluminized.,The mechanism to controlneach petal is below there,,with a microprocessor on each one.,There are thermocouples on the engine --,little sensors that detect the heatnwhen the sunlight strikes them.,Each petal adjusts itself separatelynto keep the highest temperature on it.,When the sun comes out in the morning,nthe petals will seek the sun,,find it by searchingnfor the highest temperature.,About a minute and a half or two minutesnafter the rays are striking the hot cap,the engine will be warm enough to start,and then the enginenwill generate electricity,for about six and a half hours a day --,six and a half to seven hoursnas the sun moves across the sky. 
 A critical partnthat we can take advantage of,is that we have theseninexpensive microprocessors,and each of these petals is autonomous,,and each of these petals figures outnwhere the sun is with no user setup.,So you don't have to tellnwhat latitude, longitude you're at,,what your roof slope angle is,nor what orientation.,It doesn't really care.,What it does is it searchesnto find the hottest spot,,it searches again a half an hour later,na day later, a month later.,It basically figures outnwhere on Earth you are,by watching the direction the sun moves,,so you don't have tonactually enter anything about that. 
 The way the unit works is,,when the sun comes out,nthe engine will start,and you get power out here.,We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,,so that could be usednfor certain applications.,We have an inverter in there,nso you get 117 volts AC.,And you also get hot water.nThe hot water's optional.,You don't have to use it,nit will cool itself.,But you can use itnto optionally heat hot water,and that bringsnthe efficiency up even higher,because some of the heatnthat you'd normally be rejecting,,you can now use as useful energy,nwhether it's for a pool or hot water. 
 Let me show you a quick movienof what this looks like running.,This is the first testnwhere we took it outside,and each of the petalsnwere individually seeking.,And what they do is step,nvery coarsely at first,,and very finely afterward.,Once they get a temperature readingnon the thermocouple,indicating they found the sun,,they slow down and do a fine search.,Then the petals will move into position,nand the engine will start. 
 We've been working on thisnfor the last two years.,We're very excited about the progress,nwe have a long way to go though.,This is how we envisionnit would be in a residential installation:,you'd probably havenmore than one unit on your roof.,It could be on your roof,nyour backyard, or somewhere else.,You don't have to have enough unitsnto power your entire house,,you just save moneynwith each incremental one you add. 
 So you're still usingnthe grid potentially,,in this type of application,nto be your backup supply --,of course, you can't use these at night,nand you can't use these on cloudy days.,But by reducing your energy use,npretty much at the peak times --,usually when you havenyour air conditioning on,,or other times like that --,this generates the peak powernat the peak usage time,,so it's very complementary in that sense. 
 This is how we would envisionna residential application.,We also think there'snvery big potential for energy farms,,especially in remote landnwhere there happens to be a lot of sun.,It's a really good combinationnof those two factors.,It turns out there's a lot of powerful sunnall around the world, obviously,,but in special places,where it happens to benrelatively inexpensive to place these,and also in many more placesnwhere there is high wind power.,So an example of that is,nhere's the map of the United States.,Pretty much everywhere that'snnot green or blue is a really ideal place,,but even the green or blue areas are good,,just not as good as the placesnthat are red, orange and yellow.,But the hot spot right around Las Vegasnand Death Valley is very good.,And is only affects the payback period,,it doesn't mean that youncouldn't use solar energy;,you could use it anywhere on Earth.,It just affects the payback period,if you're comparingnto grid-supplied electricity.,But if you don't havengrid-supplied electricity,,then the question of paybacknis a different one entirely.,It's just how many wattsndo you get per dollar,,and how could you benefit from thatnto change your life in some way. 
 This is the map of the whole Earth,,and you can seena huge swathe in the middle,where a large part of the population is,,there's tremendous chancesnfor solar energy.,And of course, look at Africa.,The potential to take advantagenof solar energy there is unbelievable,,and I'm really excited to talk morenabout finding ways we can help with that. 
 So, in conclusion, I would saynmy journey has shown me,that you can revisitnold ideas in a new light,,and sometimes ideasnthat have been discarded in the past,can be practical now if you applynsome new technology or new twists.,We believe we're getting very closento something practical and affordable.,Our short-term goal for thisnis to be half the price of solar cells,and our longer-term goalnis to be less than a five-year payback.,And at less than a five-year payback,nthis becomes very economic.,So you don't have to just havena feel-good attitude about energy,to want to have one of these.,It just makes economic sense.,Right now, solar paybacksnare between 30 and 50 years.,If you get it down below five years,,then it's almost a no-brainernbecause the interest to own it --,someone else will finance it for younand you can just make money from day one.,So that's our real powerful goal,that we're reallynshooting for in the company. 
 Two other things that I learnednthat were very surprising to me --,one was how casual we are about energy.,I was walking from the elevator over here,,and even just lookingnat the stage right now --,so there's probablyn20,500-watt lights right now.,There's 10,000 watts of lightnpouring on the stage,,one horsepowernis 746 watts, at full power.,So there's basically 15 horses runningnat full speed just to keep the stage lit.,Not to mention the 200 horsesnthat are probably running right now,to keep the air-conditioning going.,And it's just amazing,,walk in the elevator,nand there's lights on in the elevator.,Of course, now I'm very sensitive at homenwhen we leave the lights on by mistake. 
 But, everywhere around usnwe have insatiable use for energy,because it's so cheap.,And it's cheap becausenwe've been subsidized by energy,that's been concentrated by the sun.,Basically, oil isnsolar-energy concentrate.,It's been pounded for a billion yearsnwith a lot of energy,to make it have all that energyncontained in it.,And we don't have a birthright,to just use that upnas fast as we are, I think.,And it would be great if we couldnmake our energy usage renewable,,where as we're using the energy,nwe're creating it at the same pace,,and I really hope we can get there. 
 Thank you very much,nyou've been a great audience.I had requested slides,,kind of adamantly,,up till the -- pretty much, last few days,,but was denied access to a slide projector.,(Laughter),I actually find them a lot more emotional --,(Laughter),-- and personal,,and the neat thing about a slide projector,is you can actually focus the work,,unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.,Now, I agree that,you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions,and, you know, if you use a slide projector,,you're not able to have the bad type,swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,,but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,,to trade that off for a focus.,(Laughter),It's a thought. Just a thought.,And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.,And the thing you really hope for,is occasionally they burn up,,which we won't see tonight. So. 
 With that, let's get the first slide up here.,This, as many of you have probably guessed,,is a,recently emptied beer can in Portugal.,(Laughter),This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,,and I thought --,you know, fly all night, I looked up,,and I thought, wow, how clean.,You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.,I mean, how nice is that?,Everything's gotten simpler in design,,and here's this mega airport,,and God, I just -- I took a picture.,I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.,Till a couple months later,,I went back to the same airport --,same plane, I think -- and looked up,,and it said C.,(Laughter),It was only then that I realized,it was simply a gate that I was coming into.,(Laughter) 
 I'm a big believer in the emotion of design,,and the message that's sent,before somebody begins to read,,before they get the rest of the information;,what is the emotional response they get to the product,,to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.,That area of design interests me the most,,and I think this for me is a real clear,,very simplified version,of what I'm talking about.,These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,,situated next to each other.,So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.,You know, it's pretty clear.,Take a look at the second door and see,if there's any different message.,O.K., which one would you park in front of?,(Laughter),Same color, same message, same words.,The only thing that's different,is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece --,and, again,,which is the psycho-killer here?,(Laughter),Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.,I would probably park in front of the other one. 
 I'm sure a lot of you are aware,that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last,five years or so.,It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of,come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.,But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,,and was very happy to,see that apparently this idea of minimalism,has even been translated by the graffiti artist.,(Laughter),And this graffiti artist has come along,,made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.,(Laughter),He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.,(Laughter) 
 This is for a book by "Metropolis.",I took some photos, and this is,a billboard in Florida,,and either they hadn't paid their rent,,or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,,and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,,so they just teared out sections of it.,And I would argue that it's possibly more effective,than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,,getting you to look over that way.,And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's. 
 This is from my second book.,The first book is called, "The End of Print,",and it was done along with a film,,working with William Burroughs.,And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.,(Laughter),When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,,he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.,And I said, well, that's fine;,I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,,and he finally agreed to it.,And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice,that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,,"I remember attending an exhibition called,,'Photography: The End of Painting.'",And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all.",So, apparently when photography was perfected,,there were people going around saying,,that's it: you've just ruined painting.,People are just going to take pictures now.,And of course, that wasn't the case. 
 So, this is from "2nd Sight,",a book I did on intuition.,I think it's not the only ingredient in design,,but possibly the most important.,It's something everybody has.,It's not a matter of teaching it;,in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition,as an ingredient of your working process,because they can't quantify it:,it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,,but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card,or a newsletter.,So it tends to get discounted.,This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,,"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.,There comes a leap in consciousness --,call it intuition or what you will --,and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why.",So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?,And the more you try to think about it,,the further the answer gets from you,,and the minute you stop thinking about it,,your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense. 
 I like this for a couple of reasons.,If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.,I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.,"Don't mistake legibility for communication.",Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.,More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.,So, what is the message sent before,somebody actually gets into the material?,And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area. 
 This is working with Marshall McLuhan.,I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,,and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall,that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,,predicting so much of what has happened,in the advertising, television, media world.,And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.,And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before,,and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.,So, this was the contents page originally.,When I got done it was 540 pages,,and then the publisher, Gingko Press,,ended up cutting it down considerably:,it's just under 400 pages now.,But I decided I liked this contents page --,I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.,(Laughter),It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,,but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.,(Laughter) 
 So, a couple spreads from the book:,here McLuhan says,,"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature.","The invention of printing did away with anonymity,,fostering ideas of literary fame,and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,",which had never been done before printing.,"When new technologies impose themselves,on societies long habituated to older technologies,,anxieties of all kinds result.","While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,,they always form vivid images of the preceding world.",I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.,(Laughter),(Applause),"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,,and no possible occupation except information gathering.",That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off. 
 So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.,And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,,and it was done right after 9/11.,And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter,in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA,that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.,(Laughter),There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.,And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,,and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system.",I was, O.K.; that's fine.,I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,,and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.,And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,,and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.,And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?,You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.,But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,,and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,,and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So. 
 This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,,where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence,and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.,So, this is a six-shot sequence.,I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.,And then the tiny line of copy says,,If you want to see this entire sequence --,how this whole ride was -- go to the website.,And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site,to get this entire picture.,Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.,(Laughter),I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself. 
 This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment --,asked me to do these posters.,They were wild-posted around New York City.,You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all --,but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.,It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But --,(Laughter),(Applause),-- but I did.,These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,,and there were definitely some heads turning,,you know, people smoking and, "Huh!",(Laughter),And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.,It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;,it looked like they might be real. Anyway.

 This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.,I was in the Caribbean at Christmas,,and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell --,not that they will sell --,that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.,This was either an old product with new packaging,,or a brand-new package, and I just thought,,Yikes! How's that still happening? 
 I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,,and this particular assignment was,to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.,(Laughter),I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.,The students actually cut them up,and put them up around bars and restaurants that night,,and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...,(Laughter) 
 I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.,It was a worldwide branding campaign.,And it was interesting to me --,my background is in sociology; I had no design training,,and sometimes people say, well, that explains it --,but it was a very interesting experiment,because there's no product that I had to sell;,it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.,They thought some people didn't like them.,(Laughter),I found out that's very true,,working on this campaign worldwide. 
 And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,,and what I did was add type and people to the ad,,which the previous campaign had not had,,and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.,And we were trying to say that,,hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;,some of them actually have friends and family,,and they're not all awful people.,And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday.",So, we tried to take this --,what was perceived as a negative:,their over-competitiveness, their,,you know, long working hours --,and turn it into a positive and not run from it.,You know: Thank God it's Monday --,I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,,and hear everybody else's conversations f,or 10 hours and then go home. 
 But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,,because they were all elaborately art-directed,,and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.,It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.,And this is how the ad ran around the world.,In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me --,nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies --,but see if you can tell the difference.,This is how the ad ran throughout the world;,Germany made one slight change in the ad.,(Laughter) 
 Now, there's kind of two issues here.,If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.,(Laughter),I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.,He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...,(Laughter),And then as the agency explained to me, they said,,"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;,why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?",So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;,I think it's a very small-minded approach,,the world is certainly much more global,,and I certainly think the people of Germany,could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,,though we'll never know. 
 This is some work from Ray Gun.,And the point of this magazine was to read the articles,,listen to the music, and try to interpret it.,There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.,This is an opener for Brian Eno,,and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.,This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.,There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun.",And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.,(Laughter) 
 Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article --,so I set the whole article in Dingbat.,(Laughter),You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:,it is the actual article.,I suppose you could eventually decode it,,but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.,(Laughter) 
 Having done a lot of magazines,,I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,,and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.,And I was basically pretty disappointed,to see that they had,chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,,which was basically the moment of impact.,And People magazine, I thought,,got probably the best shot.,It's kind of horsey type, but the texture --,the second plane not quite hitting:,there was something more enticing,,if that's the right -- it's not the right word --,but in this cover than Time or Newsweek. 
 But when I got into this magazine,,there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.,On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.,And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.,The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.,Look at the image of this lady --,who knows what she's going through? --,and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps.",Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's --,unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread. 
 And this continued through the entire magazine.,It did not let up.,This says: "One clean fits all." .,There were a lot of orphans made this day,,and here's a dead body being brought out.,It just seems to me possibly even a blank page,would have been more appropriate.,And this one I think is possibly the worst:,two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.,One -- who knows what she's going through;,the other one is worried about model behavior and milk. 
 And --,I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,,and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that --,they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk,,and when they got back to their car,,they found a note on their car that made them think,maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event --,it had been a few months.,This was what they found on their car.,(Laughter),There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,,but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back. 
 This is my desktop.,Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders,,but I don't know what they are.,These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.,We are wrapping up. 
 This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.,I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,,because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,,you can now get a plate in the keyboard,,so there's no more faking it --,that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.,Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient,to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...,I'm just not sure this is improvement. 
 If you ever doubt the power of graphic design,,this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.,And this to me is an extreme case,of the power of emotion, of graphic design,,even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time. 
 What's next? What's next is going to be people.,As we get more technically driven,,the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.,You have to utilize who you are in your work.,Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,,from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.,If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,,and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well. 
 This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,,and I thought this was a great example of both.,This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.,It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly --,that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.,(Laughter),But more importantly,,she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.,And I'm thinking, yeah, right,,I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.,I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,,and you get charged by this thing and you go,,oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.,(Laughter),I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.,(Laughter) 
 But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.,And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk,about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.,And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,,who was a test pilot, and he told me that,when you signed up to become a test pilot,,they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance,of death on the job.,That's pretty high for most occupations.,(Laughter),But, you know, the government would make a plane;,they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?,Some of them did; some of them didn't. 
 And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make,between, like, serif versus san-serif.,(Laughter),And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.,Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?,Why not put some of yourself into the work?,And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,,What's the definition of a good job?,And as teachers, after you get all the answers,,you like to give them the correct answer.,And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this --,the definition of a good job is:,If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue --,would you be doing that same work?,And if you would, you've got a great job.,And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?,You're going to be dead a really long time.,Thank you very much.I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.,And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations,interact to create the behavior of the whole organization.,So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,,and there are many others. The web is one.,There are many biological systems like that --,brains, cells, developing embryos. 
 There are about 10,000 species of ants.,They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,,and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.,And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.,Nobody tells anybody what to do.,The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.,No ant directs the behavior of any other ant.,And I try to figure out how that works.,And I've been working for the past 20 years,on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona. 
 Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,,and the rabbit just happens to be there.,And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.,This is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.,And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,,gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.,And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.,This is just a road. And it's not very big:,it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.,And every colony has a name, which is a number,,which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year,and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,,and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.,And by doing this I know how old they all are.,And because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes,as the colony gets older and larger. 
 So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.,Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.,And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives --,those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight.,So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens --,each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,,and they all fly to a common place. And they mate.,And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.,And she's in the process of mating with this male,,and there's another male on top waiting his turn.,Often the queens mate more than once.,And after that, the males all die. That's it for them. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,,dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.,And they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs,using the sperm from that original mating.,So the queen goes down in there.,She lays eggs, she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.,She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.,Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge,,they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.,They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,,and the queen never comes out again. 
 So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.,There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.,So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.,This is a three-year-old colony.,There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.,They make a midden, a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.,This is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.,This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.,And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes --,so this is about 10,000 worker ants --,changes as a function of colony age, in years.,So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,,and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.,And it stays that size until the queen dies,and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.,And it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,,that they start to reproduce.,That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.,And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age,because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter),So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting. 
 (Laughter) 
 Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.,That's not just how is the colony organized,,but how does it change what it's doing?,How is it that the colony manages to adjust,the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?,So, things happen to an ant colony.,When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.,There's a lot of damage to the nest,,and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.,When extra food becomes available --,and this is what everybody knows about picnics --,then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.,So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that,the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?,And that's the process that I call task allocation. 
 And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks,of the ants I see just outside the nest,into these four categories: where an ant is foraging,,when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.,The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass --,are an interesting group that go out early in the morning,before the foragers are active.,They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,,and by coming back -- just by making it back --,they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.,Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,,and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.,That is, that there are chambers inside,,they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil,and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.,It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings,of the Hopi people that are in that area.,And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,,and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.,So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,,put it down, turn around, and go back in.,And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.,So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.,On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day,they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.,So that's what the midden workers do.,And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.,So that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants. 
 So, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.,And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep,as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.,And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,,after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.,I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe,and my crew of students with pickaxes,,but instead because when there's flooding,,occasionally the colony has to go down deep.,So there's this whole network of chambers.,The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.,There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.,And this is true of most ants --,that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.,They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.,When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,,and other ants come up from below, get the food,,bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.,There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.,And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time,about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.,So, despite what it says in the Bible,,about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,",in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.,That is to say, if something happened -- and I've never seen anything like this happen,,but I've only been looking for 20 years --,if something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.,But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there. 
 And I think it's a very interesting question --,what is there about the way the colony is organized,that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?,And they sort of stand as a buffer in between,the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.,And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,,you never see them deep down.,So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.,They somehow get into this reserve.,And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.,And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.,Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well.,They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,,but they mostly work by smell.,So just to reinforce that what you might have thought,about ant queens isn't true --,you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence,to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers,to tell the ants outside what to do,,there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see,the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.,So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony. 
 So when I first set out to work on task allocation,,my first question was, "What's the relationship,between the ants doing different tasks?,Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?,Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?",And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant,was somehow dedicated to its task from birth,and sort of performed independently of the others,,knowing its place on the assembly line.,And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?" 
 So I did experiments where I changed one thing.,So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers,by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,,early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.,This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.,Here it is about 40 minutes later.,And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks,to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.,And what I wanted to know was, "OK,,here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited --,is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?",Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.,So here's some blue nest maintenance workers.,And lately we've gotten more sophisticated,and we have this three-color system.,And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.,We started out with model airplane paint,and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,,and they work really well.,And so just to summarize the result,,well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.,So, if I change the numbers performing one task,,it changes the numbers performing another.,So for example, if I make a mess,that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,,then I see fewer ants out foraging.,And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks. 
 And the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,,was that ants actually switch tasks.,The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.,So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else --,the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,,they become foragers.,The nest maintenance workers become foragers.,The patrollers become foragers.,But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.,Like I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,,the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.,If there's more patrolling to do --,so I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed --,the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.,But if more nest maintenance work is needed --,for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks --,then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance,,they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.,So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.,And finally, it looks like each ant is deciding,moment to moment whether to be active or not. 
 So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,,it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.,But the foragers somehow decide not to come out.,And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.,This process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.,When I do these experiments with older colonies --,so ones that are five years or older --,they're much more consistent from one time to another,and much more homeostatic. The worse things get,,the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.,Whereas the young, small colonies --,the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable.,And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.,It could be this year, or this year.,So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable,are not any older than the ants in the younger colony.,It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.,Instead, something about the organization,must be changing as the colony gets older.,And the obvious thing that's changing is its size. 
 So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out,what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical,rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation --,that would have the outcome that I see,,these predictable dynamics, in who does what task.,And it would change as the colony gets larger.,And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.,So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.,They smell with their antennae.,When one ant touches another, it's smelling it,,and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate,because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,,with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.,And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,,the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.,And so what the message is, is not any message,that they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.,The pattern itself is the message.,And I'll tell you a little bit more about that. 
 But first you might be wondering:,how is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.,I expect to meet another forager every so often.,But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,,I'm less likely to forage.,So it has to know the difference between,a forager and a nest maintenance worker.,And we've learned that, in this species --,and I suspect in others as well --,these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,,is different as ants perform different tasks.,And we've done experiments that show that,that's because the longer an ant stays outside,,the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,,and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.,And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons --,they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow,keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.,And we've just recently demonstrated this,by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,,and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.,And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact,with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,,as they would to contact with real ants. 
 So I want now to show you a bit of film --,and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.,So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.,They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet,as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,,each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.,This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.,In the beginning you see the ants,just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.,But the idea is that the ants are in there,,and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it --,a stream of contacts with other ants.,And the pattern of these interactions determines,whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.,You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.,Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.,And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance,to decide whether to go out on their next trip,,are contacting the ants coming in. 
 So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.,It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.,The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable.,Because the rate at which ants come back depends on,all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.,And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern,must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.,So, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,,to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,,in the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies. 
 Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions,produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.,In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them,because they never seem to be doing anything,exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.,So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.,But it works pretty well.,Ants have been around for several hundred million years.,They cover the earth, except for Antarctica.,Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough,that this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,,produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.,And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection,might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns --,this network of interaction patterns --,to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies. 
 So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this,is that these patterns of interactions,are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.,The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony --,and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,,like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds.",But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,,just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.,So this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,,will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The new me is beauty. 
 (Laughter),Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,,but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable,but it would be ugly.",Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ... 
 This is neat.,Thank you for setting up my display.,I mean, it's just wonderful.,And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,,but I want it.,And that's my new life.,My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,,and "pretty," and "emotions.",The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun. 
 And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.,It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house --,but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice. 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition,and it comes with a little slip of paper,that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice.",The acid will ruin the gold plating. 
 (Laughter) 
 So actually, I took a carton of orange juice,and I poured it in the glass to take this picture. 
 (Laughter) 
 Beneath it is a wonderful knife.,It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.,First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.,Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced:,it holds well, it feels well.,And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.,It's a delight to use.,And so it's got everything, right?,It's beautiful and it's functional.,And I can tell you stories about it,,which makes it reflective,,and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.,And those are the three components. 
 Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab,took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,,and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water,with fish swimming in it.,And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,,the ripples spread out and the fish run away.,But of course, then the ball hits the other side,,the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Is that a good way to play ping-pong?,No. But is it fun?,Yeah! Yeah. 
 Or look at Google.,If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,",you get 10 pages of results.,So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.,Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.,This is one through 20. Next,",they just give you as many o's as there are pages.,It's really simple and subtle.,I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.,That's the subconscious mind,that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant,and you didn't know why.,And it's just clever.,And of course, what's especially good is,,if you type "design and emotion,",the first response out of those 10 pages is my website. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the weird thing is Google lies,,because if I type "design and emotion,",it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway.",So, OK.,So I type "design emotion",and my website wasn't first again.,It was third.,Oh well, different story. 
 There was this wonderful review in The New York Times,about the MINI Cooper automobile.,It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.,Buy it anyway.,It's so much fun to drive.",And if you look at the inside of the car --,I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,,this is me taking a picture while my son is driving --,and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.,It's round, it's neat.,The controls work wonderfully.,So that's my new life; it's all about fun. 
 I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,,and that never made any sense to me,until I finally figured out -- look ...,I'm going to put a plank on the ground.,So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long,and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,,I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.,No problem.,Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --,and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.,Intense fear paralyzes you.,It actually affects the way the brain works. 
 So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down,until just a few days or hours before the talk,,and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.,That's what fear and anxiety does;,it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing --,to focus, not be distracted.,And I couldn't force myself across that.,Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.,But it really changes the way you think. 
 And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,,did this wonderful experiment.,She brought students in to solve problems.,So, she'd bring people into the room,,and there'd be a string hanging down here,and a string hanging down here.,It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it --,some papers and scissors and stuff.,And she'd bring them in,,and she'd say,,"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.,Would you tie those two strings together?",So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here,and they couldn't reach the other string.,Still can't reach it.,And, basically, none of them could solve it.,You bring in a second group of people,,and you say, "Oh, before we start,,I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.,Would you like the box of candy?" 
 And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --,not very happy, but a little bit of happy.,And guess what -- they solved the problem.,And it turns out that when you're anxious,you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you,makes you depth-first.,And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence --,you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,,which makes you a breadth-first problem solver:,you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.,That's what brainstorming is about, right?,With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,,and we say, "No criticism,",and you get all these weird, neat ideas.,But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done,because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it.",So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?,You've got be anxious.,The brain works differently,if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.,You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out.",No big deal. 
 There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.,Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology tonlike bright colors.,That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits,and bright plants, because you eat the fruit,and you thereby spread the seed.,There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.,We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,,we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.,We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;,we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.,So that's the visceral level.,In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,,like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.,Or the 1963 Jaguar:,It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,,but the owners love it.,And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.,A water bottle:,You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.,And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.,They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration,or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.,It's all about the visceral experience. 
 The middle level of processing is the behavioral level,and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.,Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.,Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.,Almost everything we do is subconscious.,I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.,I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;,it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.,Most of what we do is subconscious.,Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious,,controlled by the behavioral side.,And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,,which includes usability, understanding --,but also the feel and heft. 
 That's why the Global knives are so neat.,They're so nicely balanced, so sharp,,that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.,Or, just driving a high-performance sports car,over a demanding curb --,again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.,Or the sensual feeling.,This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,,and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.,It will squirt you all around,and you can stay in that shower for hours --,and not waste water, by the way,,because it recirculates the same dirty water. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found,at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.,It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.,That's kind of what the teapot looks like,but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,,and you put tea in,,and then you fill it with water.,The water then seeps over the tea.,And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right --,the tea is to the right of this line.,There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there,and the water is filling it up like that.,And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.,And that means the tea is partially covered,while it completes the brewing.,And when it's finished, you put it vertically,,and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line,and the water only comes to here --,and so it keeps the tea out.,On top of that, it communicates,,which is what emotion does. 
 Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.,It's being safe in the world.,Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it --,saying good, bad, safe, dangerous,,and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.,And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else --,because their muscles are acting, subconsciously,,except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.,Well, this has emotions if you like,,because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright.",And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?",It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design. 
 And the third level is reflective,,which is, if you like the superego,,it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,,no control over the -- doesn't see the senses,,doesn't control the muscles.,It looks over what's going on.,It's that little voice in your head,that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad.",Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand.",It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness. 
 Here's a great reflective product.,Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life --,all sorts of exotic cars,,but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention.",It's about attention. It's about their image,,not about the car.,If you want a more positive model --,this is the GM car.,And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.,And you'll buy it to protect the environment,,even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive,and not perfected.,But that's reflective design as well.,Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people --,"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch.",As opposed to this one,,which is a pure behavioral watch,,which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.,But it's ugly.,This is a clear Don Norman watch. 
 And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,,the visceral fear of falling,against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe.",If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.,So, it's pitting one against the other.,The other neat thing ... 
 (Laughter) 
 So Jake Cress is this furniture maker,,and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.,And this is his chair with claw,,and the poor little chair has lost its ball,and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.,And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.,And that's what's nice about emotion. 
 So that's the new me.,I'm only saying positive things from now on. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)This song is one of Thomas' favorites,,called "What You Do with What You've Got."

 (Applause) Thank you very much.This is about a place in London,called Kiteflyer's Hill,where I used to go and spend hours,going "When is he coming back?

 (Applause) 
 Gracias. Thank you very much.I'm not quite sure whethernI really want to see a snare drum,at nine o'clock or so in the morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 But anyway, it's just greatnto see such a full theater,,and really, I must thanknHerbie Hancock and his colleagues,for such a great presentation. 
 (Applause) 
 One of the interesting things, of course,,is the combination of that raw handnon the instrument and technology,,and what he said about listeningnto our young people. 
 Of course, my job is all about listening.,And my aim, really,nis to teach the world to listen.,That's my only real aim in life.,And it sounds quite simple,nbut actually, it's quite a big, big job.,Because you know, when you looknat a piece of music, for example,,if I just open my little motorbike bag --,we have here, hopefully,,a piece of music that is fullnof little black dots on the page.,And, you know, we open it up ...,And I read the music.,So technically, I can actually read this.,I will follow the instructions,nthe tempo markings, the dynamics.,I will do exactly as I'm told.,And so therefore, because time is short,,if I just played you, literally,nthe first, maybe, two lines or so --,It's very straightforward; there's nothingntoo difficult about the piece.,But here, I'm being toldnthat the piece of music is very quick.,I'm being told where to play on the drum.,I'm being told which partnof the stick to use.,And I'm being told the dynamic.,And I'm also being toldnthat the drum is without snares.,Snares on, snares off.,So therefore, if I translatenthis piece of music,,we have this idea. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 (Drum sounds end) 
 And so on.,My career would probably lastnabout five years. 
 (Laughter) 
 However, what I have to do as a musician,is do everything that is not on the music;,everything that there isn't timento learn from a teacher,,or to talk about, even, from a teacher.,But it's the things you notice whennyou're not actually with your instrument,that, in fact, become so interesting,nand that you want to explore,through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.,So there, we experience the translation.,Now we'll experience the interpretation. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 (Drum sounds end) 
 (Applause) 
 Now my career may last a little longer. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in a way, you know,nit's the same if I look at you,and I see a nice, bright young ladynwith a pink top on.,I see that you're clutchingna teddy bear, etc., etc.,So I get a basic ideanas to what you might be about,,what you might like, what you might donas a profession, etc., etc.,However, that's just the initial ideanI may have that we all get,when we actually looknand we try to interpret.,But actually it's so unbelievably shallow.,In the same way, I looknat the music; I get a basic idea;,I wonder what technically might be hard,nor, you know, what I want to do.,Just the basic feeling. 
 However, that is simply not enough.,And I think what Herbie said:nplease listen, listen.,We have to listennto ourselves, first of all.,If I play, for example,nholding the stick --,where literally I do not let gonof the stick -- 
 (Drum sound) 
 you'll experience quite a lotnof shock coming up through the arm.,And you feel really quite --nbelieve it or not --,detached from the instrumentnand from the stick,,even though I'm actually holdingnthe stick quite tightly. 
 (Drum sound) 
 By holding it tightly,nI feel strangely more detached.,If I just simply let go,and allow my hand, my arm,nto be more of a support system,,suddenly -- 
 (Drum sound) 
 I have more dynamic with less effort.,Much more -- 
 (Drum sound) 
 and I just feel, at last,none with the stick,and one with the drum.,And I'm doing far, far less. 
 So in the same way that I needntime with this instrument,,I need time with peoplenin order to interpret them.,Not just translate them,nbut interpret them.,If, for example, I play justna few bars of a piece of music,for which I think of myselfnas a technician --,that is, someone who is basicallyna percussion player -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 (Marimba sounds end) 
 And so on, if I think of myselfnas a musician -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 (Marimba sounds end) 
 And so on.,There is a little bit of a differencenthere that is worth just -- 
 (Applause) 
 thinking about. 
 And I remember when I was 12 years old,,and I started playing timpaninand percussion,,and my teacher said,,"Well, how are we going to do this?nYou know, music is about listening.",And I said, "Yes, I agree with that,nso what's the problem?",And he said, "Well,nhow are you going to hear this?,How are you going to hear that?",And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?",He said, "Well, I thinknI hear it through here.",And I said, "Well, I think I do too,nbut I also hear it through my hands,,through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,,my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on." 
 And so we began our lessonsnevery single time,tuning drums, in particular,nthe kettle drums, or timpani,to such a narrow pitch interval,nso something like -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 that of a difference.,Then gradually: 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 And gradually: 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 And it's amazing that when you donopen your body up,,and open your hand up to allownthe vibration to come through,,that in fact the tiny, tiny difference -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 can be felt with just the tiniestnpart of your finger, there. 
 And so what we would donis that I would put my hands,on the wall of the music room,,and together, we would "listen"nto the sounds of the instruments,,and really try to connectnwith those sounds,far, far more broadlynthan simply depending on the ear.,Because of course, the earnis subject to all sorts of things.,The room we happen to be in,nthe amplification,,the quality of the instrument,nthe type of sticks -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 (Marimba sounds end) 
 Etc., etc., they're all different. 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 (Marimba sounds end) 
 Same amount of weight,nbut different sound colors.,And that's basically what we are;nwe're just human beings,,but we all have our ownnlittle sound colors, as it were,,that make up these extraordinarynpersonalities and characters,and interests and things. 
 And as I grew older, I then auditioned,for the Royal Academy of Music in London,,and they said, "Well, no, we won'tnaccept you, because we haven't a clue,,you know, of the futurenof a so-called 'deaf musician.'",And I just couldn't quite accept that.,And so therefore, I said to them,n"Well, look, if you refuse --,if you refuse me through those reasons,,as opposed to the ability to perform,and to understand and loventhe art of creating sound --,then we have to think very, very hardnabout the people you do actually accept.",And as a result,nonce we got over a little hurdle,,and having to audition twice,,they accepted me.,And not only that,,what had happened was that it changednthe whole role of the music institutions,throughout the United Kingdom. 
 Under no circumstances were they to refuse,any application whatsoever,on the basis of whether someonenhad no arms, no legs --,they could still perhaps play a windninstrument if it was supported on a stand.,No circumstances at allnwere used to refuse any entry.,And every single entrynhad to be listened to, experienced,,and then, based on the musical ability,,then that personncould either enter or not.,And so therefore, this in turn meant,that there was an extremelyninteresting bunch of students,who arrived in these variousnmusic institutions,,and I have to say, many of them nownin the professional orchestras,throughout the world.,The interesting thingnabout this as well, though -- 
 (Applause) 
 is quite simply that not only were peoplenconnected with sound --,which is basically all of us --,we well know that musicnreally is our daily medicine. 
 I say "music," but actuallynI mean "sound.",Because some of the extraordinarynthings I've experienced as a musician --,when you may have a 15-year-old lad,who has got the mostnincredible challenges,,who may not be ablento control his movements,,who may be deaf,nwho may be blind, etc., etc. --,suddenly, if that young ladnsits close to this instrument,,and perhaps even liesnunderneath the marimba,,and you play somethingnthat's so incredibly organ-like, almost --,I don't really haventhe right sticks, perhaps --,but something like this --nlet me change -- 
 (Soft marimba sounds) 
 (Soft marimba sounds end) 
 Something that's so unbelievably simple --,but he would be experiencingnsomething that I wouldn't be,,because I'm on top of the sound.,I have the sound coming this way.,He would have the soundncoming through the resonators.,If there were no resonatorsnon here, we would have: 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 So he would have a fullness of sound,that those of you in the front few rowsnwouldn't experience,,those of you in the back few rowsnwouldn't experience, either.,Every single one of us,ndepending on where we're sitting,,will experience this soundnquite, quite differently.,And of course, beingnthe participator of the sound,,and that is, starting from the ideanof what type of sound,I want to produce,nfor example, this sound: 
 (No sound) 
 Can you hear anything?,Exactly -- becausenI'm not even touching it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But yet, we get the sensationnof something happening.,In the same waynthat when I see a tree moves,,then I imagine that treenmaking a rustling sound.,Do you see what I mean?,Whatever the eye sees,nthen there's always sound happening.,So there's always, always that huge --,I mean, just this kaleidoscopenof things to draw from. 
 So all of my performancesnare based on entirely what I experience,,and not by learning a piece of music,,putting on someone else'sninterpretation of it,,buying all the CDs possiblenof that particular piece of music,,and so on and so forth,,because that isn't giving me enoughnof something that is so raw and so basic,,and something that I can fullynexperience the journey of.,So it may be that, in certain halls,,this dynamic may well work. 
 (Soft marimba sounds) 
 (Soft marimba sounds end) 
 It may be that in other halls,,they're simply not goingnto experience that at all,,and so therefore, my level of soft,ngentle playing may have to be -- 
 (Marimba sounds) 
 (Marimba sounds end) 
 Do you see what I mean?,So, because of this explosionnin access to sound,,especially through the Deaf community,,this has not only affectednhow music institutions,,how schools for the deaf treat sound,nand not just as a means of therapy --,although, of course,nbeing a participator of music,,that definitely is the case as well --,but it's meant that acousticiansnhave had to really think,about the types of hallsnthey put together.,There are so few halls in this world,that actually havenvery good acoustics, dare I say.,But by that I mean, where you cannabsolutely do anything you imagine.,The tiniest, softest, softest soundnto something that is so broad,,so huge, so incredible.,There's always something:,it may sound good up there,nmay not be so good there;,it may be great there,nbut terrible up there;,maybe terrible over there,nbut not too bad there, etc., etc. 
 So to find an actual hall is incredible --,for which you can playnexactly what you imagine,,without it being cosmetically enhanced.,So therefore, acousticiansnare actually in conversation,with people who are hearing impaired,,and who are participators of sound.,And this is quite interesting.,I cannot give you any detail,as far as what is actually happeningnwith those halls,,but it's just the factnthat they are going to a group of people,for whom so many years, we've been saying,,"Well, how on earth can they experiencenmusic? They're deaf.",We go like that, and we imaginenthat's what deafness is about.,Or we go like that, and we imaginenthat's what blindness is about.,If we see someone in a wheelchair,nwe assume they cannot walk.,It may be that they can walknthree, four, five steps.,That, to them, means they can walk.,In a year's time,nit could be two extra steps.,In another year's time, three extra steps. 
 Those are hugely importantnaspects to think about.,So when we do listen to each other,,it's unbelievably important for us,to really test our listening skills,,to really use our bodiesnas a resonating chamber,,to stop the judgment.,For me, as a musician who dealsnwith 99 percent of new music,,it's very easy for me to say,,"Oh yes, I like that piece.nNo, I don't like that piece," and so on.,And I just find that I have to giventhose pieces of music real time.,It may be that the chemistrynisn't quite right between myself,and that particular piece of music,,but that doesn't mean I have the rightnto say it's a bad piece of music.,And you know, one of the great thingsnabout being a musician,is that it is so unbelievably fluid.,So there are no rules, no right,nno wrong, this way, that way. 
 If I asked you to clap --nmaybe I can do this.,If I can just say, "Please clapnand create the sound of thunder.",I'm assuming we've allnexperienced thunder.,Now, I don't mean just the sound;,I mean really listennto that thunder within yourselves.,And please try to create thatnthrough your clapping.,Try, just -- please try. 
 (Loud clapping sounds) 
 (Clapping ends) 
 Snow. 
 (Laughter) 
 Snow. 
 (Soft clapping sounds) 
 Have you ever heard snow? 
 Audience: No. 
 Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping. 
 (Laughter) 
 Try again. Try again: snow. 
 (No sound) 
 See, you're awake. 
 Rain. 
 (Light clapping sounds) 
 EG: (Laughs) 
 Not bad. Not bad.,The interesting thing here, though,nis that I asked a group of kids,not so long ago,exactly the same question.,Now -- great imagination,nthank you very much.,However, not one of you got outnof your seats to think,,"Right! How can I clap?,OK, maybe: 
 (Clapping sounds) 
 Maybe I can use my jewelrynto create extra sounds.,Maybe I can use the other partsnof my body to create extra sounds.",Not a single one of you thoughtnabout clapping in a slightly different way,other than sitting in your seatsnthere and using two hands.,In the same way, when we listen to music,,we assume that it's all beingnfed through here.,This is how we experience music.,Of course, it's not. 
 We experience thunder, thunder, thunder.,Think, think, think.,Listen, listen, listen.,Now, what can we do with thunder?,I remember my teacher, when I firstnstarted, my very first lesson,,I was all preparednwith sticks, ready to go.,And instead of him saying,n"OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,,arms at a more or less 90-degree angle,nsticks in a more or less V shape,,keep this amount of space here, etc.,Please keep your back straight,netc., etc., etc." --,where I was just probably going to end upnabsolutely rigid, frozen,,and I would not be able to strike the drum,because I was thinkingnof so many other things,,he said, "Evelyn, take this drumnaway for seven days,,and I'll see you next week." 
 So -- heavens! What was I to do?,I no longer required the sticks.,I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.,I had to basically looknat this particular drum,,see how it was made,,what these little lugs did,nwhat the snares did.,Turned it upside down,nexperimented with the shell. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 Experimented with the head. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 Experimented with my body. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 Experimented with jewelry.,Experimented with all sorts of things. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 (Drum sounds end) 
 And of course, I returnednwith all sorts of bruises. 
 (Laughter) 
 But nevertheless, it was suchnan unbelievable experience,,because where on earth are you goingnto experience that in a piece of music?,Where on earth are you goingnto experience that in a study book?,So we never, ever dealtnwith actual study books.,So for example,none of the things that we learn,when we are dealingnwith being a percussion player,as opposed to a musician,,is basically, straightforwardnsingle-stroke rolls. 
 (Drum sounds) 
 Like that, and thennwe get a little faster -- 
 (Drum sounds) 
 and a little faster -- 
 (Drum sounds) 
 and a little faster,nand so on and so forth.,What does this piece require?,Single-stroke rolls. 
 (Drum sound) 
 So why can't I then do thatnwhilst learning a piece of music?,And that's exactly what he did.,And interestingly, the older I became,nand when I became a full-time student,at a so-called "music institution,"nall of that went out of the window.,We had to study from study books.,And constantly, the question, "Well, why?nWhy? What is this relating to?,I need to play a piece of music.","Well, this will help your control.","Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?,I need to relate it to a piece of music.,You know, I need to say something. 
 Why am I practicing paradiddles? 
 (Drum sounds) 
 Is it just literally for control,nfor hand-stick control?,Why am I doing that?,I need to have the reason,,and the reason has to be by sayingnsomething through the music.",And by saying something through music,nwhich basically is sound,,we then can reach all sortsnof things to all sorts of people.,But I don't want to take responsibilitynof your emotional baggage.,That's up to you,nwhen you walk through a hall,,because that then determinesnwhat and how we listen to certain things.,I may feel sorrowful, or happy,nor exhilarated, or angry,when I play certain pieces of music,,but I'm not necessarily wanting younto feel exactly the same thing.,So please, the next timenyou go to a concert,,just allow your body to open up,,allow your body to benthis resonating chamber.,Be aware that you're not goingnto experience the same thing,as the performer is. 
 The performer is in the worst possiblenposition for the actual sound,,because they're hearingnthe contact of the stick -- 
 (Drum sound) 
 on the drum, or the malletnon the bit of wood,,or the bow on the string, etc.,,or the breath that's creatingnthe sound from wind and brass.,They're experiencing that rawness there.,But yet they're experiencingnsomething so unbelievably pure,,which is before the soundnis actually happening.,Please take note of the life of the soundnafter the actual initial strike,,or breath, is being pulled.,Just experience the wholenjourney of that sound,in the same way that I wishednI'd experienced the whole journey,of this particular conference,nrather than just arriving last night.,But I hope maybe we can sharenone or two things as the day progresses.,But thank you very much for having me!

 (Applause)How will we be remembered in 200 years?,I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,,which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:,the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.,It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,,and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.,It happened 225 years ago.,It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.,The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,,and it was a very, very severe winter.,And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter,from hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.,What they remember is, of course, the great triumph,,that the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.,And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.,It's the child that's remembered.,And that's what we're going through at this time. 
 I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,,because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist --,so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.,(Laughter),What I'm saying is that we should follow the model,that has been so successful with the electronic industry,,that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world,as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,,when kids could come home and play with them,,then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. 
 There's a huge --,(Laughter),(Applause),-- there's a huge community of people in the world,who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,,pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,,people who handle biology with their hands,,and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,,plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,,and that will be an enormous positive step,to acceptance of biotechnology.,That will blow away a lot of the opposition.,When people have this technology in their hands,,you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own --,grow your dog, grow your own cat.,(Laughter),(Applause),Just buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,,you can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and,I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,,becomes part of the human condition,,something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts. 
 So, let's leave that aside.,I want to talk about something quite different,,which is what I know about, and that is astronomy.,And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.,And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,,and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,,or whatever the time remains.,The important fact is, that most of the real estate,that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars,,I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach,for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --,most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun. 
 If you look at the solar system, as we know it today,,it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.,It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between,the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.,The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,,but not very large. And it's not very promising for life,,since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.,It's not only cold, but very dry.,So the asteroids we don't have much hope for. 
 There stand some interesting places a little further out:,the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.,Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is --,Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter,,where we see a very level ice surface,,which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.,So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.,And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.,Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate,,just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,,to go down through the ice,,find out who is swimming around in the ocean,,whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters --,whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.,But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.,We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,,so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there --,send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.,That's something we don't yet know how to do.,There are plans to do it, but it's hard. 
 Go out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,,way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.,You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,,in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud --,these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets,when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there,in the cold of the outer solar system,,but they are biologically very interesting indeed,,because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,,which are just the right ones for developing life.,So if life could be established out there,,it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight --,everything that's needed. 
 So, what I'm proposing,is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,,although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.,But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.,And that's what I'm going to talk about.,There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa,,and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.,It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,,just as it did on the Earth.,Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,,finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great --,much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures,developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.,And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened. 
 Now, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,,it could also have moved out onto the surface.,There wouldn't have been any air there -- it's a vacuum.,It is out in the cold, but it still could have come.,You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp,through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.,What would they need in order to grow on the surface?,They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves,from losing water through the skin.,So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.,But better -- what is more important,is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.,The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,,is 25 times fainter than it is here,,since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.,So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers,,which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have,either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,,so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.,Otherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,,which is certainly not favorable for developing life,,at least of the kind we know.,But if they just simply could grow, like leaves,,little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,,then they could keep warm on the surface.,They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight,and have roots going down into the ocean;,life then could flourish much more.,So, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely,that there's life on the surface of Europa.,None of these things is likely, but my,,my philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable. 
 There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things,turning out to be there. And I mean,,the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.,This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began,,Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.,And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.,They said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,,but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough,and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate,that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,,and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,,so it certainly will not be detectable.,So there's no point in looking.",And that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy,by about 20 years.,Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look.,Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look,,which was after about 20 years,,when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out,the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things,radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.,So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,,which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact,be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected,just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. 
 So, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.,There is something called pit lamping.,That's the phrase which I learned from my son George,,who is there in the audience.,You take -- that's a Canadian expression.,If you happen to want to hunt animals at night,,you take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.,You strap it onto your forehead, so you can see,the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,,you shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.,You see the red glow in their eyes,,which is the reflection of the flashlight.,And then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,,you shoot the animals and take them home.,And of course, that spoils the game,for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,,so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,,because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,,because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.,So, the farmers go out at night,with heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,,and anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.,(Laughter) 
 So I have proposed to apply the same trick,to looking for life in the universe.,That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces --,either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live,on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.,In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors --,in order to keep themselves warm.,And then, when you shine sunlight at them,,the sunlight will be reflected back,,just as it is in the eyes of an animal.,So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.,And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,,the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,,this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger,as you go further away,,because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light,shines out even more in contrast against the dark background.,So as you go further away from the Sun,,this becomes more and more powerful.,So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.,Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet. 
 But I hope that we shall look, and with any --,we probably won't find anything,,none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.,But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,,it will transform our view of life altogether.,Because it means that -- the way life can live out there,,it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.,It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.,We're having great difficulties at the moment,and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.,Especially if you breathe air,,it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,,because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --,(Laughter),-- you're dead --,(Laughter),-- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship. 
 But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface,of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,,this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the,smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,,and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there,,and you get knocked off the surface by a collision,,then it doesn't change anything all that much.,You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight,and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.,And then if you run into another object, you can stay there,and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,,from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,,it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then,a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution --,so there'll be a huge advantage to the species,which is able to jump from one place to another,without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages,for spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.,I call these creatures sunflowers.,They look like, maybe like sunflowers.,They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,,and they will be able to spread out in space,,because gravity on these objects is weak.,So they can collect sunlight from a big area.,So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect. 
 So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,,and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.,If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.,(Laughter),That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.,We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding,of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your,take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit --,(Laughter) --,is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,,a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.,That would be a fun thing to do.,(Laughter),In the long run, of course,,it would also make it possible for us to move out there.,What's going to happen in the end,,it's not going to be just humans colonizing space,,it's going to be life moving out from the Earth,,moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,,of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,,it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.,But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.,We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful,than it is today.,So again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.,Thank you.,(Applause)The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --,and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.,I'm just going to talk --,about where that's likely to carry us. 
 And you know, I saw all the visions,of the first couple of sessions.,It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk,about the future.,It felt wrong to do that in some way.,And yet, I don't really think it is,because when it comes down to it,,it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --,what people in the future are going to remember about this period. 
 I want to talk to you a little bit about,why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,,who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,,or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,,are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.,I'm focusing on biology,,the biological sciences.,The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be,the areas that are the most significant to us.,The reason for that is really very simple.,It's because we're flesh and blood.,We're biological creatures.,And what we can do with our biology,is going to shape our future,and that of our children and that of their children --,whether we gain control over aging,,whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,,and heart disease, and cancer. 
 I think that Shakespeare really put it very nicely.,And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.,(Laughter),He said, "And so from hour to hour,we ripe and ripe.,And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.,And thereby hangs a tale.",Life is short, you know.,And we need to think about planning a little bit.,We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,,going to have to lose everything that we love.,When you're beginning to rot a little bit,,all of the videos crammed into your head,,all of the extensions that extend your various powers,,are going to being to seem a little secondary.,And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil,,so is Eric Drexler. 
 This is where it's really central to our lives.,Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype,about our power to control biology.,You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.,It wasn't two years ago,that everybody was talking about --,we've found the Holy Grail of biology.,We're deciphering the code of codes.,We're reading the book of life.,It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,,and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.,And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey.",You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.,And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.,And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.,So it's not surprising that some people would wonder,whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,,we'll look back at this instant in time,,and all of the sort of talk about,the Human Genome Project,,and what all this is going to mean to us --,well, it will really mean precious little.,And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.,Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,,and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,,we're talking about changing ourselves.,And this is very critical stuff. 
 If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,,you just have to go to any major city.,This is not the stomping ground,of our Pleistocene ancestors.,What's happening is we're taking this technology --,it's becoming more precise, more potent --,and we're turning it back upon ourselves.,Before it's all done,we are going to alter ourselves,every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.,It's going to happen a lot sooner,than people imagine.,On the way there it's going to,completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.,It's going to change the way we have children.,It's going to change the way we manage,and alter our emotions.,It's going to probably change the human lifespan.,It will really make us question,what it is to be a human being. 
 The larger context of this is that are,two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.,The first of them is the obvious one,,the silicon revolution,,which you all are very, very familiar with.,It's changing our lives in so many ways,,and it will continue to do that.,What the essence of that is, is that we're taking,the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,,and we're breathing a level of complexity into it,that rivals that of life itself,,and may even surpass it.,As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,,is the revolution in biology. 
 The genomics revolution,,proteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics",that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.,What we're doing is we are,seizing control of our evolutionary future.,I mean we're essentially using technology,to just jam evolution into fast-forward.,It's not at all clear where it's going to take us.,But in five to ten years we're going to start see,some very profound changes.,The most immediate changes that we'll see,are things like in medicine.,There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine,as we start to be able to identify,all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.,But who is going to pay for all this?,And how are we going to understand all this complex information?,That is going to be the IT challenge,of the next generation, is communicating all this information. 
 There's pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology,and genetics:,tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions,that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.,That's going to have amazing impacts.,And it's going to be used for diet as well,,and nutritional supplements and such.,But it's going to have a big impact because,we're going to have niche drugs.,And we aren't going to be able to support,the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.,The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.,It's too slow.,It's too risk-averse.,And it is really not suited for the future,that we're moving into. 
 Another thing is that we're just going to have to deal with this knowledge.,It's really wonderful when we hear,,"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.,We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?",And look around you and know,that what we really care about is,that little bit of difference.,We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,,but not to each other,because we compete with each other all time.,And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact,that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,,and between subpopulations of humans as well.,To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that. 
 A generation or so away,there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.,That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.,Now I don't mean extra gills or something --,something we care about, like aging.,What if we could unravel aging and understand it --,begin to retard the process or even reverse it?,It would change absolutely everything.,And it's obvious to anyone,,that if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,,whatever the consequences are. 
 The second is modifying our emotions.,I mean Ritalin, Viagra,,things of that sort, Prozac.,You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.,What if you could take a little,concoction of pharmaceuticals,that would make you feel really contented,,just happy to be you.,Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?,Probably not.,And if you don't, who are you going to be?,Why do you do what you do?,We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.,It's going to be very challenging to deal with. 
 The third area is reproduction.,The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,,as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.,That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,",where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,,and the challenges it's going to present to society.,There are three obvious ways of doing this.,The first is cloning.,It didn't happen.,It's a total media circus.,It will happen in five to 10 years.,And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.,The birth of a delayed identical twin,is not going to shake western civilization. 
 But there are more important things that are already occurring:,embryo screening.,You take a six to eight cell embryo,,you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,,and depending on the results of that test,you either implant that embryo or you discard it.,It's already done to avoid rare diseases today.,And pretty soon it's going to be possible,to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.,As that becomes possible,this is going to move from something that is used by those who,have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,,to the wealthy who want to protect their children,,to just about everybody else.,And in that process that's going to morph,from being just for diseases,,to being for lesser vulnerabilities,,like risk of manic depression or something,,to picking personalities,,temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.,Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.,Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away --,going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.,The way I suspect it will happen,is using artificial chromosomes,and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46,to 47 or 48.,And one that is not heritable,because who would want to pass on to their children,the archaic enhancement modules,that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?,It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.,They'll want the new release. 
 Those kinds of loose analogies with,(Laughter),computers, and with programming,,are actually much deeper than that.,They are really going to come to operate in this realm.,Now not everything that can be done should be done.,And it won't be done.,But when something is feasible in thousands of,laboratories all over the world,,which is going to be the case with these technologies,,when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,,which is already the case,,and when they're almost impossible to police,,it's not a question of if this is going to happen,,it's when and where and how it's going to happen. 
 Humanity is going to go down this path.,And it's going to do so for two reasons.,The first is that all these technologies,are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research,that everybody wants to see happen.,It is being funded very very --,in a big way.,The second is, we're human.,That's what we do.,We try and use our technology to,improve our lives in one way or another.,To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies,when they become available,,is as much a denial of who we are,as to imagine,that we'll use these technologies and not fret,and worry about it a great deal.,The lines are going to blur. And they already are,between therapy and enhancement,,between treatment and prevention,,between need and desire.,That's really the central one, I believe. 
 People can try and ban these things.,They undoubtedly will. They have.,But ultimately all this is going to do,is just shift development elsewhere.,It's going to drive these things from view.,It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy,because they are in the best position,to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.,And it's going to deny us,the information that we need to make wise decisions,about how to use these technologies.,So, sure, we need to debate these things.,And I think it's wonderful that we do.,But we shouldn't kid ourselves,and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.,That is simply not going to happen.,They touch us too deeply.,And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,,upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.,Some people are going to see this,as an abomination,,as the worst thing, as just awful.,Other people are going to say, "This is great.,This is the flowering of human endeavor." 
 The one thing though that is really dangerous,about these sorts of technologies,,is that it's easy to become seduced by them.,And to focus too much on all,the high-technology possibilities that exist.,And to lose touch,with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.,There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine,is going to keep them, save them,,from overeating,,from eating a lot of fast foods,,from not getting any exercise.,It's not going to happen. 
 In the midst of all this amazing technology,,and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting,because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:,a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,,in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things,that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,,like to brand as non-science.,But this whole effort is generated,,is driven, by IT as well,because that is how we're gathering all this information,,and linking it, and integrating it together.,There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.,And that's where about half of our drugs come.,So we shouldn't dismiss this,because it's an enormous opportunity to use,these sorts of results,,or these random loose trials from the last thousand years,about what has impacts on our health.,And to use our advanced technologies,to pull out what is beneficial from this,sea of noise, basically. 
 In fact this isn't just abstract.,I just formed a biotechnology company,that is using,this sort of an approach to develop,therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,,and we're making some real progress.,So here we are.,It's the beginning of a new millennium.,If you look forward,,I mean future humans,,far before the end of this millennium,,in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.,And from the beginning of today's sessions,you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible,difficult, painful period,that we struggled through.,And I don't think that's what's going to happen.,They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.,And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.,They are going to think about it,as this glorious instant,when we laid down,the very foundations of their lives,,of their society, of their future.,You know it's a little bit like a birth.,Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.,And then what comes out of it? New life.,Actually as was pointed out earlier,,we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there. 
 So to me,,it's clear that one of the foundations of that future,is going to be the reworking of our biology.,It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.,We're going to make lots of errors.,That's the way these things work.,To me it's an incredible privilege,to be alive now,and to be able to witness this thing.,It is something that is a unique instant,in the history of all of life.,It will always be remembered.,And what's extraordinary is that,we're not just observing this,,we are the architects of this.,I think that we should be proud of it.,What is so difficult and challenging,is that we are also the objects of these changes.,It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.,And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people,who would pull back in fear.,I think that our choice,in the choice of life,,is not whether we're going to go down this path.,We are, definitely.,It's how we hold it in our hearts.,It's how we look at it.,I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly,in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.,Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did.,"The bravest are surely those,who have the clearest vision of what is before them,,both glory and danger alike.,And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it." 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Let's just get started here. 
 Okay, just a moment. 
 (Whirring) 
 All right.,(Laughter),Oh, sorry. 
 (Music) (Beatboxing) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.,You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,,who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,,and, of course, with technology it never is.,So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.,I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,,with such an incredible last half a dozen years,,that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.,A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things,and what we're supposed to expect about the future,depends on how we bucket things,and how we categorize them. 
 And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust,that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.,It's easy to think of this analogy as very different,from some of the other things you might pick.,For one thing, both were very real.,In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million,worth of gold out of California. It was very real.,The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to,communicate with each other. It's a big deal.,Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.,You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.,I don't have to remind you of all the hype,that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com. 
 But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold.",Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.,Some have 5,000. Many have more.,A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.,People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.,"The Eldorado of the United States of America:,the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.",And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.,So many people left what they were doing.,And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years. 
 People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,,they thought, "Ah, this isn't real.",But they keep hearing about people getting rich,,and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.,By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth,by not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.,These are community affairs, by the way.,Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams,of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,,and they would form companies.,These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,,if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,,no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold. 
 This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,,he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.,They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,,and then take another ship north.,This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.,This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.,These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,,a surgeon in the other.,Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com. 
 (Laughter) 
 In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.,The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak,because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon,to go search for gold.,So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.,They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.,You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.,And you saw some of the excesses,that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.,The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.,Half of them deserted to go look for gold.,And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half,because they were afraid they wouldn't come back. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:,"The struggle between right and six dollars a month,and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one.",They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.,This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.,They loaded up their mules and their horses.,And they didn't plan right.,And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,,and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.,In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died,before they could get where they were going.,It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail." 
 And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:,"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,,sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,,with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,,sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes,and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,,often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,,a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches,turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.,The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere,account for the myriads of ravens along the road.,The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,,the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,,cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described." 
 And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,,we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.,I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.,This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000. 
 (Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.,Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?,Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.,Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?,Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.,OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world. 
 Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they spent three and a half million dollars,in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,,even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.,Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,,and I think rather severely.,And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.,Here's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson,at the present time who feel keenly disappointed.,They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,,spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform,and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch,have reached the coveted goal only to discover,the fact that there is nothing here for them." 
 And that was, of course, the very common story.,Because when you take out that last piece of gold --,and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --,the entire American river region, within two years --,every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies,who used more sophisticated mining technologies,started to take gold out of there.,So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic,and that analogy is the electric industry.,And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.,With the electric industry you actually have to --,one of them is that they're both sort of thin,,horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.,It's not a specific thing. 
 But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.,You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.,It's an incredible means of coordinating,,in a very fine-grained way, information flows.,There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.,And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on,is sort of the golden age of appliances.,The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.,So the light bulb is what wired the world.,And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.,They were really thinking about --,they weren't putting electricity into the home;,they were putting lighting into the home.,And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time. 
 This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.,All the streets had to be torn up.,This is work going on down in lower Manhattan,where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.,And they're tearing up all the streets.,The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,,which became General Electric,,paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.,But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.,Because, remember, the Web got to stand,on top of all this heavy infrastructure,that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.,So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --,I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,,when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.,How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994,when people weren't really investing in the Web?,Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down. 
 So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,,and then home appliances started coming into being.,And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --,this was the 1890 electric fan.,And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --,it depends how you want to measure it --,but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.,It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.,The electric iron, also very big.,By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's asbestos under that handle there.,This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,,from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds,and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.,So it wasn't a big seller.,This was truly, truly an early-adopter product --,(Laughter),the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.,But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.,Now, not all these things were highly successful. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.,People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.,These never really caught on either:,the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.,This came in, like, six different colors. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know why. But I thought, you know,,sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;,maybe it's time to give this one another shot.,So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.,We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --,(Laughter),I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.,Now, the toaster was huge,because they used to make toast on open fires,,and it took a lot of time and attention.,I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.,They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.,So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.,They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.,They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.,And you'd plug it in there. 
 In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,,you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.,All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb,if you wanted to plug in an appliance.,The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.,Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.,Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.,On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.,And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.,And it would clean your clothes.,This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,,put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.,And this was a big deal.,You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.,And you'd run a long cord into the house,where you could screw it into your light socket. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,,because they hadn't invented the off switch.,That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --,because it didn't make any sense.,I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.,So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.,That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.,And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,,so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.,And there are --,when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions,of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.,And they couldn't yank the cord out,because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house. 
 (Laughter),And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.,And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors,to be plugging things into a light socket like this.,But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,,I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.,This is a total kludge, if you ask me.,First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --,(Laughter),and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.,This is what it looks like under my desk.,I took this picture just two days ago.,So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a total, total mess.,And, you know, we think it's getting better,,but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself? 
 (Laughter) 
 I challenge you to try. It's very hard.,I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --,this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter),And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.,Try to get DSL installed in your house.,The engineers who do it everyday can't do it.,They have to -- typically, they come three times.,And one friend of mine was telling me a story:,not only did they get there and have to wait,,but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,,for the third time, they had to call somebody.,And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone,because then they had to wait on hold for an hour,to talk to somebody to give them an access code,after they got there.,So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves. 
 By the way, DSL is a kludge.,I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed,for the purpose it's being put to --,you know it's the whole thing --,we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.,Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,,then you'd be pretty depressed right now,because the last nugget of gold would be gone.,But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.,Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities. 
 And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --,this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --,and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --,but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --,we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.,That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,,but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.,We're in 1908. 
 And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:,"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.",1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb.",My mom hates this picture. 
 (Laughter) 
 She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,,very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,,then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.,And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us,than there is behind us.,And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.,This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.,It says: "Use your electricity for more than light.",And I think that's where we are.,We're very, very early. Thank you very much.I do two things:,I design mobile computersnand I study brains.,Today's talk is about brainsnand -- (Audience member cheers),Yay! I have a brain fan out there. 
 (Laughter),If I could have my first slide,,you'll see the title of my talknand my two affiliations.,So what I'm going to talk about is whynwe don't have a good brain theory,,why it is importantnthat we should develop one,and what we can do about it.,I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes.,I have two affiliations.,Most of you know menfrom my Palm and Handspring days,,but I also run a nonprofitnscientific research institute,called the Redwood NeurosciencenInstitute in Menlo Park.,We study theoretical neurosciencenand how the neocortex works.,I'm going to talk all about that. 
 I have one slide on my other life,nthe computer life,,and that's this slide here.,These are some of the productsnI've worked on over the last 20 years,,starting from the very original laptop,to some of the first tablet computers,and so on, ending upnmost recently with the Treo,,and we're continuing to do this.,I've done this becausenI believe mobile computing,is the future of personal computing,,and I'm trying to makenthe world a little bit better,by working on these things.,But this was, I admit, all an accident.,I really didn't want to donany of these products.,Very early in my career,I decided I was not going to benin the computer industry. 
 Before that, I just have to tell you,about this picture of GraffitinI picked off the web the other day.,I was looking for a picture for Graffitinthat'll text input language.,I found a website dedicated to teachersnwho want to make script-writing things,across the top of their blackboard,,and they had added Graffiti to it,nand I'm sorry about that. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what happened was,,when I was young and got outnof engineering school at Cornell in '79,,I went to work for Intelnand was in the computer industry,,and three months into that,nI fell in love with something else.,I said, "I madenthe wrong career choice here,",and I fell in love with brains.,This is not a real brain.,This is a picture of one, a line drawing.,And I don't remembernexactly how it happened,,but I have one recollection,nwhich was pretty strong in my mind.,In September of 1979,,Scientific American came outnwith a single-topic issue about the brain.,It was one of their best issues ever.,They talked about the neuron,ndevelopment, disease, vision,and all the things you might wantnto know about brains.,It was really quite impressive. 
 One might've had the impressionnwe knew a lot about brains.,But the last article in that issuenwas written by Francis Crick of DNA fame.,Today is, I think, the 50th anniversarynof the discovery of DNA.,And he wrote a story basically saying,nthis is all well and good,,but you know, we don't knowndiddly squat about brains,,and no one has a clue how they work,,so don't believe what anyone tells you.,This is a quotenfrom that article, he says:,"What is conspicuously lacking" --nhe's a very proper British gentleman --,"What is conspicuously lackingnis a broad framework of ideas,in which to interpretnthese different approaches.",I thought the word "framework" was great.,He didn't say we didn't have a theory.,He says we don't even knownhow to begin to think about it.,We don't even have a framework.,We are in the pre-paradigm days,nif you want to use Thomas Kuhn.,So I fell in love with this.,I said, look: We have all this knowledgenabout brains -- how hard can it be?,It's something we can work onnin my lifetime; I could make a difference.,So I tried to get out of the computernbusiness, into the brain business. 
 First, I went to MIT,nthe AI lab was there.,I said, I want to buildnintelligent machines too,,but I want to study how brains work first.,And they said, "Oh, youndon't need to do that.,You're just going to programncomputers, that's all.,I said, you really ought to study brains.,They said, "No, you're wrong.",I said, "No, you're wrong,"nand I didn't get in. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was a little disappointed --npretty young --,but I went back again a few years later,,this time in California,nand I went to Berkeley.,And I said, I'll gonin from the biological side.,So I got in the PhD program in biophysics.,I was like, I'm studying brains now.nWell, I want to study theory.,They said, "You can'tnstudy theory about brains.,You can't get funded for that.,And as a graduate student,nyou can't do that.",So I said, oh my gosh.,I was depressed; I said, but I cannmake a difference in this field.,I went back in the computer industry,and said, I'll have to worknhere for a while.,That's when I designednall those computer products. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, I want to do thisnfor four years, make some money,,I was having a family,nand I would mature a bit,,and maybe the businessnof neuroscience would mature a bit.,Well, it took longer than four years.nIt's been about 16 years.,But I'm doing it now,nand I'm going to tell you about it.,So why should we have a good brain theory?,Well, there's lots of reasonsnpeople do science.,The most basic one is,npeople like to know things.,We're curious, and we go outnand get knowledge.,Why do we study ants? It's interesting.,Maybe we'll learn something useful,nbut it's interesting and fascinating.,But sometimes a sciencenhas other attributes,which makes it really interesting. 
 Sometimes a science will tellnsomething about ourselves;,it'll tell us who we are.,Evolution did thisnand Copernicus did this,,where we have a newnunderstanding of who we are.,And after all, we are our brains.nMy brain is talking to your brain.,Our bodies are hanging along for the ride,,but my brain is talking to your brain.,And if we want to understandnwho we are and how we feel and perceive,,we need to understand brains.,Another thing is sometimes science leadsnto big societal benefits, technologies,,or businesses or whatever.,This is one, too, becausenwhen we understand how brains work,,we'll be able to buildnintelligent machines.,That's a good thing on the whole,,with tremendous benefits to society,,just like a fundamental technology. 
 So why don't we havena good theory of brains?,People have been workingnon it for 100 years.,Let's first take a looknat what normal science looks like.,This is normal science.,Normal science is a nice balancenbetween theory and experimentalists.,The theorist guy says,n"I think this is what's going on,",the experimentalist says, "You're wrong.",It goes back and forth,nthis works in physics, this in geology.,But if this is normal science,nwhat does neuroscience look like?,This is what neuroscience looks like.,We have this mountain of data,,which is anatomy, physiology and behavior.,You can't imagine how much detailnwe know about brains.,There were 28,000 people who wentnto the neuroscience conference this year,,and every one of themnis doing research in brains.,A lot of data, but no theory.,There's a little wimpy box on top there. 
 And theory has not played a rolenin any sort of grand way,in the neurosciences.,And it's a real shame.,Now, why has this come about?,If you ask neuroscientistsnwhy is this the state of affairs,,first, they'll admit it.,But if you ask them, they say,,there's various reasonsnwe don't have a good brain theory.,Some say we still don't have enough data,,we need more information,nthere's all these things we don't know.,Well, I just told you there's datancoming out of your ears.,We have so much information,nwe don't even know how to organize it.,What good is more going to do?,Maybe we'll be lucky and discovernsome magic thing, but I don't think so.,This is a symptom of the factnthat we just don't have a theory.,We don't need more data,nwe need a good theory. 
 Another one is sometimes people say,,"Brains are so complex,nit'll take another 50 years.",I even think Chris said somethingnlike this yesterday, something like,,it's one of the most complicatednthings in the universe.,That's not true -- you're morencomplicated than your brain.,You've got a brain.,And although the brainnlooks very complicated,,things look complicatednuntil you understand them.,That's always been the case.,So we can say, my neocortex,nthe part of the brain I'm interested in,,has 30 billion cells.,But, you know what?nIt's very, very regular.,In fact, it looks like it's the same thingnrepeated over and over again.,It's not as complex as it looks.nThat's not the issue. 
 Some people say,nbrains can't understand brains.,Very Zen-like. Woo. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, it sounds good, but why?nI mean, what's the point?,It's just a bunch of cells.nYou understand your liver.,It's got a lot of cells in it too, right?,So, you know, I don't thinknthere's anything to that.,And finally, some people say,,"I don't feel like a bunchnof cells -- I'm conscious.,I've got this experience,nI'm in the world.,I can't be just a bunch of cells.",Well, people used to believenthere was a life force to be living,,and we now knownthat's really not true at all.,And there's really no evidence,,other than that people just disbelieventhat cells can do what they do.,So some people have fallenninto the pit of metaphysical dualism,,some really smart people, too,nbut we can reject all that. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, there's something else,,something really fundamental, and it is:,another reason why we don't havena good brain theory,is because we have an intuitive,nstrongly held but incorrect assumption,that has prevented usnfrom seeing the answer.,There's something we believe that just,nit's obvious, but it's wrong.,Now, there's a history of this in sciencenand before I tell you what it is,,I'll tell you about the historynof it in science.,Look at other scientific revolutions --,the solar system, that's Copernicus,,Darwin's evolution,nand tectonic plates, that's Wegener.,They all have a lot in commonnwith brain science. 
 First, they had a lotnof unexplained data. A lot of it.,But it got more manageablenonce they had a theory.,The best minds were stumped --nreally smart people.,We're not smarter now than they were then;,it just turns out it's reallynhard to think of things,,but once you've thought of them,nit's easy to understand.,My daughters understoodnthese three theories,,in their basic framework, in kindergarten.,It's not that hard --nhere's the apple, here's the orange,,the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff. 
 Another thing is the answernwas there all along,,but we kind of ignored itnbecause of this obvious thing.,It was an intuitive,nstrongly held belief that was wrong.,In the case of the solar system,,the idea that the Earth is spinning,,the surface is goingna thousand miles an hour,,and it's going through the solar systemnat a million miles an hour --,this is lunacy; we all knownthe Earth isn't moving.,Do you feel like you're movingna thousand miles an hour?,If you said Earth was spinningnaround in space and was huge --,they would lock you up,nthat's what they did back then.,So it was intuitive and obvious.nNow, what about evolution? 
 Evolution, same thing.,We taught our kids the Bible saysnGod created all these species,,cats are cats; dogs are dogs;npeople are people; plants are plants;,they don't change.,Noah put them on the arknin that order, blah, blah.,The fact is, if you believe in evolution,nwe all have a common ancestor.,We all have a common ancestornwith the plant in the lobby!,This is what evolution tells us.nAnd it's true. It's kind of unbelievable.,And the same thing about tectonic plates.,All the mountains and the continents,are kind of floating aroundnon top of the Earth.,It doesn't make any sense. 
 So what is the intuitive,nbut incorrect assumption,,that's kept us from understanding brains?,I'll tell you. It'll seem obviousnthat it's correct. That's the point.,Then I'll make an argument whynyou're incorrect on the other assumption.,The intuitive but obvious thing is:,somehow, intelligencenis defined by behavior;,we're intelligentnbecause of how we do things,and how we behave intelligently.,And I'm going to tell you that's wrong.,Intelligence is defined by prediction. 
 I'm going to work younthrough this in a few slides,,and give you an examplenof what this means.,Here's a system.,Engineers and scientistsnlike to look at systems like this.,They say, we have a thing in a box.nWe have its inputs and outputs.,The AI people said, the thing in the boxnis a programmable computer,,because it's equivalent to a brain.,We'll feed it some inputs and get itnto do something, have some behavior.,Alan Turing defined the Turing test,nwhich essentially says,,we'll know if something's intelligentnif it behaves identical to a human --,a behavioral metricnof what intelligence is,that has stuck in our mindsnfor a long time. 
 Reality, though --nI call it real intelligence.,Real intelligencenis built on something else.,We experience the worldnthrough a sequence of patterns,,and we store them, and we recall them.,When we recall them,nwe match them up against reality,,and we're making predictions all the time.,It's an internal metric;nthere's an internal metric about us,,saying, do we understand the world,nam I making predictions, and so on.,You're all being intelligent now,nbut you're not doing anything.,Maybe you're scratching yourself,nbut you're not doing anything.,But you're being intelligent;nyou're understanding what I'm saying.,Because you're intelligentnand you speak English,,you know the word at the end of this,sentence. 
 The word came to you;nyou make these predictions all the time.,What I'm saying is,,the internal predictionnis the output in the neocortex,,and somehow, predictionnleads to intelligent behavior.,Here's how that happens:,Let's start with a non-intelligent brain.,I'll argue a non-intelligent brain,nwe'll call it an old brain.,And we'll say it'sna non-mammal, like a reptile,,say, an alligator; we have an alligator.,And the alligator hasnsome very sophisticated senses.,It's got good eyes and earsnand touch senses and so on,,a mouth and a nose.,It has very complex behavior.,It can run and hide. It has fearsnand emotions. It can eat you.,It can attack.nIt can do all kinds of stuff.,But we don't considernthe alligator very intelligent,,not in a human sort of way. 
 But it has all this complexnbehavior already.,Now in evolution, what happened?,First thing that happenednin evolution with mammals,is we started to develop a thingncalled the neocortex.,I'm going to represent the neocortexnby this box on top of the old brain.,Neocortex means "new layer."nIt's a new layer on top of your brain.,It's the wrinkly thingnon the top of your head,that got wrinkly because it got shovednin there and doesn't fit. 
 (Laughter) 
 Literally, it's about the sizenof a table napkin,and doesn't fit, so it's wrinkly.,Now, look at how I've drawn this.,The old brain is still there.,You still have that alligator brain.nYou do. It's your emotional brain.,It's all those gut reactions you have.,On top of it, we have this memory systemncalled the neocortex.,And the memory system is sittingnover the sensory part of the brain.,So as the sensory inputncomes in and feeds from the old brain,,it also goes up into the neocortex.,And the neocortex is just memorizing.,It's sitting there saying, I'm goingnto memorize all the things going on:,where I've been, people I've seen,nthings I've heard, and so on.,And in the future, when it seesnsomething similar to that again,,in a similar environment,nor the exact same environment,,it'll start playing it back:n"Oh, I've been here before,",and when you were here before,nthis happened next.,It allows you to predict the future.,It literally feeds backnthe signals into your brain;,they'll let you seenwhat's going to happen next,,will let you hear the wordn"sentence" before I said it.,And it's this feedingnback into the old brain,that will allow you to makenmore intelligent decisions. 
 This is the most important slidenof my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little.,And all the time you say,n"Oh, I can predict things,",so if you're a rat and you gonthrough a maze, and you learn the maze,,next time you're in one,nyou have the same behavior.,But suddenly, you're smarter;nyou say, "I recognize this maze,,I know which way to go; I've been herenbefore; I can envision the future.",That's what it's doing.,This is true for all mammals --,in humans, it got a lot worse.,Humans actually developednthe front of the neocortex,,called the anterior part of the neocortex.,And nature did a little trick.,It copied the posterior,nthe back part, which is sensory,,and put it in the front.,Humans uniquely haventhe same mechanism on the front,,but we use it for motor control. 
 So we're now able to do very sophisticatednmotor planning, things like that.,I don't have time to explain,nbut to understand how a brain works,,you have to understand how the first partnof the mammalian neocortex works,,how it is we store patternsnand make predictions.,Let me give youna few examples of predictions.,I already said the word "sentence.",In music, if you've heard a song before,,when you hear it, the next notenpops into your head already --,you anticipate it.,With an album, at the end of a song,nthe next song pops into your head.,It happens all the time,nyou make predictions. 
 I have this thing callednthe "altered door" thought experiment.,It says, you have a door at home;,when you're here, I'm changing it --,I've got a guy back at your housenright now, moving the door around,,moving your doorknob over two inches.,When you go home tonight, you'll putnyour hand out, reach for the doorknob,,notice it's in the wrong spot,and go, "Whoa, something happened.",It may take a second,nbut something happened.,I can change your doorknobnin other ways --,make it larger, smaller, changenits brass to silver, make it a lever,,I can change the door;nput colors on, put windows in.,I can change a thousand thingsnabout your door,and in the two secondsnyou take to open it,,you'll notice something has changed. 
 Now, the engineering approach,nthe AI approach to this,,is to build a door databasenwith all the door attributes.,And as you go up to the door,nwe check them off one at time:,door, door, color ...,We don't do that.nYour brain doesn't do that.,Your brain is makingnconstant predictions all the time,about what will happennin your environment.,As I put my hand on this table,nI expect to feel it stop.,When I walk, every step,nif I missed it by an eighth of an inch,,I'll know something has changed.,You're constantly making predictionsnabout your environment.,I'll talk about vision, briefly.,This is a picture of a woman.,When we look at people, our eyes saccadenover two to three times a second.,We're not aware of it,nbut our eyes are always moving.,When we look at a face, we typicallyngo from eye to eye to nose to mouth.,When your eye moves from eye to eye,,if there was somethingnelse there like a nose,,you'd see a nose where an eyenis supposed to be and go, "Oh, shit!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "There's something wrongnabout this person.",That's because you're making a prediction.,It's not like you just look over and say,n"What am I seeing? A nose? OK.",No, you have an expectationnof what you're going to see. 
 Every single moment.,And finally, let's thinknabout how we test intelligence.,We test it by prediction:nWhat is the next word in this ...?,This is to this as this is to this.nWhat is the next number in this sentence?,Here's three visions of an object.nWhat's the fourth one?,That's how we test it.nIt's all about prediction. 
 So what is the recipe for brain theory?,First of all, we have to haventhe right framework.,And the framework is a memory framework,,not a computational or behavior framework,,it's a memory framework.,How do you store and recallnthese sequences of patterns?,It's spatiotemporal patterns. 
 Then, if in that framework,nyou take a bunch of theoreticians --,biologists generallynare not good theoreticians.,Not always, but generally, there's notna good history of theory in biology.,I've found the best peoplento work with are physicists,,engineers and mathematicians,,who tend to think algorithmically.,Then they have to learnnthe anatomy and the physiology.,You have to make these theoriesnvery realistic in anatomical terms.,Anyone who tells you their theorynabout how the brain works,and doesn't tell you exactlynhow it's working,and how the wiring works --,it's not a theory. 
 And that's what we donat the Redwood Neuroscience Institute.,I'd love to tell you we're makingnfantastic progress in this thing,,and I expect to be back on this stagensometime in the not too distant future,,to tell you about it.,I'm really excited;nthis is not going to take 50 years. 
 What will brain theory look like?,First of all, it's goingnto be about memory.,Not like computer memory --nnot at all like computer memory.,It's very different.,It's a memory of verynhigh-dimensional patterns,,like the things that come from your eyes.,It's also memory of sequences:,you cannot learn or recall anythingnoutside of a sequence.,A song must be heardnin sequence over time,,and you must play it backnin sequence over time.,And these sequencesnare auto-associatively recalled,,so if I see something, I hear something,nit reminds me of it,,and it plays back automatically.,It's an automatic playback.,And prediction of future inputsnis the desired output.,And as I said, the theorynmust be biologically accurate,,it must be testablenand you must be able to build it.,If you don't build it,nyou don't understand it. 
 One more slide.,What is this going to result in?,Are we going to really buildnintelligent machines?,Absolutely. And it's going to bendifferent than people think.,No doubt that it's goingnto happen, in my mind.,First of all, we're going to buildnthis stuff out of silicon.,The same techniques we use to buildnsilicon computer memories,,we can use here.,But they're very differentntypes of memories.,And we'll attachnthese memories to sensors,,and the sensors will experiencenreal-live, real-world data,,and learn about their environment. 
 Now, it's very unlikely the first thingsnyou'll see are like robots.,Not that robots aren't useful;npeople can build robots.,But the robotics part is the hardest part.nThat's old brain. That's really hard.,The new brain is easiernthan the old brain.,So first we'll do thingsnthat don't require a lot of robotics.,So you're not going to see C-3PO.,You're going to see thingsnmore like intelligent cars,that really understandnwhat traffic is, what driving is,and have learned that carsnwith the blinkers on for half a minute,probably aren't going to turn. 
 (Laughter) 
 We can also do intelligentnsecurity systems.,Anytime we're basically using our brainnbut not doing a lot of mechanics --,those are the thingsnthat will happen first.,But ultimately, the world's the limit.,I don't know how this will turn out.,I know a lot of people who inventednthe microprocessor.,And if you talk to them,,they knew what they were doingnwas really significant,,but they didn't really knownwhat was going to happen.,They couldn't anticipatencell phones and the Internet,and all this kind of stuff.,They just knew like,n"We're going to build calculators,and traffic-light controllers.,But it's going to be big!",In the same way, brain sciencenand these memories,are going to be a verynfundamental technology,,and it will lead to unbelievable changesnin the next 100 years.,And I'm most excited aboutnhow we're going to use them in science.,So I think that's all my time -- I'm over,,and I'm going to end my talk right there.I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?,And you should be really afraid,,but not for the reasons why you think you should be.,You should be really afraid that --,if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.,Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and,thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,,you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.,And this is what this adventure's really about.,This is crystallized DNA.,Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant,,every animal, every human, every politician -- (Laughter),is coded in that stuff.,And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.,And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.,And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.,It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.,If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,,or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,,it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant,and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.,And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.,(Laughter) 
 It turns out that what this stuff is --,and Richard Dawkins has written about this --,is, this is really a river out of Eden.,So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells,is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.,And we could start dating things,,and we could start changing medicine and archeology.,It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,,white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.,White Europeans were subject to the plague.,And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,,but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.,And that mutation was passed on to their kids,because they're the ones that survived,,so there was a great deal of population pressure.,In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,,you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.,We can date it to 700 years ago.,That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,,and not as fast across Europe.,And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,,for sickle cell, for cancers.,And in the measure that we map ourselves,,this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.,And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,,and I want you to toast these two people.,Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,,and that is almost as important a date,as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,,but anyway, we'll get to that. 
 I thought we'd talk about the new zoo.,So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,,but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty,because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.,If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,,it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.,And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,,which is part of the reason,why this whole species-mapping project is so important.,Because we're just beginning to learn,where we came from and what we are.,And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.,And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,,except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,,which is what makes you you,,as far as gene code inside each of your cells,,and this little amoeba which, you know,,sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,,turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.,So, this little thingamajig has a genome,that's 200 times the size of yours.,And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,,it may not turn out to be chips.,It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba. 
 And, again, we're learning from life and how life works.,This funky little thing: people didn't used to think,that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors,because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.,And then finally somebody picked up a microscope,and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.,And sitting next to that water in the cores,was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,,having its chromosomes blown apart every day,,six, seven times, restitching them,,living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.,And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse,and how important and how interesting this journey into life is,,and how many different life forms there are,,and how there can be different life forms living in,very different places, maybe even outside of this planet.,Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,,that brings up a whole series of interesting questions. 
 This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.,We should have known that this existed,because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.,So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.,It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.,And what you're looking at with this namibiensis,is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.,So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.,Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.,We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo. 
 This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.,The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,,lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,,and excretes sulfuric acid.,So, when you think of odd life forms,,when you think of what it takes to live,,it turns out this is a very efficient life form,,and they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones.",And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up,when this planet was covered,by things like sulfuric acid in batteries,,and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.,So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins,that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey. 
 Your fear should be that you are not,,that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.,I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.,Whether the humans survive or don't survive,,these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.,And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA,that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure,that we've ever been on. 
 And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.,Conservation group gets together,,tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.,They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is,they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,,take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,,reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.,When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.,We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,,and the Australians -- bless their hearts --,are playing with these things. 
 Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.,These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.,But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code,and how to reprogram species,,we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.,And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,,then we can put a full string of DNA together.,And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,,we may give birth to an animal,that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.,And then you can start going back further,,and you can start thinking about dodos,,and you can think about other species.,And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out,what the primordial ancestor is.,Because each of us contains our entire gene code,of where we've been for the past billion years,,because we've evolved from that stuff,,you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,,and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,,maybe we'll give birth to something,that is very close to the first primordial ooze.,And it's all coming out of things that look like this. 
 These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.,Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.,Some are public. Some are private.,It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.,Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.,We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.,That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.,And it will be really boring. It will read like this.,(Laughter),The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.,And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.,Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,,you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.,That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.,But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,,and this apple works the same way.,This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.,Because this thing codes ones and zeros,,and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,,absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day,it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?,(Laughter),And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,,it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,,AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.,Next line of code: make a stem.,Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,,that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.,In the measure that you have the code,and the measure that you read it --,and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;,the first human was read two years ago;,the first insect was read two years ago. 
 The first thing that we ever read was in 1995:,a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.,In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,,you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms,so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,,or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,,which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester,that feels like silk in corn.,This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.,This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.,And what you can do now is,,you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,,and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,,and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,,and then you can tie it to the literature.,And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,,and get on the Internet, and access,the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.,And you can do some pretty strange things,because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,,if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,,he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.,Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.,(Laughter) 
 The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings,is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,,and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.,Not so in human beings:,you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.,But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,,each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research,and if we don't stop genomic research,,to express different body functions.,And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,,and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,,one of the things we're going to be able to do,is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,,and one of the things we're going to learn how to do,is how to reprogram cells like stem cells,in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.,And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --,on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,,in some places in the world where they don't stop the research. 
 How's this stuff work? If each of you differs,from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,,which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,,very small differences in expression and punctuation,can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.,(Laughter),Right?,That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,,and they look at that sentence, and they read this.,Okay?,Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.,This is the way it should be seen.,(Laughter),That's what your genes are doing.,That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.,Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...,I won't go there.,You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.,You can look at this, right?,And they look at the world a little differently.,They look at the same world and they say...,(Laughter),That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,,mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.,Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.,You can make very small changes in gene code,and get really different outcomes,,even with the same string of letters.,That's what your genes are doing every day.,That's why sometimes a person's genes,don't have to change a lot to get cancer. 
 These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.,They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.,That brings up questions of privacy and insurability,and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,,because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,,it turns out that three diseases with,completely similar clinical syndromes,are completely different diseases.,Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.,In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,,and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.,And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,,then you take Gleevec and you're cured.,If it is not expressing in your body,,if you don't have one of those types --,a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.,It won't do anything for you.,Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.,Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.,Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.,Changes the way medicine works. 
 The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college,was this thing, and it turns out that,this is not so important any more.,The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,,contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company,every month on a compound basis.,Let me say that again: A single genomics company,generates more data in a month, on a compound basis,,than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.,This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.,So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months,and the power doubles, right?,Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed,with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,,Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.,This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.,This is going to push computers to have to grow faster,than they've been growing, because so far,,there haven't been applications that have been required,that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does. 
 And here's an interesting map.,This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.,One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,,who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.,Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits,moving inside from the United States to the United States;,about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;,about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication,between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.,It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;,they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.,So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.,That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.,In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.,You can break this out by states.,And you can watch states rise and fall depending on,their ability to speak a language of life,,and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,,and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,,and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.,And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.,And if you want to get more specific,,it's actually specific zip codes.,(Laughter) 
 So, you want to know where life is happening?,Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.,And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,,and it's called Torrey Pines Road.,That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;,it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;,and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country,in about three or four carefully picked 747s. 
 Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --,oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.,What's the net effect of this?,In an agricultural society, the difference between,the richest and the poorest,,the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?,Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids,and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,,you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,,than your neighbor.,In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.,It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing,in English and French and German,,but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.,And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.,So, if there is something you should fear,,it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.,Because it really matters who speaks life.,That's why nations rise and fall. 
 And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,,the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.,And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,,and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --,beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.,And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation,on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth,per person per year than America.,Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.,Just smart people moving bits. Different rules. 
 Here's differential productivity rates.,Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.,So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,,790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?,It's got nothing to do with inflation.,It's got nothing to do with privatization.,You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,,stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country,because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.,Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.,Well, watch what happens to India.,India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy,just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.,Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth,because they didn't get this change,,because they kept treating their people like serfs,instead of like shareholders of a common project.,They didn't keep the people who were educated.,They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.,Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say,that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.,Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.,(Laughter) 
 Here's what's happening in the world.,It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,,when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.,It turns out there's now about 192.,Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --,and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.,In the 1990s, these are sovereign states,that did not exist before 1990.,And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.,We're generating about 3.12 states per year.,People are taking control of their own states,,sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.,And the really interesting thing is,,you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,,and you don't need a lot to do it.,(Music),And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk,about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,,and how code works.,Moderator: Two minutes.,(Laughter),Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year,because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.,But thank you very much.So, about three years ago I was in London,,and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,,I represent a group of people,,and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.,We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.,We want to be in the forefront fields,,and we want to do it differently.,We want to get out of this thing,where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power,and decide what science gets done.,It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea. 
 Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics,in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had.,And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away,because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here.,(Laughter),But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time,is take you on a quick tour of some of the things,that we talk about and we think about.,So, we think a lot about what really makes science work?,The first thing that anybody who knows science,,and has been around science,,is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method,is wrong. There is no method.,On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together,as a community, from incomplete evidence,to conclusions that we all agree about.,And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do. 
 So how does it work?,Well, my belief is that it works,because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.,And here are some of the ethical principles.,I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.,I’m in entertain, amaze mode.,(Laughter) 
 But one of the principles is that everybody,who is part of the community gets to fight and argue,as hard as they can for what they believe.,But we’re all disciplined by the understanding,that the only people who are going to decide, you know,,whether I’m right or somebody else is right,,are the people in our community in the next generation,,in 30 and 50 years.,So it’s this combination of respect,for the tradition and community we’re in,,and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,,that makes science work.,And being in this process of being in a community,that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,,I believe, teaches us about democracy.,Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science,and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,,but there has been, historically, a relationship,between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,,and how people think about the society that they live in. 
 And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.,The first science of cosmology that was anything like science,was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.,The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,,the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,,where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.,And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything,goes to its natural place, which was of course,,the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,,and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,,embraced Aristotle and blessed it.,And the idea is that everything is defined.,Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,,the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,,perfect realm, where lives God,,who is the ultimate judge of everything. 
 So that is both Aristotelian cosmology,,and in a certain sense, medieval society.,Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about,space and time and motion and so forth of Newton.,And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought,of John Locke and his collaborators.,And they were very closely associated.,In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.,Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,,and a society on the other hand, were closely related. 
 And let me show you.,In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you.,There are particles and they move around,with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.,It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,,because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,,but with respect to this absolute notion of space,,which for Newton was God. 
 Now, similarly, in Locke’s society there are individuals,who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,,and those are defined with respect to some absolute,,abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,,which are independent of what else has happened in the society.,Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.,There is also an omniscient observer,who knows everything, who is God,,who is in a certain sense outside the universe,,because he has no role in anything that happens,,but is in a certain sense everywhere,,because space is just the way that God knows,where everything is, according to Newton, OK? 
 So this is the foundations of what’s called, traditionally,,liberal political theory and Newtonian physics.,Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution,that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,,and which is still going on.,It was begun with the invention,of relativity theory and quantum theory.,And merging them together to make the final quantum theory,of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,,something that’s going on right now.,And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.,This universe is described by being a network of relationships. 
 Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say,absolutely where something is.,There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.,And this network of relations is ever-evolving.,So we call it a relational universe.,All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.,And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships,,your view of the world has to do with what information,comes to you through the network of relations.,And there’s no place for an omniscient observer,or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.,So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.,This is also, if you talk to legal scholars,,the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.,They’re thinking about the same things.,And not only that, they make the analogy,to relativity theory and cosmology often.,So there’s an interesting discussion going on there.,This last view of cosmology is called the relational view. 
 So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe,,which means that there’s no place,to put an explanation for something outside.,So in such a relational universe,,if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured,,like this device here, or that device there,,or something beautiful, like all the living things,,all of you guys in the room --,"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.,(Laughter) 
 Then you want to know, you’re a person,,you want to know how is it made.,And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.,There must be mechanisms of self-organization,inside the universe that make things.,Because there’s no place to put a maker outside,,as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.,So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization. 
 Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization,that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.,So it works. But not only that,,if you think about how natural selection works,,then it turns out that natural selection,would only make sense in such a relational universe.,That is, natural selection works on properties,,like fitness, which are about relationships,of some species to some other species.,Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,,and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe. 
 So a theory of biology based on natural selection,requires a relational notion of,what are the properties of biological systems.,And if you push that all the way down, really,,it makes the best sense in a relational universe,where all properties are relational.,Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us,that gravity is the result of the world being relational.,If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life,,because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,,keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,,out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve. 
 In the 20th century,,we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.,In the biological sciences, they explored,the implications of the notion that order and complexity,and structure arise in a self-organized way.,That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.,And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,,the human sciences, economics, et cetera.,At the same time, we physicists,have been busy trying to make sense of,and build on and integrate the discoveries,of quantum theory and relativity. 
 And what we’ve been working out is the implications, really,,of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.,21st-century science is going to be driven,by the integration of these two ideas:,the triumph of relational ways of thinking,about the world, on the one hand,,and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,,on the other hand.,And also, is that in the 21st century,our thinking about space and time and cosmology,,and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.,And what they’re evolving towards is the union,of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism. 
 Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective,,a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes,that there are many different interests, many different agendas,,many different individuals, many different points of view.,Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded,in a network of relationships.,Any actor in a democracy is embedded,in a network of relationships.,And you understand some things better than other things,,and because of that there’s a continual jostling,and give and take, which is politics.,And politics is, in the ideal sense,,the way in which we continually address,our network of relations in order to achieve,a better life and a better society. 
 And I also think that science will never go away and --,I’m finishing on this line.,(Laughter),In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard,,and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?",Most people will say, "Emotions are terribly hard.,They're incredibly complex. They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.,But thinking is really very straightforward:,it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.,But that's not the hard part." 
 So here's a list of problems that come up.,One nice problem is, what do we do about health?,The other day, I was reading something, and the person said,probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West.,And there was a little study about people who don't handshake,,and comparing them with ones who do handshake.,And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake,,because they must be hiding.,And the people who avoid that,have 30 percent less infectious disease or something.,Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent.,So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth,,let's start with that. And since I got that idea,,I've had to shake hundreds of hands.,And I think the only way to avoid it,is to have some horrible visible disease,,and then you don't have to explain. 
 Education: how do we improve education?,Well, the single best way is to get them to understand,that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.,And then, of course, you have to do something,about how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you.,Pollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty.,How do we make stable societies? Longevity.,Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about. 
 Anyway, the question I think people should talk about --,and it's absolutely taboo -- is, how many people should there be?,And I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million.,And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear.,If you had 100 million people,properly spread out, then if there's some garbage,,you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot.,Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.,The problem is, how many people should there be?,And it's a sort of choice we have to make. 
 Most people are about 60 inches high or more,,and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big,,by using nanotechnology, I suppose --,(Laughter),-- then you could have a thousand times as many.,That would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody,doing any research on making people smaller.,Now, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children.,And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off.,You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23,from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out,,but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage,and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people,and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need,,and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says,which one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes,any more, even. So each child has 46 parents,,and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children.,Wouldn't that be enough? And then the children,would get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring,,and the world population would decline very rapidly,and everybody would be totally happy. 
 Timesharing is a little further off in the future.,And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice,,called "Against the Fall of Night" and "The City and the Stars.",They're both wonderful and largely the same,,except that computers happened in between.,And Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, "Well, that was wrong.,The future must have some computers.",So in the second version of it, there are 100 billion,or 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies,,or whatever they have in the future.,And you let a few million of them out at a time.,A person comes out, they live for a thousand years,doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back,for a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter --,but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time.,And you get to think about yourself and your memories,,and before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories,and you change your personality and so forth.,The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity,,so that the people who designed the city,make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created.,And in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says,,maybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system. 
 I don't think the solutions that I proposed,are good enough or smart enough.,I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough,to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough.,Therefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL.,As you remember, at some point in the book for "2001,",HAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound,for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior,with the triviality of the people on the spaceship,,you can see what's written between the lines.,Well, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter.,I think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees,,but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face,,either in abstract mathematics,or in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around.,So one thing we can do is live longer.,And nobody knows how hard that is,,but we'll probably find out in a few years.,You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live,twice as long as chimpanzees almost,,and nobody lives more than 120 years,,for reasons that aren't very well understood.,But lots of people now live to 90 or 100,,unless they shake hands too much or something like that.,And so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills,and knowledge to solve some problems.,So that's one way of going about it.,And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be --,after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee,,so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times,the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates,,we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees,,in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash,,maybe by just a few hundred genes. 
 What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet.,And whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics,that's published within your lifetime, or something.,(Laughter),The stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science.,And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes,,we can live 200 years.,Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40,,and I doubt that it's several hundred.,So this is something that people will be discussing,and lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody,who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind.,(Laughter),And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change,worth making, because he says, what about the consequences?,And, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences,of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones.,And yet two random people will mate and have this child,,and both of them have some pretty rotten genes,,and the child is likely to come out to be average.,Which, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed. 
 If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth,problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years,,then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.,And so there won't be any workforce.,And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have,,is that a society that doesn't have people,of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse,,because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old.,And when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course,,I don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image,of what a 200-year-old is -- which is dead, actually. 
 You know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain,which seem to have different functions.,Nobody knows how most of them work in detail,,but we do know that there're lots of different things in there.,And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory,that most of them are cancelling each other out.,And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city,with a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example,,you may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply,and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal.,You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac --,all you care about is not stepping out on that platform.,And when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth.,So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability.,Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state,is what you get when you remove 100 or 200,of your normally available resources. 
 So thinking of emotions as the opposite of -- as something,less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope,,in the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines.,And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details,on how we might make those smart machines and --,(Laughter),-- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine,is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you.,This is a problem of such and such a type,,and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking,that are good for that problem.,So I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify,types of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles,and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up.,So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian --,we lost the first hundred years of psychology,by really trivial theories, where you say,,how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is,,after we go through a lot of levels, including designing,a huge, messy system with thousands of ports,,we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology.,Saying, not what are the situations,,but what are the kinds of problems,and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them,,how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person,invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. 
 So, I think in the next 20 years,,if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence,,like neural nets and genetic algorithms,and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say,,can we make a system that can use all those things,for the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets;,we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them.,Genetic algorithms are great for certain things;,I suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you.,(Laughter) 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just,quickly start out with,a little bit of music here. (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you! (Applause) 
 I took my shoes off to dance,,but maybe I'll get at that later.,Anyways, I... where to start?,Well, I'm really excited,to talk a bit about,my own upbringing in music,and family and all of that,,but I'm even more excited for you people,to hear about Donnell's amazing family,and maybe even a little bit about,how we met,,and all that sort of thing,,but for those of you that may not,be familiar with my upbringing,,I'm from Cape Breton Island,,Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,,which is a very, very musical island,,and its origins come from Scotland,with the music and all the traditions,,the dancing, the language,,which unfortunately is dying out,in Cape Breton.,The traditional language is Gaelic,,but a lot of the music came,from the Gaelic language,,and the dancing and the singing,and everything, and my bloodline,is Scottish through and through,,but my mother and father,are two very, very musical people. 
 My mom taught me to dance,when I was five, and my dad,taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.,My uncle is a very well-known,Cape Breton fiddler.,His name's Buddy MacMaster,,and just a wonderful guy,,and we have a great tradition at home,called square dancing,,and we had parties, great parties,at our house and the neighbors' houses,,and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.,Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,,but kitchen party,in Cape Breton is very common,,and basically somebody drops into the house,,and no matter what house you go to,in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,,guaranteed, and I'd say,,well there's first of all more fiddlers,per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere,in the world, so ten chances to one,,the fellow who walked in the door,could play it, so you'd have someone come,into the house, you'd invite them to play,a tune, and lo and behold,a little party would start up and somebody would dance,,and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,,so it was a wonderful, wonderful way,to grow up, and that is where,my beginnings in music come from:,my surroundings, my family,,just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,,I've done lots of things with my music. 
 I've recorded lots of CDs.,I was nominated for a Grammy and,I've won some awards and stuff like that,,so that's awesome,,but the best part was meeting my husband,,and I've actually known Donnell,for probably 12 years now, and,I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,,how music brought us together,,but I'm going to introduce you,right now to my new husband,as of October 5,,Donnell Leahy. (Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED,experience and I'm glad to be here,,but I'm just trying to put it all together,,trying to figure all you people out, and I've,been here for a short while, and I'm starting,to understand a little bit better.,So I asked Natalie, what do I do?,And she said, just talk about yourself. 
 It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little,bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers,and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,,an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,,and we grew up on a farm.,Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,,and I'm the oldest boy.,There are four girls a little bit older than me.,We grew up without a television.,People find that strange,,but I think it was a great blessing for us.,We had a television for a few years,,but of course we wasted so much time,and the work wasn't getting done,,so out went the television. 
 We grew up playing—,Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.,Mom and Natalie's mother,knew each other. We grew up playing,,and used to dance together, right, yeah.,(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,,we played by ear and I think,that's important for us because,we were not really exposed to a lot of,different styles of music. 
 We learned to play the instruments,,but we kind of had to come from within,or go from within, because we didn't,watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of,radio. We went to church,and to school sometimes,,and farmed and played music,,so we were able, I think,,at a very critical age to develop,our own style, our own self,,and my mother plays, my father plays,,and the style that came,from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,,we call it French-Canadian style,but it originated in logging camps.,Years ago, hundreds of men would go,up for the winter to the camps,in Northern Ontario and in Quebec,,and they were all different cultures,,and the Irish, the French, Scottish,,German, they'd all meet, and of course,at night, they'd play cards,and step dance and play fiddles,,and over the course of many years,,the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved,and the Ottawa Valley step dancing,evolved, so that's, I kind of started out,with that style and I quickly,started doing my own thing,,and then I met Natalie, and I was,exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.,That's how we met. (Laughter),You tell them. (Laughter) 
 NM: You want to or no? (Laughter),Well I guess I have to now.,Well, it's just so interesting that,Donnell's upbringing was very similar,to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play,when I was about 12 years old,,and he and his family came to,Inverness, which is about 45 minutes,from where I lived, and I was just,blown away, like, it was just amazing,,and you'll find out why pretty soon here,,but I couldn't believe the fiddling,and Mom was there with me,,and she was saying —,Donnell's mother came up on stage,and danced with her children, and Mom,was saying, "That's Julie MacDonnell,,I used to dance with her when we,were kids. Little did I think our children,would be playing instruments, you know,,playing music, yeah." 
 Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think,her kids would be getting married,,but anyway, so, then I got,a phone call about, I dunno,,seven years later. I was 19,,first or second year of college,,and it was Donnell, and,he said "Hi, you probably don't know me,but my name is Donnell Leahy.",And I said, "I know you.,I have a tape of yours at home.",And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro,",which is where I was,,and he asked me out for supper.,That's it. (Laughter),(Applause),Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs),(Laughter),Then we dated for two years,,broke up for 10, got back together,and got married. (Laughter) (Applause) 
 DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,,so I'll just get to it.,I'm going to play a piece of music for you.,It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.,I starts out with a slow air.,Airs were played in Europe,at burials, as a body was carried out,from the wake site to the burial site,,the procession was led by a piper,or a fiddle player.,I'll quickly play a short part of the air,,and then I'm going to get into,kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult,to play when you're not warmed up,,so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it,anyway. It's called The Banks. 
 (Tuning) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 NM: Well, we're gonna play one,together now. (Applause),We're laughing, like, because,our styles are totally different,,as you can hear.,And so, you know, Donnell and I,are actually in the process of,writing new pieces of music together,that we can play,,but we don't have any of those ready.,We just started yesterday. (Laughter),So we're gonna play something together anyway. 
 DL: With one minute. 
 NM: With one minute. 
 (Audience reaction) 
 DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,,because you've got to do your thing. 
 (Music) 
 NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on. 
 (Tuning) 
 NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or,the bird pose right now. (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 (Audience claps along) 
 (Applause) 
 Announcer: Great news,,they're running late downstairs.,We've got another 10 minutes.,(Applause) 
 NM: Okay. Sure.,All right, okay.,Let's get her going. (Applause) 
 (Tuning) 
 DL: What do you want to play? 
 NM: Well, um... 
 (Music) (Laughter) 
 NM: Uh, sure. 
 DL: How fast? 
 NM: Not too fast. 
 (Music) 
 (Audience claps along) 
 (Cheering) 
 (Audience claps along) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 DL: We're going to play a tune,and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.,The Cape Breton piano playing,is just awesome. It's very rhythmic,and, you'll see it.,My mom plays piano, and she learned,to play before they had a piano at home,in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had,a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play,the rhythms on a piece of board,,and the fiddlers would all congregate,to play on the cold winter's evenings,and Mom would be banging on this board,,so when they bought a piano,,they bought it in Toronto and had it taken,by train and brought in on a horse,,a horse and sleigh to the house.,It became the only piano in the region,,and Mom said she could basically play,as soon as the piano arrived,,she could play it because she had learned,all these rhythms. Anyway, we found,the piano last year and were able to,bring it back home. We purchased it.,It had gone through, like,,five or six families,,and it was just a big thing for us,,and we found actually an old picture,of somebody and their family years ago.,Anyway, I'm blabbering on here. 
 NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy. 
 DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter) 
 NM: Just tell them what— 
 DL: She wants me to talk about—,We have a band named Leahy.,There's 11 siblings. We, um—,What will I tell them? (Laughter),We opened— 
 NM: No surgeries. 
 DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.,We had a great opportunity.,We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.,It was a big thing for us, and now,all my sisters are off having babies,and the boys are all getting married, so we're,staying close to home for, I guess,,another couple of weeks.,What can I say? I don't know what to say,,Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 NM: Is this what marriage is about?,(Applause),I like it. (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 DL: Oh yeah, okay,,in my family we had seven girls, four boys,,we had two fiddles and one piano,,and of course we were all fighting to play,on the instruments, so dad and mom,set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone,off the instrument. You had to wait,until they were finished, so of course,,what we would do is we'd get on the piano,and you wouldn't even get off to eat,,because you wouldn't want to give it up,to your brother or sister, and they'd wait,and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight,and you'd be still sitting there on the piano,,but it was their way to get us to practice.,Will we play a tune? 
 NM: It worked. DL: It worked.,Sorry, I hate to carry on...,So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.,Okay, play in, how about A? 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,,which are the two primary factors --,not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --,which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --,bordering on the inevitable at this point,,whether one is in favor of that or not --,that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves,better conceptualized as kinds of technology,,and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider,in the space of conceptual design. 
 Here's what I mean. Politics and --,let's focus on the political system in particular question here,,which is the system of democracy.,Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology,for the control and deployment of power.,You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.,The famous ones -- despotism is a good one;,anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,,to do it in a radically diffused fashion;,and democracy is a set of technologies,,which have the effect of, in principle,,diffusing the power source to a large number of people,and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,,and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern,by virtue of what the broader public has done. 
 Now, consider religion -- in this case Islam,,which is the religion that, in some direct sense,,can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.,Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,,because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.,I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.,At the beginning of the Bush administration,,when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,,he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.,In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.,That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.,After 9/11, the tables were turned.,And the president decided, with his advisors,,to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.,That began with Afghanistan,,and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,,a decision was made through the technology of democracy --,again, notice, not a perfect technology --,but through the technology of democracy,that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --,this time, a war in Iraq. 
 Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war",is that we have to acknowledge that Islam,,as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,,was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --,the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --,and as a consequence, at one degree of remove,,the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.,And I would add that bin Laden and his followers,are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,,or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,,and the world of Islam as they see and define it. 
 Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?,Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.,It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe,in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,,but it's also meant by the Islamists --,and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --,they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,,whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.,Within the sphere of people who have that view,,and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world,who disagree with bin Laden in his application,,but agree that Islam is the answer.,Islam represents a way of engaging the world,through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.,And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,,peace, justice and equality,,but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings. 
 Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression,by identifying either of these propositions --,rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.,I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.,And I think a good way to prove this,is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was,when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.,And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:,you can't show a picture of democracy.,You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.,You can show the Capitol --,I had the same problem when I was designing the cover,of my forthcoming book, in fact --,what do you put on the cover to show democracy?,And the same problem with respect to Islam.,You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,,but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.,That's because these are the kinds of concepts,that are not susceptible to easy representation. 
 Now, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.,It follows from that that all of the people in the world,who say that they are Muslims can, in principle,,subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations,of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.,In other words, unlike the word hope,,which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,,and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,,these are essentially contested concepts.,They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.,And as a consequence of this disagreement,,it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,,"I have the right version of Islam.",You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon,of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace.",Well, so says George W. Bush.,Other people would say it means something else.,Some people would say that Islam means submission.,Other people would say it means an acknowledgement,or recognition of God's sovereignty.,There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.,And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.,Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections.,Other people say no, that's not enough,,there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.,These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,,"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean." 
 Now, if Islam and democracy are at present,in a moment of great confrontation,,what does that mean?,Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.,You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,,which was fear.,Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner,and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die,as a consequence of this confrontation --,a confrontation which many, many people,in the Muslim world do not want,,many, many people in the American democracy do not want,,many people elsewhere in the world do not want,,but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --,at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --,to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.,And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response. 
 What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes,is that there's also a hopeful response to this.,And the hopeful response derives from recognizing,that Islam and democracy are technologies.,And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.,And they're manipulable in ways,that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.,What do I have in mind?,Well, all over the Muslim world there are people,who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,,for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,,or just a source of powerful personal identity,,who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy,are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.,And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --,disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.,And they furthermore think overwhelmingly --,again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,,and one can find this by reading any of the sources,that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet,and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying,that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves,to have choice in the spheres of personal life,,in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,,and, yes, in the sphere of religion,,which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world. 
 And many of these Muslims further say,that their disagreement with the United States,is that it, in the past and still in the present,,has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world,in order to promote America's short-term interests.,Now, during the Cold War, that may have been,a defensible position for the United States to take.,That's an academic question.,It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,,and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.,And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,,and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.,But now that the Cold War is over,,there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --,and pretty close to the same here in the United States,,if you talk to people and ask them --,that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.,And we see this among activist, practical Muslims,,like the Muslims who are presently the elected,,parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,,who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,,who are promoting their own religious values,,who are elected by their own people,because they were perceived as honest and sincere,because of their religious values,,but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance,are fundamentally incompatible. 
 Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam,convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible,with what we consider the core of democracy --,namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.,But I'm here to tell you that technologies,are more malleable than that.,I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --,the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say,that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,,namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty,and basic human equality before God,,are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.,And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.,And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.,But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.,And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument. 
 So, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt,try to form a party known as the Center Party,,which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.,They weren't even allowed to form a party.,They were actually blocked from even forming a party,under the political system there. Why?,Because they would have done extraordinarily well.,In the most recent elections in the Muslim world --,which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco,and those in Turkey -- in each case,,people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats,were far and away the most successful vote-getters,every place they were allowed to run freely.,So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race,but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.,So had they contested a larger number of the seats,,they would have done even better.,Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case,is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.,And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --,who care very, very deeply about their traditions,,who do not want to compromise those values --,believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy,and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,,that these two ideas can work together. 
 Now what would that look like?,What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?,Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical,to democracy as we know it in the United States.,That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --,for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.,It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,,or Muslims out in the rest of the world --,I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --,conceptualize Islam.,It will be transformative of Islam as well.,And as a result of this convergence,,this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,,there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash,of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --,and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --,we'll in fact have close compatibility. 
 Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,,and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war,if you're talking about these issues.,The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing,because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,,many Muslims will conclude that the United States,is not the kind of place that they want to emulate,with respect to its forms of political government.,On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,,swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think,that Islam is the enemy somehow --,that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.,And even though, for political tactical reasons,,the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,,nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war,to think of the other side as an enemy.,And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,,in defining who that enemy is.,So the risks are very great. 
 On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war,are also not to be underestimated,,even by, and I would say especially by, people,who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.,Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,,it cannot be the right strategy,,either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,,"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,,because we opposed the war in the first place.",That's not the way human circumstances operate.,You face the circumstances you have in front of you,and you go forward. 
 Well, what I'm here to say then is,,for people who are skeptical about the war,,it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war,there is a possibility for the government of the United States,and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts,to create real forms of government that are truly democratic,and also truly Islamic.,And it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --,for people who care about these issues to make sure,that within the technology of democracy, in this system,,they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices,to encourage that outcome.,That's a hopeful message,,but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it,as incurring serious obligation for all of us.,And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,,but only if we put what we can into it.,And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether. 
 Thanks.I am known best for human-powered flight,,but that was just one thing that got me going,in the sort of things that I'm working in now.,As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,,ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,,indoor models, outdoor models, everything,,which I just thought was a lot of fun,,and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.,And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,,I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,,and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,,but got tangled up with some great professor types,,who convinced me and everybody else in the field,that this was a good way to get into really deep science. 
 While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,,although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.,The weather modification subject was getting started,,and as a graduate student,,I could go around to the various talks that were being given,,on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,,and so on. And everybody would talk to me,,but all the professionals in the field hated each other,,and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,,I got the absolutely unique background in that field,,and started a company, which did more research,in weather modification than anybody,,and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.,But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --,then one or two, three,,and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.,We had AirDynamisis,,who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies,on some big, many year project,,and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew. 
 The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,,I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane,because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,,or I guaranteed the money at the bank.,He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.,The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,,and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,,and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,,which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --,17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,,which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars. 
 So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --,(Laughter) --,and did not -- the way I approached it, first,,thinking about ways to make the planes,,was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,,and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.,But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,,just for the fun of it,,and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,,and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,,and immediately, figure out its speed,,and the turning radius, and so on,,which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --,(Laughter) --,with my three sons, young sons, helping me,,but ridiculing the whole thing very much. 
 But that began thinking about how birds went around,,and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,,and then other planes,,and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,,was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,,but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --,70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,,but three times the span, three times the cord.,You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,,and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,,and we won the prize a year later. 
 We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,,and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.,Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,,and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,,about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project. 
 (Laughter) 
 And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.,But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --,that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize,for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.,And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.,We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,,the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,,and if you decrease the power required a little,,the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.,And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,,to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,,and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.,And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.,It turned out that giving the planes to the museum,was worth much more than the debt,,so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.,So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --,(Laughter) -- 
 that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,,and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --,(Laughter) --,because the prizes are all over.,(Laughter),But that sure started me thinking about various things,,and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane,because we felt solar power was going to be so important,for the country and the world,,we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,,which is what the government was trying to do with it.,And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,,but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power,and maybe help that field.,And that project continued, did succeed,,and we then got into other projects in aviation,and mechanical things and ground devices. 
 But while this was going on,,in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --,their annual prize --,and I had to prepare a paper on it,,which collected all my varied thoughts,and varied interests over the years.,This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,,and what was important. And to my surprise,,I realized the importance of environmental issues,,which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,,and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.,I thought back about if I was a space traveler,,and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.,And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,,the little differences in the Earth. 
 But this last time, just coming round, right now,,suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,,in the concentration of people,,and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.,I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,,we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,,and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,,with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,,will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,,and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation. 
 I wanted to show the slide --,this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --,(Laughter),(Applause) --,it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.,And so, the year 2000, you see there.,And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.,Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --,the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.,The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.,Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass,of vertebrates on land and air.,And you don't know what the future will hold,,but it's not going to get a lower percentage.,Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets,were not even one tenth of one percent,and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.,Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth. 
 I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,,and ask them, after they've asked me questions,,and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.,What's the population of the Earth?,What's the population of the Earth going to be,when you're the age of your parents?,Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about,but, now, they think about it.,And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium,that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?,And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,,and when I leave, two hours later,,most of them are saying about 2 billion people,,and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,,nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem. 
 Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with "Silent Spring," way back.,"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,,claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,,from solar energy and water, and so on.,You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,,and we can do things much more efficiently.,Let's have the next slide.,So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,,on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --,complex and probable, wonderful and fragile. 
 Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,,no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,,have grown in population, technology and intelligence,to a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush.",We're in charge. It's frightening.,And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.,(Laughter),And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,,in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;,and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV,and traffic jams and so on.,I have no idea of what comes next,,so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,,as a little warning.,And two weeks after this drawing was done,,we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,,on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me. 
 (Laughter),(Paper rustling) 
 Well, that'll be all the slides.,As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.,We focused more on the really serious energy problems,of the future, and we produced products for the company.,And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,,the EV1, out of --,and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations,that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.,And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.,I have a Helios. We have the first video. 
 (Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747. 
 (Music) 
 Her designers' attention to detail and her construction,gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength,to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.,This enables her to easily ride through the air currents,as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves. 
 Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think. 
 (Laughter) 
 Narrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,,to maximize the power from her solar array. 
 (Music),As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop,below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,,the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey,has gone by without notice,,except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems,and their associated sensors.,Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,,at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.,This is more than 10,000 feet higher,than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird. 
 (Applause) 
 PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,,and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.,Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,,for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,,but only ten miles above the Earth.,Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum. 
 (Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.,In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,,a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead,if the operator is remote from the vehicle.,It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.,Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.,It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.,With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,,and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage. 
 PM: Okay, and let's have the next. 
 (Applause) 
 That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.,Let's have the next video. 
 (Video) (Music) 
 Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head. 
 (Music) 
 We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus,by meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,,helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago. 
 Tyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours. 
 AA: When they got bored with their father's project,,they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own. 
 TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other. 
 AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider. 
 (Music) 
 I've never seen anything like that.,How old were you when you invented that? 
 TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.) 
 TM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.) 
 PM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong. 
 (Applause) 
 TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,,and one of the first things,,the production version seemed to dive a little bit,,and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit,before you try flying it.,I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.,The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.,As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so,as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.,And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.,The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,,and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then also, like it said in the video,,you can turn it left or right,just by putting the lift under one wing or another.,So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, this one will be a left turn.,Here, but --,(Applause) --,anyway.,(Applause),And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,,and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,,so you have real collector's items. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this, we just wanted to show you --,if we can get the video running on this, yeah --,just an example of a little video surveillance. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was flying around in the party last night, and --,(Laughter) --,you can see how it just can fly around,,and you can spy on anybody you want. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,,but I was worried about hitting people in here,,so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.,And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.,(Applause),All right.To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.,(Laughter),You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.,And you're on the outside, you're at home.,You're like the Raspyni Brothers,,where you've got your balls in cold water. And --,(Laughter) --,you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.,And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.,It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time,and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.,And you want to go back and do it again.,But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,,and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible. 
 So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,,within the subject of creation and optimism.,And if you put creation and optimism together,,you've got two choices that you can talk about.,You can talk about creationism --,which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,,at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --,or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.,And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.,But any kind of conversation about architecture --,which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,,setting up TED, small-scale architecture --,at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,,the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us. 
 Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,,which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,,what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation,that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?,And our own opportunity to make something new there?,This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.,I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,,brought architecture into focus,in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,,and made it a subject for common conversation.,I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,,a time when five people sat me down at a table,and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,,safety concerns and whether carpet burns.,These are just not things we talked about very often.,And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.,At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,,you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.,And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,,we're going to think about it like this. 
 How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.,There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.,They've made a selection.,They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,,the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.,Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,,and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,,and now to an even larger instrument,,upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,,as you see here.,He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,,after six previous firms struck out,with things that were so stupid and banal,that even the city of New York was forced to go,,"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.",Right. Can we do this again from the top,,except use some people with a vague hint of talent,,instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,,real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.,Let's bring in some real architects for a change.,And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's too late. That is gone.,This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,,and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.,This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:,a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.,Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,,because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction,by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.,But that's what we're going to do.,But I want you to think about these things,in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,,and that these two things talk about very specifically.,And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,,in trying to decide whether we want architecture,from the kind of technocratic solution to everything --,that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,,be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --,or something that's more of a romantic solution. 
 Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.,I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.,So, in the American tradition,,the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,,would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's,Cartesian grids spreading across the United States,,that gives us basically the whole shape,of every western state in the United States,,as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --,in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.,Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.,Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?,Manifest destiny. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,,it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.,And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.,I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.,We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?,Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one,the moment they saw one.,And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,,rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,,and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why? Why? Why do you want to do that?,Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's in our nature to go ricocheting,back and forth between this technocratic solution,and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.,So we're going to go straight into this.,Can I have the lights off for a moment?,I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly,that represent the current split, architecturally,,between these two traditions of a technocratic,or technological solution and a romantic solution.,And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.,One very young, one a little more mature.,This is the work of a firm called SHoP,,and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings,of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.,Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?,Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses,that takes a picture of the outside world --,it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --,and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. 
 This is just the outline of it, and you can see,,does it look like a regular building? No.,It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,,square, rectangular, anything like that,,that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.,The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,,has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,,traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.,What's interesting about it is not the shape.,What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.,A brand-new way to put buildings together,,something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.,What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,,is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.,That's why we all live in developer houses.,They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.,That's because it's cheaper. 
 Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,,a program that says, manufacture these parts.,The computer then talks to a machine --,a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --,that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,,because the computer is just a machine.,It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.,It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.,It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,,so the parts can all be cut at the same time.,Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,,which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,,what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,,like you used to get when you were a child,,when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D.",And so what the builder will get is every single individual part,that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck,to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.,Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.,Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --,and that's what will happen in the end. 
 You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.,Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,,these same architects were asked to produce something,for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,,as part of their young architects summer series.,And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?,In the summer, you go to the beach.,And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.,So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.,So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.,They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,,and that computer program shaped a sand dune,and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --,at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --,a set of instructions for pieces of wood.,And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.,These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up. 
 What you can see is there's about six different colors,,and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.,All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,,and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,,only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.,Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.,And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,,and there it is fully built.,There are only 16 different pieces of wood,,only 16 different assembly parts here.,Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.,It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.,It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.,It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,,where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long. 
 Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,,this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,,replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,,that very important pedestrian connection,between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.,They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,,building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.,And they were able to do it. That was their design,,using that same computer modeling system,and only five or six really different kinds of parts,,a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material,and a very simple framing system,that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.,They were able to create that.,They were able to create something wonderful.,They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,,using the same technology.,Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.,It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,,so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.,Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,,and you get the same kind of grandeur. 
 Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.,Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.,This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,,whose work you can see out here today.,The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work,in a very different fashion.,It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you,into something that you can do, into something that will please you,,something that will lift your spirits,,something that will make you feel as if are in another world --,such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,,which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City,to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.,"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.,Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
 I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.,Every single surface of this restaurant is white.,The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.,It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.,Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.,This is happening by itself.,It transforms through the magic of lighting.,It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.,Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,,up on the Upper West Side,,with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.,Let's see it one more time.,Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.,And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good,in places that you wouldn't have felt good before.,It's about bringing nature to the inside. 
 In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --,I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world,to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space,of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.,It's about stimulation.,This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.,Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,,all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.,And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters,for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,,where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,,look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.,And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives,at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.,And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now,,where we don't have robots everywhere.,Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future --,assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.,And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,,are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?,Are they going to be around in 50 years?,Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.,And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.,I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common,,and I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years,,where the first few robots are starting to appear. 
 Computers sort of came around through games and toys.,And you know, the first computer most people had in the house,may have been a computer to play Pong,,a little microprocessor embedded,,and then other games that came after that.,And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots:,LEGO Mindstorms, Furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a Furby?,Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.,They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot,,a simple robot with some sensors,,a little bit of processing actuation. 
 On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.,And just as in the early days,,when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers,,you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.,And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,,where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI,to wander around your house and do various stuff.,And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys --,the Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,,the PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.,But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there. 
 And we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots,,Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.,And then in the last 12 months or so,we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.,The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot,from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive --,3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it. 
 But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.,Another one from Karcher.,At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab,about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.,And let me just show you that.,We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.,This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.,And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.,If it hits something -- you people see that?,Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet,to clean up around me. Let's see, let's --,oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!,(Laughter),Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!,(Laughter),See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.,It's grown-ups that get really upset.,(Laughter),We'll just put some crap here.,(Laughter),Okay.,(Laughter),I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,,I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.,Yeah, OK. So --,we'll leave that for later.,(Applause) 
 Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually;,the intelligence on board was fairly simple.,And that's true with a lot of robots.,We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,,and think that computation is everything,,but the mechanics still matter.,Here's another robot, the PackBot,,that we've been building for a bunch of years.,It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops --,looking at caves, for instance.,But we had to make it fairly robust,,much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.,(Laughter),On board that robot is a PC running Linux.,It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:,it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,,can go upstairs by itself, et cetera.,Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.,A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.,That was not a controlled descent.,(Laughter),Now it's going to head off.,And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.,We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.,Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,,things were just too -- there was nothing left to do.,But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,,and searched for possible survivors in the buildings,that were too dangerous to go into.,Let's run this video.,Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.,Nick Robertson has that story.,Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?,Okay, good.,So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.,He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.,The robot's being totally autonomous.,The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far,was one of the robots fell down ten meters. 
 So one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.,Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.,And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.,There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.,Thanks.,And over the next couple of months,,we're going to be sending robots in production,down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.,Very hostile environments, 150˚ C, 10,000 PSI.,Autonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.,But robots like this, they're a little hard to program.,How, in the future, are we going to program our robots,and make them easier to use?,And I want to actually use a robot here --,a robot named Chris -- stand up. Yeah. Okay.,Come over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.,He sort of does that. But I'm going to --,Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh.,(Laughter),(Applause),I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.,Now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication,he was understanding the flow of communication.,And if I'd said something completely bizarre,he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.,So now I brought this up in front of him.,I'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.,And I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.,His eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at --,so we've got shared attention.,And so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me,to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle,,and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that?,(Laughter),Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.,I didn't show you how to do that.,Now see if you can put it back together.,(Laughter),And he thinks a robot has to be really slow.,Good robot, that's good. 
 So we saw a bunch of things there.,We saw when we're interacting,,we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.,The other thing communicates their internal state to us,,whether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.,There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing,,and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.,And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots,because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.,I just want to show you one technical diagram here.,The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially,is its visual attention system.,Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing,and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.,So in the videos I'm about to show you,,you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot,which has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space,,so it works across all human colorings.,It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.,And it looks for things that move around.,And it weights those together into an attention window,,and it looks for the highest-scoring place --,the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening --,and that is what its eyes then segue to.,And it looks right at that.,At the same time, some top-down sort of stuff:,might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone,,or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.,And so these weights change. 
 And over here on the right,,this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.,Did people see the movie "AI"? (Audience: Yes.) 
 RB: Yeah, it was really bad, but -- 
 remember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot,,looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?,Well, this gets rid of that,,because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative,,and more and more intense as it looks at one thing.,And it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.,So, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's Kismet,,looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at.,You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera,,and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.,And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.,(Laughter),But it's still going to pay attention,if something more significant comes into its field of view --,such as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.,It sees her, pays attention to her.,Kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space,,a vector space, of where it is emotionally.,And at different places in that space, it expresses --,can we have the volume on here?,Can you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.) 
 Kismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so?,Do you really think so? 
 RB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face,and the prosody in its voice.,And when I was dealing with my robot over here,,Chris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice,,and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages,that mothers give their children pre-linguistically.,Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot: 
 Voice: Nice robot.,You're such a cute little robot.,(Laughter),RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately. 
 Voice: ...very good, Kismet.,(Laughter) 
 Voice: Look at my smile. 
 RB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot.,These are naive subjects.,Here we asked them to get the robot's attention,and indicate when they have the robot's attention. 
 Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is. 
 RB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention.,Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh. 
 RB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot,,and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. 
 Voice: No. No. You're not to do that. No.,(Laughter) 
 Not appropriate. No. No.,(Laughter) 
 RB: I'm going to leave it at that. 
 We put that together. Then we put in turn taking.,When we talk to someone, we talk.,Then we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes,,give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.,And then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.,So we put this in the robot.,We got a bunch of naive subjects in,,we didn't tell them anything about the robot,,sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.,Now what they didn't know was,,the robot wasn't understanding a word they said,,and that the robot wasn't speaking English.,It was just saying random English phonemes.,And I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this,,where this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes --,(Laughter),-- says, "I want to show you something.,I want to show you my watch.",And he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision,,points to it, gives it a motion cue,,and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.,We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot --,Notice the turn-taking.,Ritchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch,that my girlfriend gave me.,Robot: Oh, cool.,Ritchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.,(Laughter),RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.,Ritchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure.,RB: And they successfully have that sort of communication. 
 And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing.,This is another robot, Cog.,They first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy,,the robot estimates her gaze direction,and looks at the same thing that she's looking at.,(Laughter),So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot,over the next few years in labs.,But then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are:,if we make these robots more and more human-like,,will we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually?,And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?,(Laughter),And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme,with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here --,where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.,Well, do you ever need to give robots respect?,They're just machines, after all.,But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.,After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.,You don't see a description of how, you know,,Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.,And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges,,and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.,It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.,If we are machines, then in principle at least,,we should be able to build machines out of other stuff,,which are just as alive as we are.,But I think for us to admit that,,we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.,And we've had the retreat from special-ness,under the barrage of science and technology many times,over the last few hundred years, at least.,500 years ago we had to give up the idea,that we are the center of the universe,when the earth started to go around the sun;,150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.,And to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us.,Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe,we didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth,,which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said,,maybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really --,people didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.,We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know,,having the idea that robots could really have emotions,,or that robots could be living creatures --,I think is going to be hard for us to accept.,But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so. 
 And the second question is, will the machines want to take over?,And here the standard scenario is that we create these things,,they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us,,and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.,They want to take over from us.,And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.,(Laughter),But Hollywood extends it to the robots.,And the question is, you know,,will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?,And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard,,you know -- "I accidentally built a 747.",I don't think that's going to happen.,And I don't think --,(Laughter),-- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots,that we're uncomfortable with.,We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.,Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot,,and before that a not so bad robot.,(Laughter),And we're just not going to let it go that way.,(Laughter),So, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming,,we don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun,,and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.,(Applause)You know, I am so bad at tech,that my daughter -- who is now 41 --,when she was five, was overheard by me,to say to a friend of hers,,If it doesn't bleed when you cut it,,my daddy doesn't understand it.,(Laughter),So, the assignment I've been given,may be an insuperable obstacle for me,,but I'm certainly going to try. 
 What have I heard,during these last four days?,This is my third visit to TED.,One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,,was a regular TED two years ago.,I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing,that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,,and what that is is an interweaving,and an interlarding, an intermixing,,of a sense of social responsibility,in so many of the talks --,global responsibility, in fact,,appealing to enlightened self-interest,,but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.,One of the most impressive things,about what some, perhaps 10,,of the speakers have been talking about,is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:,Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.,It's: This is what I have done,because I'm excited by it,,because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me,and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.,It's the old concept, the real Greek concept,,of philanthropy in its original sense:,phil-anthropy, the love of humankind. 
 And the only explanation I can have,for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days,is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.,And this gives me enormous hope.,And hope, of course, is the topic,that I'm supposed to be speaking about,,which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.,And when I did, I thought,,well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.,So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library,,which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,,and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,,none of which really hits you,between the eyes as being the appropriate one.,And, of course, that makes sense,,because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,,it's not a concrete word. 
 Well, it reminds me a little bit of surgery.,If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.,If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.,And that's the way it is with definitions of words.,If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.,If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,,and Joe Schmo does it one way,and Will Blow does it another way,,and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.,They all come down to the idea of an expectation,of something good that is due to happen.,And you know what I found out?,The Indo-European root of the word hope,is a stem, K-E-U --,we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy --,and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.,But what it means in the original Indo-European,is a change in direction, going in a different way. 
 And I find that very interesting and very provocative,,because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days,is the sense of going in different directions:,directions that are specific and unique to problems.,There are different paradigms.,You've heard that word several times in the last four days,,and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.,So, when we think of hope now,,we have to think of looking in other directions,than we have been looking.,There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope,that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel,in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,",in which he says that hope,does not consist of the expectation that things will,come out exactly right,,but the expectation that they will make sense,regardless of how they come out. 
 I can't tell you how reassured I was,by the very last sentence,in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.,I wasn't sure I heard it right,,so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.,He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.,I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?",He said, "I think so.",So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.,"The world will not be saved by the Internet.",It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?,I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.,And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,,I don't mean anything supernatural --,certainly not coming from this skeptic.,What I mean is this ability,that each of us has,to be something greater than herself or himself;,to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something,that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.,On an elemental level, we have all felt,that spirituality at the time of childbirth.,Some of you have felt it in laboratories;,some of you have felt it at the workbench.,We feel it at concerts.,I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.,It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.,And I think that it's going to be, in time,,the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about,bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.,And if there's anything that has permeated this room,,it is precisely that. 
 I'm intrigued by,a concept that was brought to life,in the early part of the 19th century --,actually, in the second decade of the 19th century --,by a 27-year-old poet,whose name was Percy Shelley.,Now, we all think that Shelley,obviously is the great romantic poet that he was;,many of us tend to forget that he wrote,some perfectly wonderful essays, too,,and the most well-remembered essay,is one called "A Defence of Poetry.",Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,,and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,,but somewhere on the second page,he begins talking about the notion,that he calls "moral imagination.",And here's what he says, roughly translated:,A man -- generic man --,a man, to be greatly good,,must imagine clearly.,He must see himself and the world,through the eyes of another,,and of many others.,See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself. 
 What is it that is expected of us,by the billions of people,who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day,so appropriately called,despair and disparity?,What is it that they have every right,to ask of us?,What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,,out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?,Well, you know precisely what it is.,There's a great deal of argument,about whether we, as the great nation that we are,,should be the policeman of the world,,the world's constabulary,,but there should be virtually no argument,about whether we should be the world's healer.,There has certainly been no argument about that,in this room in the past four days. 
 So, if we are to be the world's healer,,every disadvantaged person in this world --,including in the United States -- becomes our patient.,Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,,becomes our patient.,So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient.",It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.,So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,,and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen --,we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,,it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N. 
 So, the lesson is very clear. The lesson is that our patient --,the world, and the disadvantaged of the world --,that patient deserves our compassion.,But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,,is our moral imagination,and our identification with each individual,who lives in that world,,not to think of them as a huge forest,,but as individual trees.,Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree,be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get --,can get in the way.,(Laughter),So, here we are.,We are, should be,,morally committed to,being the healer of the world.,And we have had examples over and over and over again --,you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes --,of people who have not only had that commitment,,but had the charisma, the brilliance --,and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God --,the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning,of their quest,,and who no doubt will continue to succeed,,as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause. 
 Now, if we're talking,about medicine,,and we're talking about healing,,I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.,It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:,Pogo's been quoted;,Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.,I would like to quote one of my own household gods.,I suspect he never really said this,,because we don't know what Hippocrates really said,,but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians,said the following,,and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,,and the book is called "Precepts.",And I'll read you what it is.,Remember, I have been talking about,,essentially philanthropy:,the love of humankind, the individual humankind,and the individual humankind,that can bring that kind of love,translated into action,,translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.,And here he is, 2,400 years ago:,"Where there is love of humankind,,there is love of healing.",We have seen that here today,with the sense,,with the sensitivity --,and in the last three days,,and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I want to take you back basically to my hometown,,and to a picture of my hometown of the week,that "Emergence" came out.,And it's a picture we've seen several times.,Basically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.,I live right there in the West Village,,so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.,We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours --,we hadn't taken it from somebody else. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences,of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close --,that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all,or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building,,was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written.,Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power,and creative potential of density, of largely urban density,,of connecting people and putting them together in one place,,and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas,and share physical space together. 
 And it seemed to me looking at that -- that tower burning and then falling,,those towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons,here was that density kills.,And that of all the technologies that were exploited,to make that carnage come into being,,probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives,were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings,110 stories above the ground.,If they hadn't been crowded --,you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,,and you can see that very powerfully.,And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density --,I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call. 
 And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.,And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,,and you could sense that the air was not healthy.,And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village,where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,,a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,,which was located about 20 blocks away, north.,And so I went out.,And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) --,so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.,And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me,as I was walking north to buy this air filter,,which was that the streets were completely alive with people. 
 There was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day,,as it was for about a week after,,and the West Village had never seemed more lively.,I walked up along Hudson Street --,where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book,that so influenced what I was writing in "Emergence" --,past the White Horse Tavern,,that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,,and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.,And all the people who lived in the neighborhood,,who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,,were all out there -- had them all open.,People were out.,There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.,And it was a beautiful urban day,,and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.,The city was there.,All the things that make a great city successful,and all the things that make a great city stimulating --,they were all on display there on those streets. 
 And I thought, well, this is the power of a city.,I mean, the power of the city --,we talked about cities as being centralized in space,,but what makes them so strong most of the time,is they're decentralized in function.,They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out,and cause the whole thing to fail.,If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.,I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,,was destroyed by the attacks,,and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.,But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,,the city had never looked more alive.,If you'd gone into the minds of the people,,well, you would have seen a lot of trauma,,and you would have seen a lot of heartache,,and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover. 
 But the system itself of this city was thriving.,So I took heart in seeing that.,So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,,and how some of those reasons kind of map,on to where the Web is going right now.,The question that I found myself asking to people,when I was talking about the book afterwards is --,when you've talked about emergent behavior,,when you've talked about collective intelligence,,the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that,is to ask, who builds a neighborhood?,Who decides that Soho should have this personality,and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?,Well, there are some kind of executive decisions,,but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody.,Everybody contributes a little bit.,No single person is really the ultimate actor,behind the personality of a neighborhood. 
 Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive,post-9/11 in my neighborhood?,Well, it was the whole city.,The whole system kind of working on it,,and everybody contributing a small little part.,And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web,in a bunch of interesting ways --,most of which weren't around, actually,,except in very experimental things,,when I was writing "Emergence" and when the book came out.,So it's been a very optimistic time, I think,,and I want to just talk about a few of those things.,I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity,that's starting to emerge online right now. 
 And the old one looked like this.,This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.,It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online,who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus,and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" -- those are his links.,But nothing really says,this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real,,the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than,"Click here for a picture of my dog.",That is -- you know, there's no sentence,that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,,which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog,and link to it, and somebody reading the page,has the power to click on that link or not click on that link. 
 And, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense --,to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday --,that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that,powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:,that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,,and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.,But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.,There's one person putting up the link, and there's another person,on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.,The new model is much more like this,,and we've already seen a couple of references to this.,This is what happens when you search "Steven Johnson" on Google.,About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough --,one of my great, kind of shining achievements --,which is that my website finally became a top result for "Steven Johnson.",There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson,who has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say. 
 (Laughter) 
 And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,,but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.,It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.,Because effectively, what's happening here,,what's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this,,but it's worth just thinking about it --,is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,,but rather somehow the entire web of people,putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,,and Google just sitting there and running the numbers.,So there's this collective decision-making that's going on.,This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,,and Google is just helping us,kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place. 
 Now, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative --,but there are some new twists on this.,There's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati --,that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.,And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.,He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.,And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,,and so you have kind of an authority --,a weblog that has a lot of links to it,is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.,And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,,you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?,And you can get a list.,This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.,You can also rank it by the latest posts. 
 So when I was talking in "Emergence,",I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture,that, basically, you could link to somebody else,but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.,And that was one of the reasons why the web,wasn't quite as emergent as it could be,because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism,to be able to really do interesting things.,Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.,Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,,where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --,there's nothing artificial.,He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,,if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.,And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page "like a tree fungus." 
 And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.,I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati,on the right-hand side of my page,,and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.,That little list there would change.,I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.,So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,,wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.,Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain,that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.,And there are all these interesting tools.,Google does the Google Zeitgeist,,which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,,and they publish it with lots of fun graphs.,And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,,so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing. 
 There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,,which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching,for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.,The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.,Well, you know, we should expect to see that.,That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.,So the key thing in terms of these new tools,that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,,that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --,the question is, are you finding out something new? 
 And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share,which is basically, you take an abstract term,,and you search Google for that term,,and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.,So basically, the number of pages that mention this term,,that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages,is that person's Google Share of that term.,So you can do kind of interesting contests.,Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.,So Richard Saul Wurman,has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.,Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.,And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.,I had no idea.,No, that's not true.,(Laughter),I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide,of the Mola mola fish. 
 (Laughter) 
 I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel --,but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.,So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,,so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.,Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.,So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.,But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search,and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.,So Gary Bauer is not too far behind --,has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.,And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So --,(Laughter),you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.,And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,,I think, right there. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,,I think it would be good next year.,Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing,,but this analysis some of you may have seen.,It just came out. This is bursty words,,looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.,So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,,so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,,that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.,So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --,slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.,That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.,They're talking about slavery in 1860.,1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.,And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.,1985, right at the center of the Reagan years --,that's, we're, there's, we've, it's. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that,"emancipation" and "depression" and "recovery" all have a lot of syllables.,So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.,But seriously, actually, what you can see there,,in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,,is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country,and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic --,contracting all those verbs.,You know, 20 years before it was still, "Ask not what you can do,",but with Reagan, it's, "that's where, there's Nancy and I," that kind of language.,And so something we kind of knew,,but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.,I'll go very quickly.,The question now -- and this is the really interesting question --,is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now,in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs,because they are really kind of at the cutting edge. 
 And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.,Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky,that got a lot of attention about a month ago,,and this is basically the distribution of links,on the web to all these various different blogs.,It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,,and a long tail of blogs with very few links.,So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.,Now this is a very interesting thing.,It's caused a lot of controversy,because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,,one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard. 
 And so the question is, "Why is this happening?",It's not being imposed by fiat from above.,It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.,Now, what's great about it is that people are working on --,within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing,the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.,And basically, the shape appears,largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.,if you're the first site there, everybody links to you.,If you're the second site there, most people link to you.,And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,,and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,,and then you get this kind of shape.,And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,,literally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece --,was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.,And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,,that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours. 
 So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.,So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.,And it creates a kind of planned emergence.,You're not totally in control,,but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways,because you have an end result which is,maybe a more democratic spread of voices.,So the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note --,is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems,are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern,and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.,So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate,about power laws and software that could change it,is the fact that we're having the conversation.,I hope it continues here.,Thanks a lot.I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,,asking you to join me by stepping off the land,and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.,90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,,and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.,And it's a lively and a lovely place,,but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --,not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,,our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,,but also, most recently, with climate change,,and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.,Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,,more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating,will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.,And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for. 
 Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,,and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,,but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi,is just not going to fill you up.,About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.,So it may be good for the waistline,,but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.,And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish,isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,,that is, unless you eat jellyfish.,And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack,on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.,And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,,whose primary prey are jellyfish. 
 This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records",for being the world's heaviest bony fish.,It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.,And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here,that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --,that its favorite food is the moon jelly.,So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,,even if one is eating the other.,Now this is typically how you see sunfish,,this is where they get their common name.,They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.,They just lay out on the surface of the sea,and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,,they lie out and bask on the surface. 
 Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,,but it's actually Latin for millstone,,and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.,It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.,And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,,was this terribly bizarre shape.,You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,,and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --,they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,,and then you look at the sunfish. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --,it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.,So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?,Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense,except in the light of evolution.,The Mola's no exception.,They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,,65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,,and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --,oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.,Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,,about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction,that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --,we're going to head to the high seas.,And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,,and we turn our puffer into the Mola.,You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce. 
 They look -- maybe they look,kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,,but in fact, in fact they are the --,they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,,right up there with flat fish.,They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.,And in terms of fishes --,fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,,just 50 million years ago, so --,so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.,They start as little eggs,,and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again,for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.,A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,,can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --,and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.,And from that little egg,,they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,,and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.,They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.,That's a little diver up there in the corner. 
 They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again,for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.,From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage,till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.,600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,,and you had to feed this thing.,That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.,Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --,we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,,but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --,one of the first places to have them in captivity --,they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.,I said, now, that's a true American. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,,because schooling used to be salvation for fishes,,but it's suicide for fishes now.,But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,,they still get caught in nets as by-catch.,If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,,then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --,how they live their lives, like the Mola.,And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --,up to 26 percent of the drift net.,And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,,they make up up to 90 percent.,So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.,And how do you do that?,How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.,This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land. 
 How do you get insight?,How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?,Well, there's some great new technology,that has just recently become available,,and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.,And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.,That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,,which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.,And it can record this data for up to two years,,and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,,float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,,to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,,and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --,we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.,So the great thing about the Mola,is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --,that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.,And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola. 
 Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.,They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.,I think Donne wrote a poem about that.,But they have 40 genera of parasites,,and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.,And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.,They don't seem to mind, so far.,So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.,We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.,And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,,using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.,We'd love to tag in Monterey.,Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.,Not this time of year -- it's more around October. 
 And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --,but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this,because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.,The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,,rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,,and then tosses them back and forth.,And I'm not exaggerating, it is just --,and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.,And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,,it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.,The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,,so we head down south, to San Diego.,Not so many California sea lions down there.,And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,,and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.,And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there,because it's spa time for the Molas there.,As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.,And they come and give the Molas --,you can see they strike this funny little position that says,,"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage." 
 (Laughter) 
 And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,,and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --,because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.,And it's also a great place to go down south,because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.,I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,,will say, "Okay, scratch me right there.",You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --,and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.,So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;,we've gone over to another part of the Pacific,,and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.,And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.,And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.,We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.,Well, not the one we tagged!,And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,,to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten. 
 So the hardest part of tagging, now, is,after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.,And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,,I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out,during the course that the tag is recording.,The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,,so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.,And so the waiting is really the hardest part.,I'm going to show you our latest dataset.,And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.,And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,,we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?,Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?,And we found that they kind of are homebodies.,They're not big migrators. This is their track:,we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month,kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.,And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.,And that's kind of their home range.,Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,,that population doesn't get replenished.,So that's a very important piece of data. 
 But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.,They're super industrious.,And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --,they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up,and up and down, up to 40 times a day.,As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.,Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.,They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,,and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.,They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,,and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.,And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --,which a whole variety of food's in that layer.,So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,,they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance,between the surface and the bottom and through temperature. 
 We see the same pattern -- now with these tags,we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,,a real three-dimensional play.,This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,,where they're going to be tagging all over the world,and the Mola's going to enter into that.,And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know,the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,,and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.,Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals,and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.,It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist. 
 Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.,I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.,And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,,and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.,But people would write into the site with all sorts of,,all sorts of stories about these animals,and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.,And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --,a shared love and an interest in the oceans.,I was getting reports from Catholic nuns,,Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,,united by their love of life.,And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:,"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.",And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.,If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel,and one of the delights of ethnographic research,is the opportunity to live amongst those,who have not forgotten the old ways,,who still feel their past in the wind,,touch it in stones polished by rain,,taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.,Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,,or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,,or that in the Himalaya,,the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,,is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,,and that is the idea that the world in which we live,does not exist in some absolute sense,,but is just one model of reality,,the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices,that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. 
 And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.,We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.,We go through initiation rites.,We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,,so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,,we all have art. 
 But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,,the rhythm of the dance in every culture.,And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,,or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,,or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,,the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,,or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --,this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with,a month ago --,or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,,Everest, the goddess mother of the world. 
 All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,,other ways of thinking,,other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.,And this is an idea, if you think about it,,can only fill you with hope.,Now, together the myriad cultures of the world,make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life,that envelops the planet,,and is as important to the well-being of the planet,as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.,And you might think of this cultural web of life,as being an ethnosphere,,and you might define the ethnosphere,as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,,ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being,by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.,The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.,It's the symbol of all that we are,and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. 
 And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,,so too is the ethnosphere,-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.,No biologists, for example, would dare suggest,that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are,on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,,and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario,in the realm of biological diversity --,scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario,in the realm of cultural diversity.,And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss. 
 When each of you in this room were born,,there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.,Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary,or a set of grammatical rules.,A language is a flash of the human spirit.,It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture,comes into the material world.,Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,,a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
 And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,,fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.,They're no longer being taught to babies,,which means, effectively, unless something changes,,they're already dead.,What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,,to be the last of your people to speak your language,,to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors,or anticipate the promise of the children?,And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody,somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,,because every two weeks, some elder dies,and carries with him into the grave the last syllables,of an ancient tongue. 
 And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,,wouldn't the world be a better place,if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,,let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.,Let's make it Kogi.",And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like,to be unable to speak your own language. 
 And so, what I'd like to do with you today,is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,,a brief journey through the ethnosphere,,to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.,Now, there are many of us who sort of forget,that when I say "different ways of being,",I really do mean different ways of being. 
 Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,,the people of the anaconda,who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river,from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.,Now, this is a people who cognitively,do not distinguish the color blue from the color green,because the canopy of the heavens,is equated to the canopy of the forest,upon which the people depend.,They have a curious language and marriage rule,which is called "linguistic exogamy:",you must marry someone who speaks a different language.,And this is all rooted in the mythological past,,yet the curious thing is in these long houses,,where there are six or seven languages spoken,because of intermarriage,,you never hear anyone practicing a language.,They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
 Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,,the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,,an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.,In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact,and made a critical mistake.,They dropped from the air,8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves,in what we would say to be friendly gestures,,forgetting that these people of the rainforest,had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.,They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,,tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,,found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards,from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.,But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.,They speared each other.,54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.,We traced genealogies back eight generations,,and we found two instances of natural death,and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,,they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old,that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter),But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge,of the forest that was astonishing.,Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces,and tell you what species left it behind. 
 In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment,when I was asked by my professor at Harvard,if I was interested in going down to Haiti,,infiltrating the secret societies,which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength,and Tonton Macoutes,,and securing the poison used to make zombies.,In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,,I had to understand something about this remarkable faith,of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.,On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.,It's interesting.,If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,,what would you say?,Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever. 
 There's always one continent left out,,the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa,had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did,and Voodoo is simply the distillation,of these very profound religious ideas,that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.,But, what makes Voodoo so interesting,is that it's this living relationship,between the living and the dead.,So, the living give birth to the spirits.,The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,,responding to the rhythm of the dance,to momentarily displace the soul of the living,,so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.,That's why the Voodooists like to say,that "You white people go to church and speak about God.,We dance in the temple and become God.",And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --,how can you be harmed?,So you see these astonishing demonstrations:,Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance,handling burning embers with impunity,,a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind,to affect the body that bears it,when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. 
 Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,,the most extraordinary are the Kogi,of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.,Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,,in the wake of the conquest,,these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif,that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.,In a bloodstained continent,,these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.,To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.,The young acolytes are taken away from their families,at the age of three and four,,sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness,in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:,two nine-year periods,deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation,they spend in their natural mother's womb;,now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.,And for this entire time,,they are inculturated into the values of their society,,values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --,or we might say the ecological -- balance.,And at the end of this amazing initiation,,one day they're suddenly taken out,and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,,they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness,of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes,of the stunningly beautiful landscape,,suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract,is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back,and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.,It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.",They call themselves the "elder brothers",and they say we, who are the younger brothers,,are the ones responsible for destroying the world. 
 Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.,Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,,we either invoke Rousseau,and the old canard of the "noble savage,",which is an idea racist in its simplicity,,or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau,and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.,Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental,nor weakened by nostalgia.,There's not a lot of room for either,in the malarial swamps of the Asmat,or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,,through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth,that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,,but on a far subtler intuition:,the idea that the Earth itself can only exist,because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. 
 Now, what does that mean?,It means that a young kid from the Andes,who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit,that will direct his or her destiny,will be a profoundly different human being,and have a different relationship to that resource,or that place than a young kid from Montana,raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock,ready to be mined.,Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.,What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship,between the individual and the natural world.,I was raised in the forests of British Columbia,to believe those forests existed to be cut.,That made me a different human being,than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth,who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw,and the Crooked Beak of Heaven,and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,,spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. 
 Now, if you begin to look at the idea,that these cultures could create different realities,,you could begin to understand,some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.,It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.,This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,,the most powerful psychoactive preparation,of the shaman's repertoire.,What makes ayahuasca fascinating,is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,,but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:,on the one hand, this woody liana,which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,,harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --,to take the vine alone,is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke,drift across your consciousness --,but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family,called Psychotria viridis.,This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,,very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,,5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.,If you've ever seen the Yanomami,blowing that snuff up their noses,,that substance they make from a different set of species,also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.,To have that powder blown up your nose,is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel,lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter),It doesn't create the distortion of reality;,it creates the dissolution of reality. 
 In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --,who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era,with his discovery of the magic mushrooms,in Mexico in the 1930s --,I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines,as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects,there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter) 
 But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally,because they're denatured by an enzyme,found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.,They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction,with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.,Now, the fascinating things,are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana,are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary,to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.,How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,,do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants,that when combined in this way,,created a kind of biochemical version,of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? 
 Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,",which is exposed to be meaningless.,But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us." 
 Well, what does that mean?,This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,,all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,,all of which are referable to our eye as one species.,And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy,and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.,I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No.",Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties,in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.,Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,,but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter) 
 Now --,(Applause) --,the problem -- the problem is that even those of us,sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people,view them as quaint and colorful,but somehow reduced to the margins of history,as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.,Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,,is not going to be remembered for its wars,or its technological innovations,,but rather as the era in which we stood by,and either actively endorsed or passively accepted,the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity,on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.,All cultures through all time,have constantly been engaged in a dance,with new possibilities of life. 
 And the problem is not technology itself.,The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux,when they gave up the bow and arrow,any more than an American stopped being an American,when he gave up the horse and buggy.,It's not change or technology,that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,,the crude face of domination.,Wherever you look around the world,,you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;,these are dynamic living peoples,being driven out of existence by identifiable forces,that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:,whether it's the egregious deforestation,in the homeland of the Penan --,a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --,a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,,and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution,on the banks of the rivers,,where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt,that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away,to the South China Sea,,where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon,ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --,or, in the case of the Yanomami,,it's the disease entities that have come in,,in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
 Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,,where I'm doing a lot of research recently,,you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.,You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people,is universally condemned, but ethnocide,,the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,,it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated,as part of a development strategy.,And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet,until you move through it at the ground level.,I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China,overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa,with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa,that I understood the face behind the statistics,you hear about:,6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,,1.2 million people killed by the cadres,during the Cultural Revolution.,This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.,That meant he was instantly killed,at the time of the Chinese invasion.,His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora,that took the people to Nepal.,His mother was incarcerated,for the crime of being wealthy.,He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two,to hide beneath her skirt tails,because she couldn't bear to be without him.,The sister who had done that brave deed,was put into an education camp.,One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband,of Mao, and for that transgression,,she was given seven years of hard labor.,The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,,but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. 
 And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:,do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony,or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?,Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,,that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards,this blandly amorphous generic world view,not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination,reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,,but that we would wake from a dream one day,having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
 And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,,been around for [150,000] years.,The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,,at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;,the poetry of the shaman was displaced,by the prose of the priesthood;,we created hierarchy specialization surplus --,is only 10,000 years ago.,The modern industrial world as we know it,is barely 300 years old.,Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me,that we have all the answers for all of the challenges,that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.,When these myriad cultures of the world,are asked the meaning of being human,,they respond with 10,000 different voices. 
 And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility,of being what we are: a fully conscious species,,fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens,find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. 
 This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island,when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,,and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.,The Canadian government has not always been kind,to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,,to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.,This old man's grandfather refused to go.,The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,,all of his tools.,Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;,they took advantage of it.,The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish,wrapped in caribou hide.,So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night,or the blizzard that was blowing.,He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers,and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,,he shaped it into the form of a blade.,He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife,and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.,He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,,took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,,harnessed up an adjacent dog,,and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.,Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter) 
 And this, in many ways --,(Applause) --,is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people,and of all indigenous people around the world.,The Canadian government in April of 1999,gave back to total control of the Inuit,an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.,It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.,It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.,An amazing example of how a nation-state,can seek restitution with its people. 
 And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious,at least to all of all us who've traveled,in these remote reaches of the planet,,to realize that they're not remote at all.,They're homelands of somebody.,They represent branches of the human imagination,that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,,the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,,become part of the naked geography of hope. 
 So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,,is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.,We think that polemics --,(Applause) --,we think that polemics are not persuasive,,but we think that storytelling can change the world,,and so we are probably the best storytelling institution,in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.,156 nations carry our television channel.,Our magazines are read by millions.,And what we're doing is a series of journeys,to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience,to places of such cultural wonder,that they cannot help but come away dazzled,by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,,embrace gradually, one by one,,the central revelation of anthropology:,that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,,that we can find a way to live,in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world,where all of the wisdom of all peoples,can contribute to our collective well-being. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have,and that's that I'm a philosopher. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do,and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.,When I go to an academic cocktail party,and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in,and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I go to a philosopher's party 
 (Laughter) 
 and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,",their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls,because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness.",The very chutzpah of somebody thinking,that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question. 
 My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,,in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,",is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --,the way philosophers go about their business.,And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument.",And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument,for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises,and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,,and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.,Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument,that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.,But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all. 
 It's very hard to change people's minds,about something like consciousness,,and I finally figured out the reason for that.,The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.,We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.,They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.,But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;,they've just got strong opinions.,I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change,and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,,encounter people who have very strong opinions,about what's going to happen next.,But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.,They're just strongly held opinions.,But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,,each of us seems to think, "I am an expert.,Simply by being conscious, I know all about this.",And so, you tell them your theory and they say,,"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!,No, you've got it all wrong.",And they say this with an amazing confidence. 
 And so what I'm going to try to do today,is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --,I can feel it myself.,I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --,that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.,That's the order of the day here. 
 Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.,I think everybody understands what that means.,That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.,This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.,It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.,And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.,That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,,Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.,There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here,and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.,What I particularly like about this picture, too,,is that Steinberg has rendered the guy,in this sort of pointillist style. 
 Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:,what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --,is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.,That's what we're made of.,No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.,Not a single one of those cells is conscious;,not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.,Somehow, we have to explain,how when you put together teams, armies, battalions,of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --,not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --,the result is this. I mean, just look at it.,The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,,there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness,is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.,How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.,They think, "No, there can't be any,sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness." 
 This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,,who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,,and he's an expert magician, and an expert,on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,,"Net of Magic.",And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.,It speaks so eloquently to the problem.,"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?',By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,,thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.,'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.','Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;,while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness. 
 (Laughter) 
 Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.,If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,,then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.,And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,,"Consciousness is a bag of tricks.",This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied,and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.,So this is the problem. So I have to,do a little bit of the sort of work,that a lot of you won't like,,for the same reason that you don't like to see,a magic trick explained to you.,How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --,starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,,you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!,Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.,Don't tell me the answer.",A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.,And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.,You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks. 
 But I'm not going to explain it all to you.,I'm going to do what philosophers do.,Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.,You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?,The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.,You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half." 
 (Laughter) 
 "He merely makes you think that he does.",And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?",He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry." 
 (Laughter) 
 So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.,But I'm going to try to also show you,that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --,your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --,as you may have thought it is.,This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.,He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards,people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.,He didn't even try to do those things.,People's memories inflate what they think they saw.,And the same is true of consciousness. 
 Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.,Watch it carefully.,I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian,named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,,part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.,We're looking for a backer.,It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.,OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?,How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?,Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.,Even when you know that they're all going to change color,,it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate,to pick up any of the changes at all. 
 Now, this is an example -- one of many --,of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.,It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my,1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,",where I said if you did experiments of this sort,,you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.,If there's time at the end,,I'll show you the much more dramatic case.,Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,,and that we're not aware of them?,Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,,the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.,He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,,moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,,looking at interesting things in the world.,And where your eye isn't looking,,you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.,That's because the foveal part of your eye,,which is the high-resolution part,,is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.,That's the detail part.,It doesn't seem that way, does it?,It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.,You're getting in a lot less information than you think. 
 Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.,It's in the museum in North Carolina.,Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.,And I love paintings like that --,the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.,And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,,and you can get right up,and see all the details on the painting.,And I started across the hall in North Carolina,,because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,,and would have all that in detail.,And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --,you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.,And I thought as I got closer,I would be able to see all the detail of most people,,see their clothes, and so forth.,And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.,I yelled out because when I got closer,,I found the detail wasn't there at all.,There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.,And as I walked towards the picture,,I was expecting detail that wasn't there.,The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes,and wagons and all sorts of things,,and my brain had taken the suggestion. 
 You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,,you can get a better view of the blobs.,See, when you get close,they're really just blobs of paint.,You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.,I'll just give that to you one more time. 
 Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?,When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,,suggests a person -- say, one of,Marvin Minsky's little society of mind --,do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?,I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?,Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?,It's the same thing.,The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.,You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.,The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.,It's just making you expect the detail. 
 Let's just do this experiment very quickly.,Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?,Yes.,How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left,in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?,How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.,How do you know that's what you did? 
 (Laughter) 
 There's in fact been a very interesting debate,raging for over 20 years in cognitive science --,various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,,who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.,Yes, it's possible to do that.,But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.,And if you read that literature, one of the things,that you really have to come to terms with is,even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.,You don't know how you do it.,You just know that you have certain beliefs.,And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.,And what explains the fact that that's what you think?,Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician. 
 This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.,You may think that I've cheated,,that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.,How many of you see that sort of boundary,,with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?,Can you see it?,Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.,Your brain is actually computing that boundary,,the boundary that goes right there.,But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?,It's a Necker cube.,Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.,Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?,Because there's another way of seeing it.,If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,,some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.,As a cube, on a black background,,as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese. 
 (Laughter) 
 Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.,When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,,those boundaries go away.,But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.,We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?,Does your brain have to send little painters in there?,The purple-painters and the green-painters,fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.,Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.,When I first started talking about,the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --,I'll go back to it, this one --,I said that there was no filling-in behind there.,And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.,But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't. 
 Now, if you think you see some pale yellow --,I'll run this a few more times.,Look in the gray areas,,and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --,yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.,["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide],This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree,inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.,Let me just pause this for a second if I can. 
 This is change-blindness.,What you're going to see is two pictures,,one of which is slightly different from the other.,You see here the red roof and the gray roof,,and in between them there will be a mask,,which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.,So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,,then the second picture, then a mask.,And this will just continue, and your job as the subject,is to press the button when you see the change.,So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.,Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.,And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,,"I see the change." 
 So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.,We're going to start easy. Some examples.,No trouble there.,Can everybody see? All right.,Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more,than a second to press the button.,Can you see that one?,2.9 seconds.,How many don't see it still?,What's on the roof of that barn? 
 (Laughter) 
 It's easy.,Is it a bridge or a dock?,There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.,I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.,This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.,Can you see it? 
 Audience: Yes. 
 Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.,So 15.5 seconds is the median time,for subjects in his experiment there. 
 I love this one. I'll end with this one,,just because it's such an obvious and important thing.,How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?,How many engines on the wing of that Boeing? 
 (Laughter) 
 Right in the middle of the picture!,Thanks very much for your attention.,What I wanted to show you is that scientists,,using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,,can tell you things about your own consciousness,that you would never dream of,,and that, in fact, you're not the authority,on your own consciousness that you think you are.,And we're really making a lot of progress,on coming up with a theory of mind. 
 Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt,to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.,And he's right. This is a problem.,Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --,director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.,If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.,If you work on two neurons, that's psychology." 
 (Laughter) 
 We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to give younfour specific examples,,I'm going to cover at the end,about how a company called Silkntripled their sales;,how an artist named Jeff Koonsnwent from being a nobody,to making a whole bunch of moneynand having a lot of impact;,to how Frank Gehry redefinednwhat it meant to be an architect.,And one of my biggest failuresnas a marketer in the last few years --,a record label I startednthat had a CD called "Sauce." 
 Before I can do thatnI've got to tell you about sliced bread,,and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.,Now, before sliced breadnwas invented in the 1910s,I wonder what they said?,Like the greatest inventionnsince the telegraph or something.,But this guy named Otto Rohwedderninvented sliced bread,,and he focused, like most inventors did,non the patent part and the making part.,And the thing about the inventionnof sliced bread is this --,that for the first 15 yearsnafter sliced bread was available,no one bought it; no one knew about it;,it was a complete and total failure.,And the reasonnis that until Wonder came along,and figured out how to spreadnthe idea of sliced bread,,no one wanted it.,That the success of sliced bread,,like the success of almost everythingnwe've talked about at this conference,,is not always about what the patentnis like, or what the factory is like --,it's about can you getnyour idea to spread, or not.,And I think that the waynyou're going to get what you want,,or cause the change that you wantnto change, to happen,,is to figure out a waynto get your ideas to spread. 
 And it doesn't matter to menwhether you're running a coffee shop,or you're an intellectual,nor you're in business,,or you're flying hot air balloons.,I think that all this stuff appliesnto everybody regardless of what we do.,That what we are living innis a century of idea diffusion.,That people who can spread ideas,nregardless of what those ideas are, win.,When I talk about itnI usually pick business,,because they make the best picturesnthat you can put in your presentation,,and because it's the easiestnsort of way to keep score.,But I want you to forgive menwhen I use these examples,because I'm talking about anythingnthat you decide to spend your time to do. 
 At the heart of spreading ideasnis TV and stuff like TV.,TV and mass media made it really easynto spread ideas in a certain way.,I call it the "TV-industrial complex.",The way the TV-industrial complex works,nis you buy some ads,,interrupt some people,nthat gets you distribution.,You use the distribution you getnto sell more products.,You take the profitnfrom that to buy more ads.,And it goes around and around and around,,the same way that the military-industrialncomplex worked a long time ago.,That model of,nand we heard it yesterday --,if we could only getnonto the homepage of Google,,if we could only figure outnhow to get promoted there,,or grab that person by the throat,,and tell them about what we want to do.,If we did that then everyone would paynattention, and we would win.,Well, this TV-industrial complex informednmy entire childhood and probably yours.,I mean, all of these products succeedednbecause someone figured out,how to touch people in a waynthey weren't expecting,,in a way they didn'tnnecessarily want, with an ad,,over and over again until they bought it. 
 And the thing that's happened is,nthey canceled the TV-industrial complex.,That just over the last few years,,what anybody who marketsnanything has discovered,is that it's not workingnthe way that it used to.,This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize;nI had a bad cold when I took it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the product in the blue boxnin the center is my poster child.,I go to the deli; I'm sick;nI need to buy some medicine.,The brand manager for that blue productnspent 100 million dollars,trying to interrupt me in one year.,100 million dollars interrupting menwith TV commercials,and magazine ads and Spam,and coupons and shelvingnallowances and spiff --,all so I could ignorenevery single message.,And I ignored every message,because I don't havena pain reliever problem.,I buy the stuff in the yellow boxnbecause I always have.,And I'm not going to invest a minutenof my time to solve her problem,,because I don't care. 
 Here's a magazine called "Hydrate."nIt's 180 pages about water. 
 (Laughter) 
 Articles about water, ads about water.,Imagine what the worldnwas like 40 years ago,,with just the Saturday Evening Postnand Time and Newsweek.,Now there are magazines about water.,New product from Coke Japan: water salad. 
 (Laughter) 
 Coke Japan comes outnwith a new product every three weeks,,because they have no ideanwhat's going to work and what's not.,I couldn't have writtennthis better myself.,It came out four days ago --,I circled the important partsnso you can see them here.,They've come out...,Arby's is going to spendn85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt,with the voice of Tom Arnold,,hoping that that will get people to gonto Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I had tried to imagine what couldnpossibly be in an animated TV commercial,featuring Tom Arnold,nthat would get you to get in your car,,drive across townnand buy a roast beef sandwich. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right,,when he was talking to anyonenwho needs to hear your idea.,"The world revolves around me.",Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.,I don't want to get emailnfrom anybody; I want to get "memail." 
 (Laughter) 
 So consumers, and I don't just meannpeople who buy stuff at the Safeway;,I mean people at the Defense Departmentnwho might buy something,,or people at, you know, the New Yorkernwho might print your article.,Consumers don't care about younat all; they just don't care.,Part of the reason is -- they've gotnway more choices than they used to,,and way less time.,And in a world where we haventoo many choices and too little time,,the obvious thing to donis just ignore stuff.,And my parable herenis you're driving down the road,and you see a cow, and you keep drivingnbecause you've seen cows before.,Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.,Who's going to stop and pull overnand say -- "Oh, look, a cow.",Nobody. 
 (Laughter) 
 But if the cow was purple --nisn't that a great special effect?,I could do that again if you want.,If the cow was purple,nyou'd notice it for a while.,I mean, if all cows were purplenyou'd get bored with those, too.,The thing that's going to decidenwhat gets talked about,,what gets done, what gets changed,,what gets purchased, what gets built,,is: "Is it remarkable?",And "remarkable" is a really cool word,,because we think it just means "neat,",but it also meansn"worth making a remark about.",And that is the essencenof where idea diffusion is going.,That two of the hottest carsnin the United States,is a 55,000-dollar giant car,,big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.,People are paying full price for both,,and the only thing they have in common,is that they don't havenanything in common. 
 (Laughter) 
 Every week, the number onenbest-selling DVD in America changes.,It's never "The Godfather,"nit's never "Citizen Kane,",it's always some third-rate movienwith some second-rate star.,But the reason it's number onenis because that's the week it came out.,Because it's new, because it's fresh.,People saw it and saidn"I didn't know that was there",and they noticed it.,Two of the big success storiesnof the last 20 years in retail --,one sells things that arensuper-expensive in a blue box,,and one sells things that arenas cheap as they can make them.,The only thing they have in commonnis that they're different. 
 We're now in the fashion business,nno matter what we do for a living,,we're in the fashion business.,And people in the fashion business,know what it's like to be in the fashionnbusiness -- they're used to it.,The rest of us have to figure outnhow to think that way.,How to understand,that it's not about interruptingnpeople with big full-page ads,,or insisting on meetings with people.,But it's a totally differentnsort of process,that determines which ideas spread,nand which ones don't.,They sold a billion dollars'nworth of Aeron chairs,by reinventingnwhat it meant to sell a chair.,They turned a chair from somethingnthe purchasing department bought,,to something that was a status symbolnabout where you sat at work.,This guy, Lionel Poilâne,nthe most famous baker in the world --,he died two and a half months ago,,and he was a hero of minenand a dear friend.,He lived in Paris.,Last year, he sold 10 million dollars'nworth of French bread.,Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,,by one baker at a time,nin a wood-fired oven.,And when Lionel started his bakery,nthe French pooh-pooh-ed it.,They didn't want to buy his bread.,It didn't look like "French bread.",It wasn't what they expected.,It was neat; it was remarkable;,and slowly, it spreadnfrom one person to another person,until finally, it became the officialnbread of three-star restaurants in Paris.,Now he's in London, and he shipsnby FedEx all around the world. 
 What marketers used to do is makenaverage products for average people.,That's what mass marketing is.,Smooth out the edges; go for the center;nthat's the big market.,They would ignore the geeks,nand God forbid, the laggards.,It was all about going for the center.,But in a world wherenthe TV-industrial complex is broken,,I don't think that's a strategynwe want to use any more.,I think the strategy we want to usenis to not market to these people,because they're really goodnat ignoring you.,But market to thesenpeople because they care.,These are the peoplenwho are obsessed with something.,And when you talk to them, they'll listen,,because they like listening --nit's about them.,And if you're lucky, they'll tellntheir friends on the rest of the curve,,and it'll spread.,It'll spread to the entire curve. 
 They have something I call "otaku" --nit's a great Japanese word.,It describes the desirenof someone who's obsessed to say,,drive across Tokyo to tryna new ramen noodle place,,because that's what they do:nthey get obsessed with it.,To make a product, to market an idea,,to come up with any problemnyou want to solve,that doesn't havena constituency with an otaku,,is almost impossible.,Instead, you have to findna group that really, desperately cares,about what it is you have to say.,Talk to them and make it easynfor them to tell their friends.,There's a hot sauce otaku,nbut there's no mustard otaku.,That's why there's lots and lotsnof kinds of hot sauces,,and not so many kinds of mustard.,Not because it's hardnto make interesting mustard --,you could make interesting mustard --,but people don't,nbecause no one's obsessed with it,,and thus no one tells their friends.,Krispy Kreme has figurednthis whole thing out.,It has a strategy, and what they do is,,they enter a city, they talknto the people, with the otaku,,and then they spread through the city,to the people who've justncrossed the street. 
 This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars,nbut it sleeps for 12 minutes.,Not everybody wants itnbut they don't care.,They want to talk to the peoplenwho do, and maybe it'll spread.,These guys make the loudestncar stereo in the world. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's as loud as a 747 jet. 
 You can't get in,nthe car's got bulletproof glass,,because it'll blow outnthe windshield otherwise.,But the fact remains,that when someone wants to putna couple of speakers in their car,,if they've got the otakunor they've heard from someone who does,,they go ahead and they pick this. 
 It's really simple -- you sellnto the people who are listening,,and just maybe,nthose people tell their friends.,So when Steve Jobs talksnto 50,000 people at his keynote,,who are all tuned in from 130 countries,watching his two-hour commercial --,that's the only thing keepingnhis company in business --,it's that those 50,000 peoplencare desperately enough,to watch a two-hour commercial,nand then tell their friends.,Pearl Jam, 96 albums releasednin the last two years.,Every one made a profit. How?,They only sell them on their website.,Those people who buy them have the otaku,,and then they tell their friends,nand it spreads and it spreads.,This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars,n10 times the standard.,But hospitals are buying itnfaster than any other model.,Hard Candy nail polish,ndoesn't appeal to everybody,,but to the people who love it,nthey talk about it like crazy.,This paint can right here savednthe Dutch Boy paint company,,making them a fortune.,It costs 35 percent morenthan regular paint,because Dutch Boy made a can that peoplentalk about, because it's remarkable.,They didn't just slapna new ad on the product;,they changed what it meantnto build a paint product.,AmIhotornot.com -- everydayn250,000 people go to this site,,run by two volunteers, and I canntell you they are hard graders -- 
 (Laughter) 
 They didn't get this waynby advertising a lot.,They got this way by being remarkable,,sometimes a little too remarkable.,And this picture framenhas a cord going out the back,,and you plug it into the wall.,My father has this on his desk,,and he sees his grandchildrenneveryday, changing constantly.,And every single personnwho walks into his office,hears the whole storynof how this thing ended up on his desk.,And one person at a time,nthe idea spreads.,These are not diamonds, not really.,They're made from "cremains.",After you're cremated you cannhave yourself made into a gem. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother. 
 (Laughter) 
 Fastest-growing businessnin the whole mortuary industry.,But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne --,you don't have to bensuper-outrageous to do this.,What you have to do,is figure out what peoplenreally want and give it to them. 
 A couple of quick rules to wrap up.,The first one is: Designnis free when you get to scale.,The people who come upnwith stuff that's remarkable,more often than not figure outnhow to put design to work for them.,Number two: The riskiest thingnyou can do now is be safe.,Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?,The whole model of beingnProctor and Gamble,is always about average productsnfor average people.,That's risky.,The safe thing to do nownis to be at the fringes,,be remarkable.,And being very good is onenof the worst things you can possibly do.,Very good is boring. Very good is average.,It doesn't matter whethernyou're making a record album,,or you're an architect,nor you have a tract on sociology.,If it's very good, it's not going to work,nbecause no one's going to notice it. 
 So my three stories.,Silk put a product that does not neednto be in the refrigerated section,next to the milknin the refrigerated section.,Sales tripled. Why?,Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.,For the people who were therenand looking at that section,,it was remarkable.,They didn't triple their salesnwith advertising;,they tripled it by doingnsomething remarkable.,That is a remarkable piece of art.,You don't have to like it,,but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushesnin the middle of New York City,is remarkable. 
 (Laughter) 
 Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum;,he changed an entire city's economy,by designing one building that peoplenfrom all over the world went to see.,Now, at countless meetings at, you know,,the Portland City Council,nor who knows where,,they said, we need an architect --ncan we get Frank Gehry?,Because he did somethingnthat was at the fringes.,And my big failure?nI came out with an entire -- 
 (Music) 
 A record album and hopefullyna whole bunch of record albums,in SACD, this remarkable new format --,and I marketed it straight to peoplenwith 20,000-dollar stereos.,People with 20,000-dollar stereosndon't like new music. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what you need to donis figure out who does care.,Who is going to raise their hand and say,,"I want to hear what you're doing next,",and sell something to them.,The last example I want to give you.,This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.,As you can see, if that's nowhere,nit's in the middle of it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they do have a lake.,And people used to come from milesnaround to swim in the lake.,They don't anymore.,So the founding fathers said,n"We've got some money to spend.,What can we build here?",And like most committees,,they were going to buildnsomething pretty safe.,And then an artist came to them --nthis is a true artist's rendering --,he wants to build a 55-foot tallnlava lamp in the center of town.,That's a purple cow;nthat's something worth noticing.,I don't know about you,,but if they build it,nthat's where I'm going to go. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.This is a sculpture I made,,which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form,into an object that has different degrees of freedom.,So, it can balance on a point.,This is a bronze ball,,an aluminum arm here,,and then this wooden disk.,And the wooden disk was really thought about,as something that you'd want to hold on to,,and that would glide easily through your hands.,The aluminum is because it's very light.,The bronze is nice hard, durable material,that could roll on the ground.,Inside of the bronze ball,there's a lead weight,that is free-swinging on an axle,that's on two bearings,that pass in between, across it,,like this, that counterbalance this weight.,So it allows it to roll.,And the sphere has that balance property,that it always sort of stays still,and looks the same from every direction.,But if you put something on top of it,,it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.,But in this case because,the interior is free-swinging,in relation to the sphere,,it can stand up on one point.,And then there was a second level to this object,,which is that it --,I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,,which is the diameter of the Moon,and the diameter of the Earth,in proportion to each other. 
 I was exploring, really early on,,wanting to make things float in the air.,And I thought up a lot of ideas.,This is sculpture that I made that --,it's magnetically levitated.,The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.,Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.,But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit,without, um -- oops.,So this is just floating,,floating on a permanent magnetic field,,which stabilizes it in all directions.,Except there is a slight tether here,,which keeps it from going over the top of its field.,It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field,at the crest of a wave.,And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable. 
 I think we could roll the tape, admin.,I have a sort of a collection of videos,that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.,This is a sculpture of the Sun,and the Earth, in proportion.,Representing that eight and a half minutes,that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.,So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter,that was turned of solid bronze. 
 And here is a similar sculpture.,That's the Sun at that end.,And then in a series of 55 balls,,it reduces, proportionately -- each ball,and the spaces between them,reduce proportionately,,until they get down to this little Earth.,This is in a sculpture park in Taejon. 
 This one is about the Moon,and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.,This is a little stone ball, floating.,As you can see the little tether,,that it's also magnetically levitated. 
 And then this is the first part of --,this is 109 spheres,,since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.,And so this is the size of the Sun.,And then each of these little spheres,is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.,It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.,This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.,I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter) 
 So this, again, is on the subject --,a slice from the equator of the Earth.,And then the Moon in the center,,and it's floating. And this is in France. 
 This is in Sapporo.,It's balancing on a shaft and a ball,,right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,,which means that the lower half of the object,is just a little bit more weighty.,So you can see it rotating here.,It weighs about a ton or over a ton.,It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.,But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.,It's susceptible to motion by the air currents. 
 This is another species of work that I do.,These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,,but they have magnets horizontally in them,that make them all like compasses.,So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.,And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.,So as you turn around you're seeing different colors. 
 This is based on the structure of a diamond.,It was a diamond cell structure,was the point of departure.,And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows,between the atoms.,And so I placed one more element of each one of them.,These were white spheres.,Then I had video projectors,that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.,So they would catch parts of the images,,and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,,as you walk through it, through the object. 
 This is something I did,of a tactile communication system.,It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,,and then putting it into a communication system.,This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,,that would be directed around the room,by a computer. 
 This is a clock I designed.,It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.,It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth. 
 And then, this is like,projects that are harder to build.,(Laughter),This has a diamond-bottomed lake.,So it's a floating island,with water, fresh water,,that can fly from place to place.,This would be grown, I suppose,,with nanotechnology in the future sometime. 
 In the course of doing my work,I sort of have a broad range of interests.,And some of it is just the idea of creating media --,media as a sculpture,,something that would keep the sculpture,fresh and ever-changing,,by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.,And I had a lot of --,always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.,And the idea that you could see things,inside of a crystal ball and predict the future --,or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box,where anything can appear.,I had thought about, a long time ago,,in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out,,I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's,grand project for an electric globe,across from the United Nations --,and other things that were happening,,the space program at that time,,and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.,I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets,that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites. 
 So if we could roll the next film here.,This has evolved over the years,in a lot of different iterations.,But this the current version of it,,is a flying airship,that is about 35 meters in diameter,,about 110 feet in diameter.,The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,,red, blue, and green,,that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight. 
 I came with a plan.,I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment,to do a feasibility study,,and they analyzed it,,and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.,So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.,This is the control room inside of the ship.,The idea of this air genie is,,it's something that can just transform and become anything.,It's like a traveling show.,It has speakers on it. And it has cameras,over the surface of it.,So it can see its environment,,and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.,Here the legs are retracting.,The cabin is open or closed, as you like.,It weighs about 20 tons.,It has on-board generators.,It can generate about a million kilowatts,,in order to be bright enough,to be visible in daylight.,The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.,It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.,There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,,that would allow the thing to become,actually kind of a conscious object,that would respond to the moment,,and to interact as an entity,that was aware, that could communicate.,It's completely silent and nonpolluting.,It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.,It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways. 
 Primarily I would be interested in,how it would interact with, say,,going to a college campus,,and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,,the world, the situation of the globe.,The default image on the object,would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.,But then one could interact with that,and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations --,all of the things that we're concerned with today. 
 And then at night the idea is that,it would be used as kind of a rave situation,,where the people could cut loose,,and the music and the lights, and everything.,So it could land in a park, for example.,Or this could represent a college green.,And then it would have a corresponding website,that would show the itinerary of this.,And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.,It would also be able to be an open code,,so people could interact with it.,It would be forum for people's ideas about,what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.,So that's pretty much it.,Okay. Thank you.,(Applause)I was asked to come here and speak about creation.,And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.,And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,,which I call "creativity.",Creativity is how we cope with creation.,While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,,creativity is always meaningful.,See, for instance, in this picture.,You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,,and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters. 
 When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.,You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.,I just did things.,Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was,,and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.,It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly --,looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties --,they followed a straight line that brings me to the point,that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.,Though it's actually true, you know,,the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.,If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil. 
 You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s,under a climate of political distress,,and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way --,in a sort of a semiotic black market.,You couldn't really say what you wanted to say;,you had to invent ways of doing it.,You didn't trust information very much.,That led me to another step of why I'm here today,,is because I really liked media of all kinds.,I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.,My first job in Brazil,was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,,and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.,It was very -- actually, it was a very good study,,and got me a job in an ad agency.,And they also decided that I had to --,to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it. 
 And another point -- why I'm here --,is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,,I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,,picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.,On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.,Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.,They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.,And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) --,and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,,the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun --,I don't know why he had a gun --,and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.,The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.,Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.,And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry,and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.,And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,,and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:,because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.,You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.,Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do --,I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,,that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter),But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know,,they would only let me do other things.,But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.,The first works were actually objects.,It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.,And I called them relics.,They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983. 
 This is the clown skull.,Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.,They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter),This is the Ashanti joystick.,Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.,A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.,The rocking podium. (Laughter),This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter),Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,,that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;,the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.,The Bonsai table.,The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.,And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet. 
 I wanted to take that into the realm of images,,and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.,So I decided to do work with clouds.,Because clouds can mean anything you want.,But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,,so something that would mean at the same time,a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands --,although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.,But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.,They're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.,"The Snail.",But I was still working with sculpture,,and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.,"The Teapot." 
 I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94,,and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise.",And he did something that was very tricky.,He put together two different media from different periods of time.,First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,,and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.,And it's totally overkill.,And your eye doesn't know which level to read.,And you become trapped into this kind of representation.,So I decided to make these very simple renderings,,that at first they are taken as a line drawing --,you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.,The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?,And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing.",Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.,It had a physicality,,and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative,that goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica.","Relaxation.","Fiat Lux." 
 And the same way the history of representation,evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.,And I wanted to deal with other subjects.,I started taking that into the realm of landscape,,which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.,I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,",and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.,These always end up being a photograph at the end,,or more like an etching in this case.,So this is a lighthouse.,This is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.,And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable. 
 Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,,like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.,I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,,and I did work and play with them.,I got some photographs from them.,Upon my arrival in New York, I decided --,they were children of sugar plantation workers.,And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.,These are -- (Applause) --,Thank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest.",It was just the name of the child,,with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.,"Valicia.","Jacynthe." 
 But another layer of representation was still introduced.,Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures,,I realized that I could add still another thing,I was trying to make a subject --,something that would interfere with the themes,,so chocolate is very good, because it has --,it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.,And so I decided to make these pictures,,and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.,So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate.",Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.,And Jackson Pollock also. 
 Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting,,because, you know, you go to that --,you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,,like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.,"Paparazzi.",I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.,And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.,And you render this with the most non-specific material,,which is dust itself.,Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.,They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.,This is Richard Serra. 
 I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.,You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?,And I realized that I never worked with color,,because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.,But once they're applied to numeric structure,,then you can feel more comfortable.,So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.,They end up being very large pictures,,and I photographed with a very large camera --,an 8x10 camera.,So you can see the surface of every single swatch --,like in this picture of Chuck Close.,And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.,Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --,and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,,which is the bit map.,I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks." 
 This is something I used to do as a joke --,you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" --,and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.,I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.,But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship,between the model and the original.,And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.,I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking. 
 And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,,being 150 meters away.,Now I would do very small ones, which would be like --,but under the same light, and I would show them together,,so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.,I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.,I was more interested in the things in between,,you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.,This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.,This is a pipe.,A hanger. 
 And this is another thing that I did -- you know working,-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,,but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --,a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.,And I love this work,,because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.,And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,,that's justified on this thing.,In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,,trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.,And in this, you'd have like a --,something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.,So they're like perfect actors. 
 My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.,Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars,to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,",and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,,he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.,On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --,and I went to a warehouse in Queens,to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.,And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --,his name was Joey Grimaldi --,he impersonated the Moorish general,-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,,and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --,plumber, general, plumber, general --,so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one. 
 See, I think it's not really about impression,,making people fall for a really perfect illusion,,as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.,Because it's not about fooling somebody,,it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:,how much you want to be fooled.,That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.,Well, I think that's it.,My time is nearly up.,Thank you very much.I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,,in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,,such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,,the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe,and so on. And within the last decade or two,,archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems,underlying many of these past collapses.,But there were also plenty of places in the world,where societies have been developing for thousands of years,without any sign of a major collapse,,such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies,in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.,How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile,than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant,to our situation today, because today as well, there are,some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia,and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also,societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia. 
 What about ourselves?,What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid,declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?,Obviously the answer to this question is not going,to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor,explanation for societal collapses, you know right away,that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.,But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?,In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a,five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through,to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point,framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.,This is a European society with literate records,,so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.,In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,,and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,,and every one of them ended up dead. 
 Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,,the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts,on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource,base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,,the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,,which was a particular problem for them because,they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.,So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually,unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is,climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.,In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder,in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate,isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting,Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,,with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well? 
 The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring,friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that,friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society,more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,,they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --,and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,,partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway. 
 The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.,In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --,the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse,got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit,killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,,may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which,the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year. 
 And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,,economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it,more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its,environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,,cultural factors that made it difficult for them,to solve their problems were: their commitments to a,Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being,a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,,from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part,framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse. 
 What about a society today?,For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to,Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager,on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems,like the most pristine environment in the United States.,But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.,Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?,Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste,have caused damage of billions of dollars.,Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly,200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas,from salinization, problems of forest management,,problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:,climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer,and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation,from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,,as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --,that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture. 
 Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies,that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of,the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,,but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from,social security, investments and so on --,which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States. 
 Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems,as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems,created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,,and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:,question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes,play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today,seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.,Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,,and to no government regulation; values that worked well,in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today. 
 So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses,for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.,Are there any general conclusions that arise?,In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage,being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --,they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain,common threads that emerge from these comparisons,of past societies that did or did not collapse,and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread,has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse,after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies,that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer,and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades,after their peak, they collapse. For example,,the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the,early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building,their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest. 
 Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place,within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time,when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.,An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.,These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's,a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,,or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.,In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,,and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,,and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation,half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still,being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.,So, this is a frequent theme:,societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power. 
 What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned,about a society today, you should be looking not at the value,of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should,be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives,of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme,is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make,some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors,are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,,of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as,the most devastating case of complete deforestation?,It turns out that there were about nine different environmental,factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against,the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,,latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them,is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients,which protects island environments in the Pacific is from,the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.,Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust,from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's,a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999. 
 So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,,are more fragile than others. And then finally,,another generalization. I'm now teaching a course,at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses,of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,,how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?,How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?,What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?,Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies,not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?,And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,,then maybe in the next century people will be asking,,why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see,the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?,It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem,incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been,trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations,about why societies fail to solve their problems --,why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,,why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,,why do they fail to succeed in solving them? 
 I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.,One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,,is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term,interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term,interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites,are able to insulate themselves from the consequences,of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite,is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite,doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.,For example, among the Greenland Norse --,a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted,is more followers and more sheep and more resources,to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs,to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,,forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made,the chiefs powerful in the short run,,but led to the society's collapse in the long run. 
 Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute,in the United States today. Especially because,the decision makers in the United States are frequently,able to insulate themselves from consequences,by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water,and so on. And within the last couple of years,,it's been obvious that the elite in the business world,correctly perceive that they can advance,their short-term interest by doing things that are,good for them but bad for society as a whole,,such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron,and other businesses. They are quite correct,that these things are good for them in the short term,,although bad for society in the long term.,So, that's one general conclusion about why societies,make bad decisions: conflicts of interest. 
 And the other generalization that I want to mention,is that it's particularly hard for a society to make,quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving,strongly held values that are good in many circumstances,but are poor in other circumstances. For example,,the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,,were held together for four-and-a-half centuries,by their shared commitment to religion,,and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --,commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --,also made it difficult for them to change at the end,and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.,One of the things that enabled Australia to survive,in this remote outpost of European civilization,for 250 years has been their British identity.,But today, their commitment to a British identity,is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt,to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult,to change course when the things that get you in trouble,are the things that are also the source of your strength. 
 What's going to be the outcome today?,Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs,going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses,of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,,and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,,of soil, of climate change, invasive species,,the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --,listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --,none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them,have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,,have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,,the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest,within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only,one year away from losing their loggable forest,,which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular,for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,,Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do,about the world's environmental problems?,And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do,is to forget about there being any single thing that is,the most important thing we need to do.,Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.,And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,,we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,,if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,,but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble. 
 The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,,which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.,And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.,That means that those of us in this room who are less than,50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,,and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see,the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.,The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:,either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses,in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,,or else these conflicts are going to get settled,in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,,disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our,non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another,in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session,is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should,get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion. 
 The big problems facing the world today are not at all,things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid,about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.,Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems,entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,,we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's,entirely in our power to deal with these problems.,In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you,who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things,you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,,and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that,we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that,we need to be doing. Thank you.,(Applause)When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,,it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population,is HIV positive.,It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people,that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.,For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.,When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.,He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,,and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.,He liked to sit on her lap,because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.,When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap,and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.,Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.,I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,,and he asked me for slippers,,because he said that his feet were cold. 
 This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.,Single mother, HIV positive.,I photographed her before and after,the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.,And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan,and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,,but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away,at the age of 23.,Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,,like so many other Zimbabwean children,who've been orphaned by the epidemic.,So a few of the stories.,With every picture,,there are individuals who have full lives,and stories that deserve to be told.,All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. 
 Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,,just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa? 
 Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh. 
 CA: Just -- 
 KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production,for a fashion photographer.,And I was constantly reading the New York Times,,and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.,It was just frightening.,So I quit my job,and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.,And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --,this is in December 2000 --,then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,,and then went back again this March 2002,for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. 
 CA: That's an amazing story, thank you. 
 KB: Thanks for letting me show these.A year ago, I spoke to you about a book,that I was just in the process of completing,,that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today,about some of the controversies that that book inspired.,The book is called "The Blank Slate,",based on the popular idea,that the human mind is a blank slate,,and that all of its structure comes from,socialization, culture, parenting, experience.,The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.,Here are a few quotes indicating that:,"Man has no nature," from the historian,Jose Ortega y Gasset;,"Man has no instincts," from the,anthropologist Ashley Montagu;,"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors,and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. 
 There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind,is a blank slate,,and some of them just come from common sense.,As many people have told me over the years,,anyone who's had more than one child,knows that kids come into the world,with certain temperaments and talents;,it doesn't all come from the outside.,Oh, and anyone who,has both a child and a house pet,has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,,will acquire a human language,,whereas the house pet won't,,presumably because of some innate different between them.,And anyone who's ever been,in a heterosexual relationship knows that,the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.,There are also, I think,,increasing results from,the scientific study of humans,that, indeed, we're not born blank slates.,One of them, from anthropology,,is the study of human universals.,If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --,kind of an occupational,pleasure of anthropologists to show,how exotic other cultures can be,,and that there are places out there where, supposedly,,everything is the opposite to the way it is here.,But if you instead,look at what is common to the world's cultures,,you find that there is an enormously rich set,of behaviors and emotions,and ways of construing the world,that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.,The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,,and they range from aesthetics,,affection and age statuses,all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,,attempts to control, the color white,and a worldview. 
 Also, genetics and neuroscience,are increasingly showing that the brain,is intricately structured.,This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson,and his colleagues in which they --,using MRI --,measured the distribution of gray matter --,that is, the outer layer of the cortex --,in a large sample of pairs of people.,They coded correlations in the thickness,of gray matter in different parts of the brain,using a false color scheme, in which,no difference is coded as purple,,and any color other than purple indicates,a statistically significant correlation.,Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.,By definition, two people picked at random,can't have correlations in the distribution,of gray matter in the cortex.,This is what happens in people who share,half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.,And as you can see, large amounts of the brain,are not purple, showing that if one person,has a thicker bit of cortex,in that region, so does his fraternal twin.,And here's what happens if you,get a pair of people who share all their DNA --,namely, clones or identical twins.,And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are,massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter. 
 Now, these aren't just,differences in anatomy,,like the shape of your ear lobes,,but they have consequences in thought and behavior,that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:,"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.",As you can see, there are two inventors,with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting,in the waiting room of a patent attorney.,Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because,studies of identical twins who were separated at birth,and then tested in adulthood,show that they have astonishing similarities.,And this happens in every pair of identical twins,separated at birth ever studied --,but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.,My favorite example is a pair of twins,,one of whom was brought up,as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,,the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.,When they walked into the lab in Minnesota,,they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;,both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,,both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,,both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,,and both of them liked to surprise people,by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.,Now --,the story might seem to good to be true,,but when you administer,batteries of psychological tests,,you get the same results -- namely,,identical twins separated at birth show,quite astonishing similarities. 
 Now, given both the common sense,and scientific data,calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,,why should it have been such an appealing notion?,Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.,The foremost is that if we're blank slates,,then, by definition, we are equal,,because zero equals zero equals zero.,But if something is written on the slate,,then some people could have more of it than others,,and according to this line of thinking, that would justify,discrimination and inequality. 
 Another political fear of human nature,is that if we are blank slates,,we can perfect mankind --,the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species,through social engineering.,Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts,,then perhaps some of them might condemn us,to selfishness, prejudice and violence.,Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.,And just to make a long story short:,first of all, the concept of fairness,is not the same as the concept of sameness.,And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote,in the Declaration of Independence,,"We hold these truths to be self-evident,,that all men are created equal,",he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,,that all men are clones.",Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,,and that every person ought to be treated,as an individual, and not prejudged,by the statistics of particular groups,that they may belong to.,Also, even if we were born,with certain ignoble motives,,they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.,That is because the human mind,is a complex system with many parts,,and some of them can inhibit others.,For example, there's excellent reason to believe,that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,,and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us,to profit from the lessons of history.,So even if people did have impulses,towards selfishness or greed,,that's not the only thing in the skull,,and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them. 
 In the book, I,go over controversies such as this one,,and a number of other hot buttons,,hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --,including the arts, cloning, crime,,free will, education, evolution,,gender differences, God, homosexuality,,infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,,Nazism, parenting, politics,,race, rape, religion, resource depletion,,social engineering, technological risk and war.,And needless to say, there were certain risks,in taking on these subjects.,When I wrote a first draft of the book,,I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,,and here are some of,the reactions that I got:,"Better get a security camera for your house.","Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers,or positions in scholarly societies.","Tell your publisher not to list your hometown,in your author bio.","Do you have tenure?",(Laughter) 
 Well, the book came out in October,,and nothing terrible has happened.,I -- I like --,There was indeed reason to be nervous,,and there were moments in which I did feel nervous,,knowing the history,of what has happened to people,who've taken controversial stands,or discovered disquieting findings,in the behavioral sciences.,There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,,of people who have been slandered, called Nazis,,physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution,for stumbling across or arguing,about controversial findings.,And you never know when you're going to,come across one of these booby traps.,My favorite example is a pair of psychologists,who did research on left-handers,,and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,,more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents,and have a shorter lifespan.,It's not clear, by the way, since then,,whether that is an accurate generalization,,but the data at the time seemed to support that.,Well, pretty soon they were barraged,with enraged letters,,death threats,,ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,,coming from irate left-handers,and their advocates,,and they were literally afraid to open their mail,because of the venom and vituperation,that they had inadvertently inspired. 
 Well,,the night is young, but the book has been out,for half a year,,and nothing terrible has happened.,None of the dire professional consequences,has taken place --,I haven't been,exiled from the city of Cambridge.,But what I wanted to talk about,are two of these hot buttons,that have aroused the strongest response,in the 80-odd reviews,that The Blank Slate has received.,I'll just put that list up for a few seconds,,and see if you can guess which two,-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics,inspired probably 90 percent,of the reaction in the various reviews,and radio interviews.,It's not violence and war,,it's not race, it's not gender,,it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.,They are: the arts and parenting.,(Laughter),So let me tell you what,aroused such irate responses,,and I'll let you decide if whether they --,the claims are really that outrageous. 
 Let me start with the arts.,I note that among the long list of human universals,that I presented a few slides ago,are art.,There is no society ever discovered,in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something,that we would consider the arts.,Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --,appears to be a human universal.,The telling of stories, music,,dance, poetry -- found in all cultures,,and many of the motifs and themes,that,give us pleasure in the arts,can be found in all human societies:,a preference for symmetrical forms,,the use of repetition and variation,,even things as specific as the fact,that in poetry all over the world,,you have lines that are very close,to three seconds long, separated by pauses.,Now, on the other hand,,in the second half of the 20th century,,the arts are frequently said to be in decline.,And I have a collection,,probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines,deploring the fact that,the arts are in decline in our time.,I'll give you a couple of representative quotes:,"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is,one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower,than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline,are visible in every department of human activity.",That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.,And a more recent one:,"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time,is becoming increasing problematical.,Serious book stores are losing their franchise,,nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily,by commercializing their repertory,,symphony orchestras are diluting their programs,,public television is increasing its dependence,on reruns of British sitcoms,,classical radio stations are dwindling,,museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying.",That's from Robert Brustein,,the famous drama critic and director,,in The New Republic about five years ago. 
 Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline.,I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,,but by any standard,they have never been flourishing,to a greater extent.,There are, of course, entirely new art forms,and new media, many of which you've heard,over these few days.,By any economic standard,,the demand for art of all forms,is skyrocketing,,as you can tell from the price of opera tickets,,by the number of books sold,,by the number of books published,,the number of musical titles released,,the number of new albums and so on.,The only grain of truth to this,complaint that the arts are in decline,come from three spheres.,One of them is in elite art since the 1930s --,say, the kinds of works performed,by major symphony orchestras,,where most of the repertory is before 1930,,or the works shown in,major galleries and prestigious museums.,In literary criticism and analysis,,probably 40 or 50 years ago,,literary critics were a kind of cultural hero;,now they're kind of a national joke.,And the humanities and arts programs,in the universities, which by many measures,,indeed are in decline.,Students are staying away in droves,,universities are disinvesting,in the arts and humanities. 
 Well, here's a diagnosis.,They didn't ask me, but by their own admission,,they need all the help that they can get.,And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence,that this supposed decline,in the elite arts and criticism,occurred in the same point in history in which,there was a widespread denial of human nature.,A famous quotation can be found --,if you look on the web, you can find it in,literally scores,of English core syllabuses --,"In or about December 1910,,human nature changed.",A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,,and there's some debate,as to what she actually meant by that.,But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,,that -- it's used now,as a way of saying that all forms,of appreciation of art,that were in place for centuries, or millennia,,in the 20th century were discarded.,The beauty and pleasure in art --,probably a human universal --,were -- began to be considered saccharine,,or kitsch, or commercial.,Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art,is the desire to destroy beauty" --,which was considered bourgeois or tacky.,And here's just one example.,I mean, this is perhaps a representative example,of the visual depiction of the female form,in the 15th century;,here is a representative example,of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.,And, as you can see, there -- something has changed,in the way the elite arts,appeal to the senses. 
 Indeed, in movements of modernism,and post-modernism,,there was visual art without beauty,,literature without narrative and plot,,poetry without meter and rhyme,,architecture and planning without ornament,,human scale, green space and natural light,,music without melody and rhythm,,and criticism without clarity,,attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.,(Laughter),Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement.,But here, there -- one of the most famous literary,English scholars of our time,is the Berkeley professor,,Judith Butler.,And here is an example of,one of her analyses:,"The move from a structuralist account in which capital,is understood to structure social relations,in relatively homologous ways,to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,,convergence and rearticulation,brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,,and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory,that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...",Well, you get the idea.,By the way, this is one sentence --,you can actually parse it.,Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate",was that elite art and criticism,in the 20th century,,although not the arts in general,,have disdained beauty, pleasure,,clarity, insight and style.,People are staying away from elite art and criticism.,What a puzzle -- I wonder why.,Well, this turned out to be probably,the most controversial claim in the book.,Someone asked me whether I stuck it in,in order to deflect ire,from discussions of gender and Nazism,and race and so on. I won't comment on that.,But it certainly inspired,an energetic reaction,from many university professors. 
 Well, the other hot button is parenting.,And the starting point is the -- for that discussion,was the fact that we have all,been subject to the advice,of the parenting industrial complex.,Now, here is -- here is a,representative quote from a besieged mother:,"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.,I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids,so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit,so they'll grow up to be healthy adults.,And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play,so they'll grow up smart.,And there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,,word games for reading success, large motor play,,small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life,to figuring out what to play with my kids.",I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize,with this mother. 
 Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting.,Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based,are useless. They're useless because they don't control,for heritability. They measure some correlation,between what the parents do, how the children turn out,and assume a causal relation:,that the parenting shaped the child.,Parents who talk a lot to their kids,have kids who grow up to be articulate,,parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up,to be violent and so on.,And very few of them control for the possibility,that parents pass on genes for --,that increase the chances a child will be articulate,or violent and so on.,Until the studies are redone with adoptive children,,who provide an environment,but not genes to their kids,,we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. 
 The genetically controlled studies,have some sobering results.,Remember the Mallifert twins:,separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --,remarkably similar.,Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?,You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,,because not only would they share their genes,,but they would also share their environment.,That would make them super-similar, right?,Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,,who are separated at birth are no less similar,than if they had grown up together.,Everything that happens to you in a given home,over all of those years,appears to leave no permanent stamp,on your personality or intellect.,A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,,is that adopted siblings reared together --,the mirror image of identical twins reared apart,,they share their parents, their home,,their neighborhood,,don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.,OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding. 
 What it suggests is that children are shaped,not by their parents over the long run,,but in part -- only in part -- by their genes,,in part by their culture --,the culture of the country at large,and the children's own culture, namely their peer group --,as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,,that's what kids care about --,and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,,by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;,chance events as you live your life. 
 So let me conclude,with just a remark,to bring it back to the theme of choices.,I think that the sciences of human nature --,behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology,,neuroscience, cognitive science --,are going to, increasingly in the years to come,,upset various dogmas,,careers and deeply-held political belief systems.,And that presents us with a choice.,The choice is whether certain facts about humans,,or topics, are to be considered taboos,,forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there,because no good can come from it,,or whether we should explore them honestly.,I have my own,answer to that question,,which comes from a great artist of the 19th century,,Anton Chekhov, who said,,"Man will become better when you show him,what he is like.",And I think that the argument,can't be put any more eloquently than that.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,,which was this very implausible technology,that technically could have worked,,but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.,So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.,This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.,This was a perfect introduction.,And it's a story that did work. It did happen,,and the machines are all around us.,And it was a technology that was inevitable.,If the people I'm going to tell you the story about,,if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.,So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time. 
 This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.,It's the universe in which these machines,are now doing all these things, including changing biology.,I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,,which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:,it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.,And three of the smartest people were,Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.,And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,,he was working on something much more important than bombs:,he's thinking about computers.,So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built. 
 (Laughter) 
 He built this machine,,and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,,with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.,The first person to really explain that,was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,,explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,,and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,,you can do it all with arithmetic.,He said you needed addition and subtraction.,Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 --,showed that you didn't even need subtraction.,You could do the whole thing with addition.,Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic,that drove the computer revolution.,And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.,He talked about doing it with marbles,,having gates and what we now call shift registers,,where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.,And that's what all these machines are doing,,except, instead of doing it with marbles,,they're doing it with electrons. 
 And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,,when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.,And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed,to actually try and build such a machine.,So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet --,and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,,which also goes back to Turing,,who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this,with a very brainless, little, finite state machine,,just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.,The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did,was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.,Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,,giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.,Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,,but capable of only two ideas. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's really the simplest computer.,It's basically why you need the qubit,,because it only has two ideas. 
 And you put lots of those together,,you get the essentials of the modern computer:,the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,,the recording medium, the input and the output.,But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know,,we saw it in starting these programs up.,The instructions which govern this operation,must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.,So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work. 
 If you look at the origins of this,,the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.,But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,,the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,,really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,,and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.,Such a computer would open up universes,,which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.,So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.,The guy who was supposed to build this machine,was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.,RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions,of all time, decided not to go into computers.,But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.,RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,,televisions are the future, not computers. 
 The essentials were all there --,all the things that make these machines run.,Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army,put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.,When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,,where Freeman works at the Institute.,That's where I grew up as a kid.,That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,,so we both go back to the birth of this thing.,That's Freeman, a long time ago,,and that was me.,And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,,who wrote the "Theory of Games.",All these forces came together there, in Princeton.,Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.,The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.,And Julian Bigelow, who took,Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,,how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,,and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.,These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.,They didn't fit in at the Institute.,This is a letter from the director, concerned about --,"especially unfair on the matter of sugar." 
 (Laughter) 
 You can read the text. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time. 
 (Laughter). 
 These were not theoretical physicists.,They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing. 
 And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines,has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.,They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques,to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.,They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,,because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.,And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.,Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned,at 15 other places around the world.,And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.,All the computers now are copies of that machine.,The memory was in cathode ray tubes --,a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube --,very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.,So, there's 40 of these tubes,,like a V-40 engine running the memory. 
 (Laughter) 
 The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.,This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.,This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.,Then they switched to a magnetic drum.,This is modifying IBM equipment,,which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.,And this is the beginning of computer graphics.,The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,,that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954. 
 So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,,doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build,reliable machines out of unreliable components.,Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it,were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all,these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.,And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.,"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes.",This includes a large amount of human error.,So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?,What's code, what's hardware? 
 That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,,trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.,He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.,So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,,let alone having, you know, software problems. 
 "No use, went home." (Laughter) 
 "Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?" 
 So, already, they're complaining about the manuals:,"before closing down in disgust ... " 
 "The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs.",Burning lots of midnight oil. 
 "MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,,Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory." 
 "MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?" 
 "Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem. 
 "Found trouble in code, I hope." 
 "Code error, machine not guilty." 
 "Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And the dawn came." So they ran all night.,Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations. 
 "Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night." 
 "Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter) 
 "Something's wrong with the air conditioner --,smell of burning V-belts in the air." 
 "A short -- do not turn the machine on." 
 "IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.",So they really were working under tough conditions. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower,behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953." 
 (Laughter) 
 There's an inside joke someone has penciled in:,"Here lies Marston Mouse.",If you're a mathematician, you get that,,because Marston was a mathematician who,objected to the computer being there. 
 "Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles.",That's two thousand cycles per second --,"yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.,The high speed was 16 kilocycles.,I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,,that's slow speed. 
 "I have now duplicated both results.,How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?,This now is the third different output.,I know when I'm licked." 
 (Laughter) 
 "We've duplicated errors before." 
 "Machine run, fine. Code isn't." 
 "Only happens when the machine is running." 
 And sometimes things are okay.,"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running." 
 "Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them." 
 So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.,They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,,late one night, finally drew a bomb.,So, that was the result. It was Mike,,the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.,That was designed on that machine,,in the woods behind the Institute. 
 So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos,from all over the world to work on all these problems.,Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,,trying to see if, in this artificial universe --,he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.,He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.,Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.,Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.,So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.,And he saw everything in terms of --,he could read the binary code straight off the machine.,He had a wonderful rapport.,Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.,Even errors were duplicated. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right." 
 So he designed this universe, and ran it.,When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.,He would run that thing all night long, running these things,,if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,,who reinvented this stuff.,And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.,It was published in the literature.,"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?",So, he decided to give it a try,,to start this artificial biology going in the machines.,And he found all these, sort of --,it was like a naturalist coming in,and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,,and seeing all these things happening,that we see in the outside world, in biology.,This is some of the generations of his universe.,But they're just going to stay numbers;,they're not going to become organisms.,They have to have something.,You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.,They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,,started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with --,playing chess with other machines and so on.,And they did start to evolve.,And he went around the country after that.,Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,,and saw exactly what's happening now.,That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program,,you'd keep running,and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,,running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,,he envisioned all that happening.,And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.,It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,,but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation,that would have some intelligence.,And he went out of his way to say,that he was not saying this was lifelike,,or a new kind of life.,It just was another version of the same thing happening.,And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer,and what nature did billions of years ago.,And could you do it again now? 
 So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,,the archivist came up one day, saying,,"I think we found another box that had been thrown out.",And it was his universe on punch cards.,So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.,That's the instructions for running --,this is actually the source code,for one of those universes,,with a note from the engineers,saying they're having some problems.,"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet.",And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand,how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.,What's the dividing line between,when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?,These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.,And the question is, should we run them or not?,You know, could we get them running?,Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?,These machines would think they --,these organisms, if they came back to life now --,whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.,My laptop is 10 thousand million times,the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project. 
 He was thinking far ahead, to,how this would really grow into a new kind of life.,And that's what's happening!,When Juan Enriquez told us about,these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,,of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,,that's what Barricelli imagined:,that this digital code in these machines,is actually starting to code --,it already is coding from nucleic acids.,We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR,and synthesizing small strings of DNA.,And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,,and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world. 
 It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.,This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes,on self-reproducing machines,,what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started,to where they begin to reproduce.,It took really three people:,Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;,Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines --,that now, last count, four million,of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;,and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago --,this is John Markoff's obituary for him --,he was the important missing link,,the engineer who came in,and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.,And all our computers have, inside them,,the copies of the architecture that he had to just design,one day, sort of on pencil and paper.,And we owe a tremendous credit to that.,And he explained, in a very generous way,,the spirit that brought all these different people to,the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,,and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,,no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world. 
 That's the last entry in the logbook,when the machine was shut down, July 1958.,And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight,when the machine was officially turned off.,And that's the end. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,,that we think is going to change the way that,computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.,That technology is simulating humans.,It's simulated humans with a simulated body,and a simulated nervous system to control that body.,Now, before I talk more about that technology,,let's have a quick look at what human characters look like,at the moment in computer games.,This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3.",We already saw that briefly yesterday.,And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.,It's one of the most successful games of all time.,But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.,They pretty much look the same.,I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.,And you can see he looks always the same.,The reason for that is that these characters,are actually not real characters.,They are a graphical visualization of a character. 
 To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate,what's going to happen in the actual game,,and then has to animate that particular sequence.,So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,,and then these particular animations are just played back,at appropriate times in the computer game.,Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.,All you have is animations that are played back,at more or less the appropriate times.,It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,,because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,,what you actually put into it.,There's no real emergence there. 
 And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.,Now, the only way to get around that,is to actually simulate the human body,and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.,And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration,to show what the difference is --,because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.,If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.,If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,,and that's because he has a physical body,,and because he has the motor skills to control that body.,It's a very trivial thing.,It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.,Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it? 
 Torsten Reil: That's it, yes.,So, that's what we're trying to simulate --,not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.,Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,,and we tried to start very simply.,What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.,That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.,So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.,If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.,The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it,that actually makes it work.,And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on,that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine,that controls walking in humans.,It's called the central pattern generator.,So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit,is to teach that network how to walk.,For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms. 
 We heard about those already yesterday,,and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.,But, just briefly, the concept is that,you create a large number of different individuals --,neural networks, in this case --,all of which are random at the beginning.,You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles,of that two-legged creature here --,and hope that it does something interesting.,At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.,Most of them won't move at all,,but some of them might make a tiny step.,Those are then selected by the algorithm,,reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.,And you repeat that process over and over again,,until you have something that walks --,in this case, in a straight line, like this.,So that was the idea behind this.,When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.,It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.,I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,,and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,,like I've just demonstrated,,and this is what I got instead. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, it was back to the drawing board for us.,We did get it to work eventually,,after tweaking a bit here and there.,And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.,So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped,that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.,At the beginning, it can't walk at all,,but it will get better and better over time.,So, this is the one that can't walk at all. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,,the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better. 
 (Laughter) 
 Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more --,still not quite there.,But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.,That was the real breakthrough for us.,It was, academically, quite a challenging project,,and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident,that we could try and do other things as well with this approach --,actually simulating the body,and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.,Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting,for things like computer games or online worlds.,What you see here is the character standing there,,and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.,And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.,Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,,which is what I'm doing now, here,,it will fall over it in a completely different way.,And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there,,are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.,Okay. That's the video. Thanks.,Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important,because this is not something you get at the moment,in any interactive or any virtual worlds.,Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,,because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.,What we really wanted was a full human body.,So we started the company.,We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists,to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on,was to create the human body, basically.,It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,,but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically. 
 So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,,and tried to make it as realistic as possible.,What you see here on the screen right now,is a very simple visualization of that body.,I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,,but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,,so you can concentrate on the movement.,Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,,is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.,Nothing really interesting, basically.,It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.,The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.,It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.,So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --,nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.,But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.,It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.,It's going to stick out its hands.,It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.,So that's what you see here. 
 Now, it gets really interesting,if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.,So here, we've got the same character.,I'm going to push it a bit harder now,,harder than I just pushed Chris.,But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.,What you see is it takes steps backwards,,it tries to counter-balance,,it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.,I'll show you this again.,And then, finally hits the floor.,Now, this becomes really exciting,when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.,That's something that you cannot do right now.,At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.,What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now. 
 So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,,but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.,First, starting with a push from the right.,This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.,Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,,so you can see that the reaction is different.,Again, a push, now this time from the front.,And you see it falls differently.,And now from the left --,and it falls differently.,That was really exciting for us to see that.,That was the first time we've seen that.,This is the first time the public sees this as well,,because we have been in stealth mode.,I haven't shown this to anybody yet.,Now, just a fun thing:,what happens if you put that character --,this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --,but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.,We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is what happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It's nothing we had to do about this.,We just took this character that I just talked about,,put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.,And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.,Now, when we went to film studios and games developers,and showed them that technology, we got a very good response.,And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.,Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,,and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,,because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.,So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman,and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.,And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.,So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.,That's what people want. That's what we're giving them. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see, it's always reacting.,This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,,feels the force and tries to protect its head.,Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.,You feel kind of sorry for that thing,,and we've seen it so many times now that,we don't really care any more. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...,Now, here's another one.,What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,,a strong force applied to the character,,and have the character react to it in midair.,So that you don't have a character that looks limp,,but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,,that looks kind of alive in midair as well.,So this character is going to be hit by a force,,it's going to realize it's in the air,,and it's going to try and, well,,stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.,That's one angle; here's another angle.,We now think that the realism we're achieving with this,is good enough to be used in films. 
 And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.,This is something I just got last night,from an animation studio in London, who are using our software,and experimenting with it right now.,So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,,but in a slightly better rendered version.,So if you look at the character carefully,,you see there are lots of body movements going on,,none of which you have to animate like in the old days.,Animators had to actually animate them.,This is all happening automatically in the simulation.,This is a slightly different angle,,and again a slow motion version of this.,This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.,You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,,change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.,At the moment, doing something like this by hand,would take you probably a couple of days. 
 This is another behavior they requested.,I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.,It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.,In this case, the character's hands,are fixed to a particular point in space,,and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.,And it looks organic. It looks realistic.,You feel kind of sorry for the guy.,It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --,if you render that a bit more realistically. 
 Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you,how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.,And this is all a physical simulation of the body,,using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.,Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was,to create a slightly more complex stunt scene,,and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond,jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.,Got a very short clip here. 
 Yes, you can just about see it here.,In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.,It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.,Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,,"Can we do that ourselves as well?",Can we use the physical simulation of the character,,use artificial intelligence,,put that artificial intelligence into the character,,drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,,and then skydive afterwards,,and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?,We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,,pretty much, to create the simulation.,And that's what it looks like, here.,Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,,and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,,just to see what we'd get out of it.,But what we found over the past few months,is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --,is incredibly powerful.,We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.,There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before. 
 There's so many things we can do with this right now.,The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.,Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,,and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,,for some major productions.,The second thing is video games.,With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.,For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,,that have real bodies that really react.,I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.,Probably starting with sports games,,which are going to become much more interactive.,But I particularly am really excited,about using this technology in online worlds,,like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.,The degree of interactivity you're going to get,is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now. 
 A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.,We've been approached by several simulation companies,,but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,,is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --,to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,,to predict the outcome of operations on these children.,As you probably know,,it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is,if you try and correct the gait. 
 The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,,is what people think right now, is the outcome.,Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.,We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child,and the surgeon can then work on that simulation,and try out different ways to improve that gait,,before he actually commits to an actual surgery.,That's one project we're particularly excited about,,and that's going to start next month.,Just finally, this is only just the beginning.,We can only do several behaviors right now.,The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.,The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.,And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.,Right now, we don't have that,but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage. 
 We do have one unintentional dancer actually,,the last thing I'm going to show you.,This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --,half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.,So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.,That's what we thought was going to come out of this.,But this is what emerged out of it, in the end. 
 (Music) 
 Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.,So, this was not something we actually put in there.,He just started to create that dance himself.,He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.,And what you see after a while --,I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.,And I think -- there you go. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.,That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.,So it's just -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks.,Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,,so thanks very much for your time.,Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Incredible. That was really incredible. 
 TR: Thanks.
