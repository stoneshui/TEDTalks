One of the things I want to establish right from the start,is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.,I just wanted you to know that. 
 So I am indeed a neurosurgeon,,and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,,and what I'm going to tell you about today,is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,,being able to go anywhere in the brain,and turning areas of the brain up or down,to help our patients. 
 So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.,It's been around for about 7,000 years.,In Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,,and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.,And they were trying to -- they knew that the brain was involved,in neurological and psychiatric disease.,They didn't know exactly what they were doing.,Not much has changed, by the way. (Laughter),But they thought that,,if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,,it must be because you are possessed,by an evil spirit.,So if you are possessed by an evil spirit,causing neurologic or psychiatric problems,,then the way to treat this is, of course,,to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape. 
 So this was the thinking back then,,and these individuals made these holes.,Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant,to go through this because, you can tell that,the holes are made partially and then, I think,,there was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly,and it was only a partial hole,,and we know they survived these procedures.,But this was common.,There were some sites where one percent,of all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see,that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,,and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago. 
 Now, in the course of time,,we've come to realize that,different parts of the brain do different things.,So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated,to controlling your movement or your vision,or your memory or your appetite, and so on.,And when things work well, then the nervous system,works well, and everything functions.,But once in a while, things don't go so well,,and there's trouble in these circuits,,and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring,and causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive,and they're not quite working as they should. 
 Now, the manifestation of this,depends on where in the brain these neurons are.,So when these neurons are in the motor circuit,,you get dysfunction in the movement system,,and you get things like Parkinson's disease.,When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,,you get things like depression,,and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,,then you get things like Alzheimer's disease.,So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint,where these disturbances are in the brain,,and we've been able to intervene within these circuits,in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.,So this is very much like choosing the correct station,on the radio dial.,Once you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,,in our case whether it be movement or mood,,we can put the dial there,,and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,,to turn it up or turn it down. 
 So what I'm going to tell you about,is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes,and turning areas of the brain up and down,to see if we can help our patients.,And this is accomplished using this kind of device,,and this is called deep brain stimulation.,So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.,Again, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,,putting an electrode in, and then this electrode,is completely underneath the skin,down to a pacemaker in the chest,,and with a remote control very much like a television remote control,,we can adjust how much electricity we deliver,to these areas of the brain.,We can turn it up or down, on or off.,Now, about a hundred thousand patients in the world,have received deep brain stimulation,,and I'm going to show you some examples,of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,,disorders of mood and disorders of cognition. 
 So this looks something like this when it's in the brain.,You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain,and resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.,I tell my friends that no neuron is safe,from a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach,just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now. 
 Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient,with Parkinson's disease,,and this lady has Parkinson's disease,,and she has these electrodes in her brain,,and I'm going to show you what she's like,when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,,and then we're going to turn it on.,So this looks something like this.,The electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.,(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?,(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.,We're now going to turn it on.,It's on. Just turned it on.,And this works like that, instantly.,And the difference between shaking in this way and not --,(Applause),The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior,of 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.,So we now know how to find these troublemakers,and tell them, "Gentlemen, that's enough.,We want you to stop doing that.",And we do that with electricity.,So we use electricity to dictate how they fire,,and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.,So in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons. 
 We started using this technique in other problems,,and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem,that we encountered, a case of dystonia.,So dystonia is a disorder affecting children.,It's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,,and these children get progressively more and more twisting,until they can't breathe, until they get sores,,urinary infections, and then they die.,So back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,,perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.,There are eight children in the family.,Five of them have dystonia. 
 So here he is.,This boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,,and then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,,then the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,,then the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,,within the course of one or two years of the disease onset,,he could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.,He was crippled, and indeed the natural progression,as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,,progressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.,So he is one of five kids.,The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.,He did not respond to any drugs.,We did not know what to do with this boy.,We did not know what operation to do,,where to go in the brain,,but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,,we reasoned, why don't we try to suppress,the same area in the brain that we suppressed,in Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?,So here he was. We operated on him,hoping that he would get better. We did not know.,So here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,,three months after the procedure, and here he is. 
 (Applause) 
 On the basis of this result, this is now a procedure,that's done throughout the world,,and there have been hundreds of children,that have been helped with this kind of surgery.,This boy is now in university,and leads quite a normal life.,This has been one of the most satisfying cases,that I have ever done in my entire career,,to restore movement and walking to this kind of child. 
 (Applause) 
 We realized that perhaps we could use this technology,not only in circuits that control your movement,but also circuits that control other things,,and the next thing that we took on,was circuits that control your mood.,And we decided to take on depression,,and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,,and as you know, there are many treatments for depression,,with medication and psychotherapy,,even electroconvulsive therapy,,but there are millions of people,,and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression,that do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.,And let's see if we can use this technique,to help these patients with depression. 
 So the first thing we did was, we compared,,what's different in the brain of someone with depression,and someone who is normal,,and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,,and what we noticed is that in patients with depression,compared to normals,,areas of the brain are shut down,,and those are the areas in blue.,So here you really have the blues,,and the areas in blue are areas that are involved,in motivation, in drive and decision-making,,and indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,,those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.,The other thing we discovered,was an area that was overactive, area 25,,seen there in red,,and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.,If I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember,the last time you saw your parent before they died,or a friend before they died,,this area of the brain lights up.,It is the sadness center of the brain.,And so patients with depression have hyperactivity.,The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.,The thermostat is set at 100 degrees,,and the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.,So we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness,and see if we can turn down the thermostat,,can we turn down the activity,,and what will be the consequence of that? 
 So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.,This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.,And we placed electrodes in area 25,,and in the top scan you see before the operation,,area 25, the sadness area is red hot,,and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,,and then, after three months of continuous stimulation,,24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation,,we have a complete reversal of this.,We're able to drive down area 25,,down to a more normal level,,and we're able to turn back online,the frontal lobes of the brain,,and indeed we're seeing very striking results,in these patients with severe depression.,So now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,,and this may become a new procedure,,if it's safe and we find that it's effective,,to treat patients with severe depression. 
 I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation,to treat the motor system,in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.,I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit,in cases of depression.,Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?,(Laughter),Anybody interested in that?,(Applause),Of course we can, right? 
 So what we've decided to do is,we're going to try to turbocharge,the memory circuits in the brain.,We're going to place electrodes within the circuits,that regulate your memory and cognitive function,to see if we can turn up their activity.,Now we're not going to do this in normal people.,We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,,and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease,who have cognitive and memory deficits.,As you know, this is the main symptom,of early onset Alzheimer's disease.,So we've placed electrodes within this circuit,in an area of the brain called the fornix,,which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,,with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,,and whether that can, in turn, help these patients,with Alzheimer's disease. 
 Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,,there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.,The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.,It uses 20 percent of all your --,even though it only weighs two percent --,it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.,Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,,and as you go from being normal,to having mild cognitive impairment,,which is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,,then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.,They shut down. They turn off.,And indeed, what we see is that these areas in red,around the outside ribbon of the brain,are progressively getting more and more blue,until they shut down completely.,This is analogous to having a power failure,in an area of the brain, a regional power failure.,So the lights are out in parts of the brain,in patients with Alzheimer's disease,,and the question is, are the lights out forever,,or can we turn the lights back on?,Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again? 
 So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix,of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,,and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.,And indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,,the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,,predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.,These areas of the brain are shut down.,The lights are out in these areas of the brain.,We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month,or a year, and the areas in red,represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.,And indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain,that were not using glucose to use glucose once again.,So the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,,the lights are out, but there is someone home,,and we're able to turn the power back on,to these areas of the brain, and as we do so,,we expect that their functions will return. 
 So this is now in clinical trials.,We are going to operate on 50 patients,with early Alzheimer's disease,to see whether this is safe and effective,,whether we can improve their neurologic function. 
 (Applause) 
 So the message I want to leave you with today is that,,indeed, there are several circuits in the brain,that are malfunctioning across various disease states,,whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,,depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.,We are now learning to understand what are the circuits,,what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for,the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.,We can now reach those circuits.,We can introduce electrodes within those circuits.,We can graduate the activity of those circuits.,We can turn them down if they are overactive,,if they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,,or we can turn them up if they are underperforming,,and in so doing, we think that we may be able to help,the overall function of the brain. 
 The implications of this, of course, is that we may be able,to modify the symptoms of the disease,,but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence,that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,,and this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,,we not only change the activity but also,some of the reparative functions of the brain,can be harvested. 
 So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion,of indications of this technique.,We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.,One of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,,it involves multidisciplinary work.,It involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,,of basic scientists, of neurologists,,psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface,of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.,And I think that we will see that,we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits,out from the brain as time goes on,,and the consequence of that, of course, will be,that we will be able to help many more patients. 
 Thank you very much.I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.,We're going to use an unusual combination of tools,from game theory and neuroscience,to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line. 
 So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,,used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,,that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life,and it predicts what people are likely to do,and believe others will do,in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.,That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,,games like hide-and-seek, and poker. 
 Here's a simple game to get us started.,Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100,,we're going to compute the average of those numbers,,and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.,So you want to be a little bit below the average number,,but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be,a little bit below the average number as well.,Think about what you might pick.,As you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like,selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?,You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,,but you don't want to wait too late,to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.,You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.,Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,,and then we'll see some data.,Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are,thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.,A lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,,so I think the average will be 50.",They're not being really strategic at all.,"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33." That's a start.,Other people who are a little more sophisticated,,using more working memory,,say, "I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,,and so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33.",They're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.,That's better. And of course, in principle,,you could do three, four or more,,but it starts to get very difficult.,Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse,very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.,This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.,It's something that I've worked on and a few other people,,and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with,some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps,and how the steps of thinking are affected,by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.,A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,,due largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,,is what's called equilibrium analysis.,So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,,you will have learned a little bit about this.,An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody,has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.,It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,,it may not exactly explain what people do,the first time they play these types of economic games,or in situations in the outside world.,In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,,which is everyone wants to be below everyone else,,therefore they'll play zero. 
 Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.,Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s,by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.,This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in,to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.,The contest said, send in your numbers,and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.,And as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.,There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.,There is another spike visible at 22.,And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.,They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.,There's something a little bit noisy around it.,But you can see those spikes, and they're there.,There's another group of people who seem to have,a firm grip on equilibrium analysis,,because they're picking zero or one.,But they lose, right?,Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice,if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.,So they're smart, but poor. 
 (Laughter) 
 Where are these things happening in the brain?,One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.,So they had people play this game,while they were being scanned in an fMRI,,and two conditions: in some trials,,they're told you're playing another person,who's playing right now and we're going to match up,your behavior at the end and pay you if you win.,In the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.,They're just choosing randomly.,So what you see here is a subtraction,of areas in which there's more brain activity,when you're playing people compared to playing the computer.,And you see activity in some regions we've seen today,,medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,,ventromedial prefrontal cortex,,anterior cingulate, an area that's involved,in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,",and also the right and left temporoparietal junction.,And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known,to be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,,or "mentalizing circuit.",That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.,So these were some of the first studies to see this,tied in to game theory. 
 What happens with these one- and two-step types?,So we classify people by what they picked,,and then we look at the difference between,playing humans versus playing computers,,which brain areas are differentially active.,On the top you see the one-step players.,There's almost no difference.,The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.,The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.,So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently. 
 Now if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?",you might be able to look at brain activity and say,,"This person's going to be a good poker player,",or, "This person's socially naive,",and we might also be able to study things,like development of adolescent brains,once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. 
 Okay. Get ready.,I'm saving you some brain activity,,because you don't need to use your hair detector cells.,You should use those cells to think carefully about this game.,This is a bargaining game.,Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes,are going to bargain over one to six dollars.,If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.,If 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.,That's kind of a mistake together.,The twist is that one player, on the left,,is informed about how much on each trial there is.,They play lots of trials with different amounts each time.,In this case, they know there's four dollars.,The uninformed player doesn't know,,but they know that the informed player knows.,So the uninformed player's challenge is to say,,"Is this guy really being fair,or are they giving me a very low offer,in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?",in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.,So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money,but trying to goad the other player into giving you more.,And the way they bargain is to point on a number line,that goes from zero to six dollars,,and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,,and the informed player's going to get the rest.,So this is like a management-labor negotiation,in which the workers don't know how much profits,the privately held company has, right,,and they want to maybe hold out for more money,,but the company might want to create the impression,that there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can." 
 First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.,We have some other data where they play across computers.,That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.,But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs,agree to divide the money evenly every single time.,Boring. It's just not interesting neurally.,It's good for them. They make a lot of money.,But we're interested in, can we say something about,when disagreements occur versus don't occur? 
 So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.,So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree,and end up with less money.,They might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show.,You see on the left,,when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,,they disagree about half the time,,and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.,This turns out to be something that's predicted,by a very complicated type of game theory,you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.,It's a little too complicated to explain right now,,but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.,Your intuition might tell you that too. 
 Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.,Very complicated. The right brain schematic,is the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.,Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time,,so we can ask about time-synced activity,in similar or different areas simultaneously,,just like if you wanted to study a conversation,and you were scanning two people talking to each other,and you'd expect common activity in language regions,when they're actually kind of listening and communicating.,So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,,and the direction of the arrows flows,from the region that's active first in time,,and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.,So in this case, if you look carefully,,most of the arrows flow from right to left.,That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity,is happening first,,and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.,And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.,This is from the first two seconds.,We haven't finished analyzing this data,,so we're still peeking in, but the hope is,that we can say something in the first couple of seconds,about whether they'll make a deal or not,,which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation,and ugly divorces and things like that.,Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost,by delay and strikes. 
 Here's the case where the disagreements occur.,You can see it looks different than the one before.,There's a lot more arrows.,That means that the brains are synced up,more closely in terms of simultaneous activity,,and the arrows flow clearly from left to right.,That is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,,"We're probably not going to make a deal here.",And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain. 
 Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.,They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.,You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.,Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.,Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree,from chimpanzees about five million years ago.,They're still our closest genetic kin.,We share 98.8 percent of the genes.,We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.,And we're also their closest cousin.,They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.,So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently,might tell us a lot about brain evolution. 
 So this is an amazing memory test,from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,,where they've done a lot of this research.,This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.,The chimp is going to see, watch carefully,,they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure,— that's fast, that's eight movie frames —,of numbers one, two, three, four, five.,Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares,,and they have to press the squares,that correspond to the numbers from low to high,to get an apple reward.,Let's see how they can do it.,This is a young chimp. The young ones,are better than the old ones, just like humans.,And they're highly experienced, so they've done this,thousands and thousands of time.,Obviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.,(Laughter),You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.,Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.,Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?,Wrong. (Laughter),We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try. 
 Okay, so the next part of this study,I'm going to go quickly through,is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.,He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.,We know chimps are faster and stronger.,They're also very obsessed with status.,His thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities,and they practice them in development,that are really, really important to them,to negotiate status and to win,,which is something like strategic thinking during competition.,So we're going to check that out,by having the chimps actually play a game,by touching two touch screens.,The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.,They're going to press left or right.,One chimp is called a matcher.,They win if they press left, left,,like a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.,The mismatcher wants to mismatch.,They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.,And the rewards are apple cube rewards.,So here's how game theorists look at these data.,This is a graph of the percentage of times,the matcher picked right on the x-axis,,and the percentage of times they predicted right,by the mismatcher on the y-axis.,So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,,one trying to match, one trying to mismatch.,The NE square in the middle -- actually NE, CH and QRE --,those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,,tells you what the theory predicts,,which is that they should match 50-50,,because if you play left too much, for example,,I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.,And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,,are circled around, hovering around that prediction. 
 Now we move the payoffs.,We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.,Now they get three apple cubes.,Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,,because what happens is, the mismatcher will think,,oh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,,and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.,And as you can see, their behavior moves up,in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.,Finally, we changed the payoffs one more time.,Now it's four apple cubes,,and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.,It's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,,they're really, really close, within .01.,They're actually closer than any species we've observed. 
 What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?,Here's two human groups in green and blue.,They're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,,and also if you study their learning in the game,,they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.,The chimps are playing better than the humans,,better in the sense of adhering to game theory.,And these are two different groups of humans,from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.,None of them are close to where the chimps are. 
 So here are some things we learned today.,People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking,using theory of mind.,We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining,that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict,whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,,and chimps are better competitors than humans,,as judged by game theory.,Thank you.,(Applause)So raise your hand if you know someone,in your immediate family or circle of friends,who suffers from some form of mental illness.,Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised. 
 And raise your hand if you think that,basic research on fruit flies has anything to do,with understanding mental illness in humans.,Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.,I can see I've got my work cut out for me here. 
 As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,,psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia,take a terrible toll on human suffering.,We know much less about their treatment,and the understanding of their basic mechanisms,than we do about diseases of the body.,Think about it: In 2013,,the second decade of the millennium,,if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis,and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,,biopsies and blood tests.,In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,,you go to your doctor, and what do you get?,A questionnaire.,Now, part of the reason for this is that we have,an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view,of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.,We tend to view them --,and the popular press aids and abets this view --,as chemical imbalances in the brain,,as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup,full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.,This view is conditioned by the fact,that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,,like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,,as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.,But that can't be the answer,,because these drugs actually don't work all that well.,A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,,because of their unpleasant side effects.,These drugs have so many side effects,because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder,is a bit like trying to change your engine oil,by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.,Some of it will dribble into the right place,,but a lot of it will do more harm than good. 
 Now, an emerging view,that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,,is that psychiatric disorders are actually,disturbances of neural circuits that mediate,emotion, mood and affect.,When we think about cognition,,we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.,Well it turns out that the computer analogy,is just as valid for emotion.,It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.,But we know much less about the circuit basis,of psychiatric disorders,because of the overwhelming dominance,of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. 
 Now, it's not that chemicals are not important,in psychiatric disorders.,It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.,Rather, they're released in very specific locations,and they act on specific synapses,to change the flow of information in the brain.,So if we ever really want to understand,the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,,we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain,where these chemicals act.,Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines,and suffering the consequences. 
 Now to begin to overcome our ignorance,of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,,it's helpful to work on what we biologists call,"model organisms,",animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,,in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques,to molecularly identify and pinpoint,specific classes of neurons,,as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.,Moreover, once we can do that,,we can actually activate specific neurons,or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.,So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,,and we find that a behavior is blocked,,we can conclude that those neurons,are necessary for that behavior.,On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons,and we find that that produces the behavior,,we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.,So in this way, by doing this kind of test,,we can draw cause and effect relationships,between the activity of specific neurons,in particular circuits and particular behaviors,,something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,,to do right now in humans. 
 But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --,it's a great model organism,because it's got a small brain,,it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,,it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.,But can an organism like this,teach us anything about emotion-like states?,Do these organisms even have emotion-like states,,or are they just little digital robots? 
 Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion,and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote,in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.,And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.,Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila,here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism,to study the connection between genes and behavior.,Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.,He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,,and Seymour taught me both to love flies,and also to play with science. 
 So how do we ask this question?,It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,,but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?,Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,,as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.,However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.,(Laughter),It's kind of like landing on Mars,and looking out the window of your spaceship,at all the little green men who are surrounding it,and trying to figure out, "How do I find out,if they have emotions or not?",What can we do? It's not so easy. 
 Well, one of the ways that we can start,is to try to come up with some general characteristics,or properties of emotion-like states,such as arousal, and see if we can identify,any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.,So three important ones that I can think of,are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.,Persistence means long-lasting.,We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion,causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.,Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.,You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.,If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth,turn down and you sniffle,,and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face,and you might sob.,Valence means good or bad, positive or negative. 
 So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing,the kind of behavior that you see,by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,,you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger,the more vigorously you try to swat it away,,and it seems to keep getting irritated.,So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,,in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies,in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench,and blow them away.,And what we found is that if we gave these flies,in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,,they became somewhat hyperactive,and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped,and took a while to calm down.,So we quantified this behavior,using custom locomotor tracking software,developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,,who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.,And what this quantification showed us is that,,upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,,the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity,which is persistent, long-lasting,,and also appears to be graded.,More puffs, or more intense puffs,,make the state last for a longer period of time. 
 So now we wanted to try to understand something,about what controls the duration of this state.,So we decided to use our puff-o-mat,and our automated tracking software,to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies,to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.,And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.,There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone,and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants,and screen them in your assay and then find out,what gene is affected in the mutation.,So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant,that took much longer than normal to calm down,after the air puffs,,and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,,it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.,That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,,and it acts on their brains and on their synapses,through the same dopamine receptor molecules,that you and I have.,Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,,including in attention, arousal, reward,,and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked,to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,,Parkinson's disease, and ADHD. 
 Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.,We tend to infer the normal function of something,by what doesn't happen when we take it away,,by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.,So when we take away the dopamine receptor,and the flies take longer to calm down,,from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine,is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.,And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,,which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.,Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies,by feeding them cocaine,after getting the appropriate DEA license,— oh my God -- (Laughter) —,we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies,calm down faster than normal flies do,,and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,,which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin,that act similarly to cocaine.,So slowly I began to realize that what started out,as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies,might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. 
 Now, how far does this analogy go?,As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD,also have learning disabilities.,Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?,Remarkably, the answer is yes.,As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,,flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,,are capable of learning.,You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,,if you pair that odor with a shock.,Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose,between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,,it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.,Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,,they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.,They flunk out of CalTech. 
 So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,,or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,,that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.,Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?,In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity,causes the learning disability.,The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.,But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities,that cause the hyperactivity.,Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.,And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all,between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,,but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD. 
 Now people have been wondering about this for a long time,in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.,And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind,of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.,We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies,and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor,by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene,back into the fly brain.,But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons,and not in others, and then we test each of these flies,for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity. 
 Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.,If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back,in this elliptical structure called the central complex,,the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.,On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure,called the mushroom body,,the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,,but they're still hyperactive.,What that tells us is that dopamine,is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.,Rather, it's acting to control two different functions,on two different circuits,,so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies,is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions,in two different regions of the brain.,Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans,we don't know, but these kinds of results,should at least cause us to consider that possibility. 
 So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever,that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,,and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders,just by changing the flavor of the soup.,What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge,to try to design a new generation of treatments,that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain,that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.,If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders,without the unpleasant side effects,,putting the oil back in our mental engines,,just where it's needed. Thank you very much.I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.,Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,,creatures from a far-distant world.,But basically, I figured out that I could find,those alien creatures right on Earth. 
 And what I do is I study insects.,I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.,I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps,one of the most important events in the history of life.,Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.,Without flowering plants, there would be no,clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now,,David and Hidehiko and Ketaki,gave a very compelling story about,the similarities between fruit flies and humans,,and there are many similarities,,and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,,the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --,(Laughter),but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities,between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,,and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing. 
 And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence,of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,,and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator,that is going to go at the fly.,The fly is going to sense this predator.,It is going to extend its legs out.,It's going to sashay away,to live to fly another day.,Now I have carefully cropped this sequence,to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,,so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,,the fly has seen this looming predator,,estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,,beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.,I think this is a fascinating behavior,that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information. 
 Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?,Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,,you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,,you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,,and you need a controller,,and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically,the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit. 
 Now, how does this compare to a fly?,Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out,how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.,And you might have heard how engineers proved,that bumblebees couldn't fly.,Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings,function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.,And we tackle this problem by building giant,,dynamically scaled model robot insects,that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil,where we could study the aerodynamic forces.,And it turns out that the insects flap their wings,in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack,that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,,a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,,and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings,to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.,But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating,is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.,What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,,which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,,and this is what enables flies to perform,these remarkable aerial maneuvers. 
 Now, what about the engine?,The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.,They have two types of flight muscle:,so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,,which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled,on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.,It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,,and it fills the middle portion of the fly,,so when a fly hits your windshield,,it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.,But attached to the base of the wing,is a set of little, tiny control muscles,that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,,and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing,on a stroke-by-stroke basis,,and this is what enables the fly to change its wing,and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces,which change its flight trajectory.,And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this. 
 So let's look at the controller.,Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors,that they carry to this problem.,They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.,They have a sophisticated eye which is,the fastest visual system on the planet.,They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.,We have no idea what they do.,They have sensors on their wing.,Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors,that sense deformation of the wing.,They can even taste with their wings.,One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has,is a structure called the halteres.,The halteres are actually gyroscopes.,These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,,and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation,and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.,But all of this sensory information has to be processed,by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,,a brain of about 100,000 neurons. 
 Now several people at this conference,have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience,because they're a simple model of brain function.,And the basic punchline of my talk is,,I'd like to turn that over on its head.,I don't think they're a simple model of anything.,And I think that flies are a great model.,They're a great model for flies.,(Laughter) 
 And let's explore this notion of simplicity.,So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,,we're all somewhat narcissistic.,When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.,But remember that this kind of brain,,which is much, much smaller,— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —,but this is the most common form of brain on the planet,and has been for 400 million years.,And is it fair to say that it's simple?,Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,,but is that a fair metric?,And I would propose it's not a fair metric.,So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --,(Laughter) —,we have to compare the size of the brain,with what the brain can do.,So I propose we have a Trump number,,and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's,behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.,We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.,Now, how many people here think the Trump number,is higher for the fruit fly? 
 (Applause) 
 It's a very smart, smart audience.,Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it. 
 Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd,to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.,But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.,A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.,I used to study mice. When I studied mice,,I used to talk really slowly.,And then something happened when I started to work on flies.,(Laughter),And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,,it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.,They have to engage in courtship.,They have sex. They hide from predators.,They do a lot of the similar things.,But I would argue that flies do more.,So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,,and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,,so I'm showing this classified sequence,and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?,So I want you to look at the payload,at the tail of the fruit fly.,Watch it very closely,,and you'll see why my six-year-old son,now wants to be a neuroscientist.,Wait for it.,Pshhew.,So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,,they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter) 
 Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers,but also the challenge for a fly to compute,everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.,So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse,that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,,and you can see the wonderful images of brains,that he showed in his talk.,But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,,at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.,And I'll expand this up.,And it's a beautifully complex neuron.,It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges,with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons. 
 How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.,It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,,it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,,it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars,to parasatize,,but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,,which is comparable for a fruit fly,,it is the size of a salt grain.,So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.,This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,,and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --,you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,,where the nucleus of the neuron is?,This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.,So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.,I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works. 
 But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?,And I think, from an engineering perspective,,you think of multiplexing.,You can take a hardware and have that hardware,do different things at different times,,or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.,And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.,And they're not concepts that I've come up with,,but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past. 
 And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.,And I don't mean chewing the crabs.,I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.,But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.,Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.,Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace,called the gastric mill,that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.,And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.,The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled,by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons,that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,,and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion,in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.,You heard about neuromodulators earlier.,There are more neuromodulators,that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,,and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.,And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues,who've been studying this fascinating system,that show how a smaller cluster of neurons,can do many, many, many things,because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.,So this is basically multiplexing in time.,Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.,You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,,another neuromodulator, another set of cells,,a different pattern, and you can imagine,you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system. 
 Is there any evidence that flies do this?,Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,,we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.,You can tether a fly to a little stick.,You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.,You can let the fly play a little video game,by letting it fly around in a visual display.,So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.,Here's a fly,and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,,and this is a game the flies love to play.,You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,,and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.,It's part of their visual guidance system.,But very, very recently, it's been possible,to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.,So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,,Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,,and it's basically a flight simulator,but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode,in the brain of the fly and record,from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.,And this is what one of these experiments looks like.,It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,,Bettina Schnell.,The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential,of a neuron in the fly's brain,,and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually,controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself,by its own wing motion,,and you can see this visual interneuron,respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.,So for the first time we've actually been able to record,from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly,is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.,And one of the lessons we've been learning,is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying,for many years in quiescent flies,is not the same as the physiology of those cells,when the flies actually engage in active behaviors,like flying and walking and so forth.,And why is the physiology different?,Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,,just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.,So here's a picture of the octopamine system.,Octopamine is a neuromodulator,that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.,But this is just one of many neuromodulators,that's in the fly's brain.,So I really think that, as we learn more,,it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain,is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,,and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons. 
 Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing,is multiplexing in space,,having different parts of a neuron,do different things at the same time.,So here's two sort of canonical neurons,from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,,a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,,and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,,and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,,and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea,based on the fact that this neuron from a locust,does not fire action potentials.,It's a non-spiking cell.,So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,,has a region called the dendrites that receives input,,and that input sums together,and will produce action potentials,that run down the axon and then activate,all the output regions of the neuron.,But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated,because they can have input synapses and output synapses,all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential,that drives all the outputs at the same time.,So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments,that allow the different parts of the neuron,to do different things at the same time. 
 So these basic concepts of multitasking in time,and multitasking in space,,I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,,but I think the insects are the true masters of this.,So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,,and as I say up here, please think before you swat. 
 (Applause)So let's start with some good news,,and the good news has to do with what do we know,based on biomedical research,that actually has changed the outcomes,for many very serious diseases? 
 Let's start with leukemia,,acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,,the most common cancer of children.,When I was a student,,the mortality rate was about 95 percent.,Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about,a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.,Six thousand children each year,who would have previously died of this disease are cured.,If you want the really big numbers,,look at these numbers for heart disease.,Heart disease used to be the biggest killer,,particularly for men in their 40s.,Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality,from heart disease --,remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.,AIDS, incredibly, has just been named,,in the past month, a chronic disease,,meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV,is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,,as we said only a decade ago,,but is thought to live decades,,probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.,These are just remarkable, remarkable changes,in the outlook for some of the biggest killers.,And one in particular,that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,,which has been, along with heart disease,,one of the biggest killers in this country,,is a disease in which now we know,that if you can get people into the emergency room,within three hours of the onset,,some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital,without any disability whatsoever. 
 Remarkable stories,,good-news stories,,all of which boil down to understanding,something about the diseases that has allowed us,to detect early and intervene early.,Early detection, early intervention,,that's the story for these successes. 
 Unfortunately, the news is not all good.,Let's talk about one other story,which has to do with suicide.,Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se.,It's a condition, or it's a situation,that leads to mortality.,What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.,There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.,That means one about every 15 minutes.,Third most common cause of death amongst people,between the ages of 15 and 25.,It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize,that this is twice as common as homicide,and actually more common as a source of death,than traffic fatalities in this country.,Now, when we talk about suicide,,there is also a medical contribution here,,because 90 percent of suicides,are related to a mental illness:,depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,,anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list,of disorders that contribute,,and as I mentioned before, often early in life. 
 But it's not just the mortality from these disorders.,It's also morbidity.,If you look at disability,,as measured by the World Health Organization,with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,,it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of,except an economist,,except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost,in terms of disability from medical causes,,and as you can see, virtually 30 percent,of all disability from all medical causes,can be attributed to mental disorders,,neuropsychiatric syndromes. 
 You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.,I mean, cancer seems far more serious.,Heart disease seems far more serious.,But you can see actually they are further down this list,,and that's because we're talking here about disability.,What drives the disability for these disorders,like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?,Why are they number one here? 
 Well, there are probably three reasons.,One is that they're highly prevalent.,About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders,in the course of their lifetime.,A second, of course, is that, for some people,,these become truly disabling,,and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.,But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,,and to some extent the high mortality,,is the fact that these start very early in life.,Fifty percent will have onset by age 14,,75 percent by age 24,,a picture that is very different than what one would see,if you're talking about cancer or heart disease,,diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses,that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.,These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people. 
 Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.,This is obviously not one of them.,This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,,and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.,My job is to actually make sure that we make progress,on all of these disorders.,I work for the federal government.,Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary.,And maybe at this point, when you know what I do,,or maybe what I've failed to do,,you'll think that I probably ought to be fired,,and I could certainly understand that.,But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here,is to tell you that I think we're about to be,in a very different world as we think about these illnesses. 
 What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,,diseases of the mind.,That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,,and people feel that, for whatever reason,,it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders,and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.,Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior,,and they are disorders of the mind.,But what I want to suggest to you,is that both of those terms,,which have been in play for a century or more,,are actually now impediments to progress,,that what we need conceptually to make progress here,is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders. 
 Now, for some of you, you're going to say,,"Oh my goodness, here we go again.,We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance,or we're going to hear about drugs,or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion,that will take our subjective experience,and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of,very flat, unidimensional understanding,of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia. 
 When we talk about the brain, it is anything but,unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.,It depends, of course, on what scale,or what scope you want to think about,,but this is an organ of surreal complexity,,and we are just beginning to understand,how to even study it, whether you're thinking about,the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex,or the 100 trillion synapses,that make up all the connections.,We have just begun to try to figure out,how do we take this very complex machine,that does extraordinary kinds of information processing,and use our own minds to understand,this very complex brain that supports our own minds.,It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution,that we simply don't have a brain,that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.,In a sense, it actually makes you feel that,when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,,something you can observe,,that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic,than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ,that we're beginning to try to understand. 
 Now, already in the case of the brain disorders,that I've been talking to you about,,depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,,post-traumatic stress disorder,,while we don't have an in-depth understanding,of how they are abnormally processed,or what the brain is doing in these illnesses,,we have been able to already identify,some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways,in which the circuitry is different,for people who have these disorders.,We call this the human connectome,,and you can think about the connectome,sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.,You'll hear more about this in a few minutes.,The important piece here is that as you begin to look,at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us,who struggle in some way,,you find that there's a lot of variation,in the way that the brain is wired,,but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns,are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.,It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders,like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease,where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.,Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,,or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected,and the way that the brain functions.,You could, if you want, compare this to,,on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,,where you have dead tissue in the heart,,versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning,because of the communication problems within it.,Either one would kill you; in only one of them,will you find a major lesion. 
 As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go,a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,,because I think that's a good case,for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.,These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues,at the National Institute of Mental Health,in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,,and you can see already in the top,there's areas that are red or orange, yellow,,are places where there's less gray matter,,and as they followed them over five years,,comparing them to age match controls,,you can see that, particularly in areas like,the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.,And it's important, if you try to model this,,you can think about normal development,as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,,and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,,and at some point, when you overshoot,,you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold,where we say, this is a person who has this disease,,because they have the behavioral symptoms,of hallucinations and delusions.,That's something we can observe.,But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.,They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,,that perhaps not at age 22 or 20,,but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see,the trajectory for development is quite different,at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior. 
 Why does this matter? Well first because,,for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.,We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.,There are changes in the brain a decade or more,before you see the first signs of a behavioral change.,The tools that we have now allow us to detect,these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.,But most important, go back to where we started.,The good-news stories in medicine,are early detection, early intervention.,If we waited until the heart attack,,we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives,every year in this country to heart disease.,That is precisely what we do today,when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,,brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.,We wait until the behavior becomes manifest.,That's not early detection. That's not early intervention. 
 Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.,We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know,what the tools will be,,nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able,to get there before the behavior emerges as different.,But this tells us how we need to think about it,,and where we need to go. 
 Are we going to be there soon?,I think that this is something that will happen,over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish,with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen,by somebody who's thought a lot about changes,in concepts and changes in technology. 
 "We always overestimate the change that will occur,in the next two years and underestimate,the change that will occur in the next 10." -- Bill Gates. 
 Thanks very much.,(Applause)(Mechanical noises) 
 (Music),(Applause)There's an old joke about a cop,who's walking his beatnin the middle of the night,,and he comes across a guynunder a street lamp,who's looking at the groundnand moving from side to side,,and the cop asks him what he's doing.,The guys says he's looking for his keys.,So the cop takes his time,and looks over and kind ofnmakes a little matrix,and looks for about two, three minutes.,No keys. 
 The cop says, "Are you sure?,Hey buddy, are you surenyou lost your keys here?" 
 And the guy says,n"No, actually I lost them,down at the other end of the street,,but the light is better here." 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a concept that people talknabout nowadays called "big data.",And what they're talkingnabout is all of the information,that we're generatingnthrough our interaction,with and over the Internet,,everything from Facebook and Twitter,to music downloads, movies,nstreaming, all this kind of stuff,,the live streaming of TED.,And the folks who worknwith big data, for them,,they talk about that their biggest problem,is we have so much information.,The biggest problem is: how do wenorganize all that information? 
 I can tell you that,nworking in global health,,that is not our biggest problem.,Because for us, even thoughnthe light is better on the Internet,,the data that would help us solventhe problems we're trying to solve,is not actually present on the Internet.,So we don't know, for example,,how many people right nownare being affected by disasters,or by conflict situations.,We don't know for, really,nbasically, any of the clinics,in the developing world,,which ones have medicinesnand which ones don't.,We have no idea of whatnthe supply chain is for those clinics.,We don't know -- and this is reallynamazing to me -- we don't know,how many children were born --nor how many children there are --,in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.,We don't know how many kids died last week,in any of those countries.,We don't know the needsnof the elderly, the mentally ill.,For all of these differentncritically important problems,or critically important areasnthat we want to solve problems in,,we basically know nothing at all. 
 And part of the reasonnwhy we don't know anything at all,is that the information technology systemsnthat we use in global health,to find the data to solventhese problems is what you see here.,This is about a 5,000-year-old technology.,Some of you may have used it before.,It's kind of on its way out now,,but we still use itnfor 99 percent of our stuff.,This is a paper form.,And what you're looking at is a paper form,in the hand of a Ministry of Healthnnurse in Indonesia,,who is tramping out across the countryside,in Indonesia on, I'm sure,na very hot and humid day,,and she is going to be knockingnon thousands of doors,over a period of weeks or months,,knocking on the doors and saying,,"Excuse me, we'd like to asknyou some questions.,Do you have any children?nWere your children vaccinated?" 
 Because the only waynwe can actually find out,how many children were vaccinatednin the country of Indonesia,,what percentage were vaccinated,,is actually not on the Internet,nbut by going out and knocking on doors,,sometimes tens of thousands of doors.,Sometimes it takes months to even yearsnto do something like this.,You know, a census of Indonesia,would probably takentwo years to accomplish. 
 And the problem, of course,nwith all of this,is that, with all those paper forms --,and I'm telling you, we havenpaper forms for every possible thing:,We have paper formsnfor vaccination surveys.,We have paper forms to tracknpeople who come into clinics.,We have paper forms to trackndrug supplies, blood supplies --,all these different paper formsnfor many different topics,,they all have a single, common endpoint,,and the common endpointnlooks something like this.,And what we're lookingnat here is a truckful of data.,This is the data from a singlenvaccination coverage survey,in a single districtnin the country of Zambia,from a few years ago,nthat I participated in.,The only thing anyonenwas trying to find out,is what percentage of Zambiannchildren are vaccinated,,and this is the data,ncollected on paper over weeks,,from a single district,,which is something like a countynin the United States.,You can imagine that,nfor the entire country of Zambia,,answering just that single question ...,looks something like this.,Truck after truck after truck,,filled with stack after stacknafter stack of data. 
 And what makes it even worsenis that's just the beginning.,Because once you've collectednall that data,,of course, someone --nsome unfortunate person --,is going to have to type thatninto a computer.,When I was a graduate student,,I actually was that unfortunatenperson sometimes.,I can tell you, I often wasn'tnreally paying attention.,I probably made a lotnof mistakes when I did it,that no one ever discovered,nso data quality goes down. 
 But eventually that data, hopefully,ngets typed into a computer,,and someone can begin to analyze it,,and once they havenan analysis and a report,,hopefully, then you can takenthe results of that data collection,and use it to vaccinate children better. 
 Because if there's anything worsenin the field of global public health --,I don't know what's worsenthan allowing children on this planet,to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --,diseases for whichnthe vaccine costs a dollar.,And millions of children dienof these diseases every year.,And the fact is, millionsnis a gross estimate,,because we don't really knownhow many kids die each year of this. 
 What makes it even more frustratingnis that the data-entry part,,the part that I used to donas a grad student,,can take sometimes six months.,Sometimes it can take two yearsnto type that information into a computer,,And sometimes, actually not infrequently,,it actually never happens.,Now try and wrap your headnaround that for a second.,You just had teams of hundreds of people.,They went out into the fieldnto answer a particular question.,You probably spent hundredsnof thousands of dollars,on fuel and photocopying and per diem.,And then for some reason, momentum is lost,or there's no money left,,and all of that comes to nothing,,because no one actually types itninto the computer at all.,The process just stops.,Happens all the time.,This is what we basenour decisions on in global health:,little data, old data, no data. 
 So back in 1995,,I began to think about waysnin which we could improve this process.,Now 1995 -- obviously,nthat was quite a long time ago.,It kind of frightens me to thinknof how long ago that was.,The top movie of the yearnwas "Die Hard with a Vengeance.",As you can see, Bruce Willisnhad a lot more hair back then.,I was working in the Centersnfor Disease Control,and I had a lot morenhair back then as well. 
 But to me, the most significantnthing that I saw in 1995,was this.,Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,,this was the ultimate elite mobile device.,It wasn't an iPhone.nIt wasn't a Galaxy phone.,It was a PalmPilot.,And when I saw the PalmPilotnfor the first time, I thought,,"Why can't we put the formsnon these PalmPilots?,And go out into the fieldnjust carrying one PalmPilot,,which can hold the capacitynof tens of thousands of paper forms?,Why don't we try to do that?,Because if we can do that,,if we can actually just collectnthe data electronically, digitally,,from the very beginning,,we can just put a shortcut rightnthrough that whole process,of typing, of having somebody typenthat stuff into the computer.,We can skip straight to the analysis,and then straight to the usenof the data to actually save lives." 
 So that's what I began to do.,Working at CDC, I began to travelnto different programs around the world,and to train them in usingnPalmPilots to do data collection,,instead of using paper.,And it actually worked great.,It worked exactly as wellnas anybody would have predicted.,What do you know?,Digital data collection is actuallynmore efficient than collecting on paper.,While I was doing it, my business partner,,Rose, who's here with her husband,nMatthew, here in the audience,,Rose was out doing similar stuffnfor the American Red Cross. 
 The problem was,nafter a few years of doing that,,I realized -- I had been to maybensix or seven programs --,and I thought, you know,nif I keep this up at this pace,,over my whole career,,maybe I'm going to gonto maybe 20 or 30 programs.,But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,,like, training 20 or 30 programsnto use this technology,,that is a tiny drop in the bucket.,The demand for this, the neednfor data to run better programs,just within health -- not to mentionnall of the other fields,in developing countries -- is enormous.,There are millions and millionsnand millions of programs,,millions of clinicsnthat need to track drugs,,millions of vaccine programs.,There are schoolsnthat need to track attendance.,There are all these different thingsnfor us to get the data that we need to do.,And I realized if I kept upnthe way that I was doing,,I was basically hardlyngoing to make any impact,by the end of my career. 
 And so I began to rack my brain,,trying to think about, whatnwas the process that I was doing?,How was I training folks,,and what were the bottlenecksnand what were the obstacles,to doing it fasternand to doing it more efficiently?,And, unfortunately, after thinkingnabout this for some time,,I identified the main obstacle.,And the main obstacle, it turned out --,and this is a sad realization --,the main obstacle was me. 
 So what do I mean by that?,I had developed a process,whereby I was the centernof the universe of this technology.,If you wanted to use this technology,nyou had to get in touch with me.,That means you had to know I existed.,Then you had to find the moneynto pay for me to fly out to your country,and the money to pay for my hotelnand my per diem and my daily rate.,So you could be talkingnabout 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,,if I actually had the timenor it fit my schedule,and I wasn't on vacation.,The point is that anything,,any system that dependsnon a single human being,or two or three or five human beings --,it just doesn't scale.,And this is a problem for whichnwe need to scale this technology,,and we need to scale it now. 
 And so I began to think of waysnin which I could basically,take myself out of the picture.,And, you know, I was thinking,,"How could I take myselfnout of the picture?",for quite some time.,I'd been trained that the waynyou distribute technology,within international development,is always consultant-based.,It's always guysnthat look pretty much like me,,flying from countriesnthat look pretty much like this,to other countriesnwith people with darker skin.,And you go out there,nand you spend money on airfare,and you spend time and you spend per diem,and you spend for a hotelnand all that stuff.,As far as I knew, that was the only waynyou could distribute technology,,and I couldn't figure out a way around it. 
 But the miracle that happened --,I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.,You may not think of Hotmailnas being miraculous,,but for me it was miraculous,,because I noticed, just as Inwas wrestling with this problem --,I was working in sub-SaharannAfrica, mostly, at the time --,I noticed that every sub-SaharannAfrican health worker,that I was working withnhad a Hotmail account.,And it struck me, "Wait a minute --,I know the Hotmail people surely didn'tnfly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya,to train people in how to use Hotmail.,So these guys are distributing technology,ngetting software capacity out there,,but they're not actuallynflying around the world.,I need to think about this more.",While I was thinking about it,,people started using even morenthings like this, just as we were.,They started using LinkedIn and Flickrnand Gmail and Google Maps --,all these things.,Of course, all of these thingsnare cloud based,and don't require any training.,They don't require any programmers.,They don't require consultants.,Because the business modelnfor all these businesses,requires that something be so simplenwe can use it ourselves,,with little or no training.,You just have to hear about itnand go to the website. 
 And so I thought, what would happennif we built software,to do what I'd been consulting in?,Instead of training peoplenhow to put forms onto mobile devices,,let's create software that lets themndo it themselves with no training,and without me being involved.,And that's exactly what we did. 
 So we created software called Magpi,nwhich has an online form creator.,No one has to speak to me,,you just have to hear about itnand go to the website.,You can create forms,nand once you've created the forms,,you push them to a varietynof common mobile phones.,Obviously, nowadays, we've movednpast PalmPilots to mobile phones.,And it doesn't have to be a smartphone,nit can be a basic phone,,like the phone on the right,nthe basic Symbian phone,that's very commonnin developing countries.,And the great part about thisnis it's just like Hotmail.,It's cloud based,,and it doesn't require any training,nprogramming, consultants. 
 But there are somenadditional benefits as well.,Now we knew when we built this system,,the whole point of it,njust like with the PalmPilots,,was that you'd be able to collect the data,and immediately uploadnthe data and get your data set.,But what we found, of course,nsince it's already on a computer,,we can deliver instant mapsnand analysis and graphing.,We can take a process that took two years,and compress thatndown to the space of five minutes.,Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.,Cloud based, no training,nno consultants, no me. 
 And I told you that in the first few years,of trying to do thisnthe old-fashioned way,,going out to each country,,we probably trained about 1,000 people.,What happened after we did this?,In the second three years,,we had 14,000 people find the website,,sign up and start using itnto collect data:,data for disaster response,,Canadian pig farmersntracking pig disease and pig herds,,people tracking drug supplies. 
 One of my favorite examples, the IRC,nInternational Rescue Committee,,they have a programnwhere semi-literate midwives,,using $10 mobile phones,,send a text messagenusing our software, once a week,,with the number of birthsnand the number of deaths,,which gives IRC something that no onenin global health has ever had:,a near-real-time systemnof counting babies,,of knowing how many kids are born,,of knowing how many childrennthere are in Sierra Leone,,which is the countrynwhere this is happening,,and knowing how many children die. 
 Physicians for Human Rights --,this is moving a little bitnoutside the health field --,they're basically training peoplento do rape exams in Congo,,where this is an epidemic,,a horrible epidemic,,and they're using our softwarento document the evidence they find,,including photographically,,so that they can bringnthe perpetrators to justice. 
 Camfed, another charitynbased out of the UK --,Camfed pays girls' familiesnto keep them in school.,They understand this is the mostnsignificant intervention they can make.,They used to track the disbursements,nthe attendance, the grades, on paper.,The turnaround time between a teachernwriting down grades or attendance,and getting that into a reportnwas about two to three years.,Now it's real time.,And because this is such a low-costnsystem and based in the cloud,,it costs, for the entire five countriesnthat Camfed runs this in,,with tens of thousands of girls,,the whole cost combinednis 10,000 dollars a year.,That's less than I used to get,just traveling out for two weeksnto do a consultation. 
 So I told you before that whennwe were doing it the old-fashioned way,,I realized all of our work was reallynadding up to just a drop in the bucket --,10, 20, 30 different programs.,We've made a lot of progress,,but I recognize that right now,,even the work that we've donenwith 14,000 people using this,is still a drop in the bucket. 
 But something's changed,nand I think it should be obvious.,What's changed now is,,instead of having a programnin which we're scaling at such a slow rate,that we can never reachnall the people who need us,,we've made it unnecessarynfor people to get reached by us.,We've created a toolnthat lets programs keep kids in school,,track the number of babies that are bornnand the number of babies that die,,catch criminals and successfullynprosecute them --,to do all these different thingsnto learn more about what's going on,,to understand more,,to see more ...,and to save lives and improve lives. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary,of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.,I mean, nine years is a long time.,And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,,I think what that means,is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.,(Laughter),But not all, a few are still alive.,Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.,And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.,I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.,For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,,as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff. 
 And I can't complain about this.,I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,,although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.,If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,,it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.,(Laughter),And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.,But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.,I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad,with whatever great fact I had just read about --,Haley's comet or giant squids,or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.,I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.,And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.,(Laughter) 
 And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.,I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979,because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,,that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud.",I was going to miss my game shows.,And later, in the mid-'80s,,when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,,I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.,It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.,And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,,where there was only one English language TV channel.,There was Armed Forces TV,,and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.,So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy." 
 I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.,I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s,and holding my own, back when that was a fad.,There's a weird sense of mastery you get,when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.,You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.,And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --,the right fact deployed at exactly the right place. 
 I never had a guidance counselor,who thought this was a legitimate career path,,that thought you could major in trivia,or be a professional ex-game show contestant.,And so I sold out way too young.,I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.,I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,,and I became a computer programmer --,not an especially good one,,not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.,But that's what I was doing. 
 And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --,a few years later, I think 2009 or so,,when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,,"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us,they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.',Are you up for this?",This was the first I'd heard of it.,And of course I said yes, for several reasons.,One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.,It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.,(Laughter),And I would do it for nothing.,I don't think they know that, luckily,,but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.,I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.,And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.,People playing computers on game shows,was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,,and now I could be on the stage with it.,I was not going to say no. 
 The third reason I said yes,is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.,I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.,I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy.",People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program,that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English,and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,,unpack the meaning of the clue.,The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,,very hard for a computer.,And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.,Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.,(Laughter) 
 But as the years went on,,as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,,I started to get occasional updates from them,,and I started to get a little more worried.,I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.,It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,",tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top,with their performance plotted on number of --,I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,,clues responded to --,versus the accuracy of those answers.,So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.,And at first, it was very low.,There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.,But then you see the line start to go up.,And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.,And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart,some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.,And thought, what are these?,"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings.",And I saw this line coming for me.,And I realized, this is it.,This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.,(Laughter),It's not the Terminator's gun sight;,it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,,the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at. 
 And when the game eventually happened about a year later,,it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.,We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.,Watson does not travel.,Watson's actually huge.,It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,,trillions of bytes of memory.,We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.,The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.,And so Watson does not travel.,You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage. 
 So me and the other human player,wound up at this secret IBM research lab,in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County,to play the computer.,And we realized right away,that the computer had a big home court advantage.,There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.,Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,,and there's the thing in the middle of their court.,And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers,cheering on their little darling,,having poured millions of dollars into this,hoping against hope that the humans screw up,,and holding up "Go Watson" signs,and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.,I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.,If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,,it's an unpleasant sight. 
 But they were right. They were exactly right.,I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,,but Watson won handily.,And I remember standing there behind the podium,as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.,It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.,And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.,And I remember thinking, this is it.,I felt obsolete.,I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s,seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.,I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete,under this new regime of thinking computers.,And it hasn't been the last. 
 If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --,and I see this all the time --,that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically,without actually needing a human pharmacist.,And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals,because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.,You don't need human assistants for that anymore.,I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score,from a baseball or football game,and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game,and was commenting on it.,And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job,as the humans they're replacing,,but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.,So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.,I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,,we'll enter a new golden age of leisure,when we'll all have time for the things we really love,because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.,I've heard other people say quite the opposite,,that this is yet another tier of the middle class,that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology,and that this is actually something ominous,,something that we should worry about. 
 I'm not an economist myself.,All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.,And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.,Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,,and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people,and thousands of processors working in parallel,and they could do the same thing.,They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,,and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore.",And it made me think, what does this mean,,if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,,not just lower unimportant brain functions.,I'm sure many of you remember a distant time,when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.,And suddenly there was a machine that did that,,and now we don't need to remember that anymore.,I have read that there's now actually evidence,that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,,physically shrinks and atrophies,in people who use tools like GPS,,because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.,We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.,And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff,gets smaller and dumber.,And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better,at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?,Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?,Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?,As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,,this was a terrifying idea to me. 
 The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.,The things we know are still important.,I came to believe there were two advantages,that those of us who have these things in our head have,over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second.",There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time. 
 The advantage of volume, first,,just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.,There's so much information out there.,Being a Renaissance man or woman,,that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.,Now it's really not possible,to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.,There's just too much.,They say that the scope of human information,is now doubling every 18 months or so,,the sum total of human information.,That means between now and late 2014,,we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,,as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.,It's doubling every 18 months now.,This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make,require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.,A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?,Who do I vote for?,Do I take this job or that one?,These are the decisions that require correct judgments,about many different kinds of facts.,If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,,we're going to be able to make informed decisions.,If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,,we may be in trouble.,According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,,somewhere along the lines of 80 percent,of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy,cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.,If you can't do that first step,,are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know,to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?,Quite probably not.,At some point you're just going to be like,,"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it.",And you'll make a less informed decision. 
 The other issue is the advantage of time that you have,if you have all these things at your fingertips.,I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.,She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England,on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.,She runs up to them on the beach one morning,and says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach.",And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here.",And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,,he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea,and you see the waves churning way out there,,that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach.",What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?,Her parents thought about it,,and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.,They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,,and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,,because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,,the day after Christmas, 2004,,that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.,But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,,because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before. 
 Now when facts come in handy like that --,I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,,one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --,normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.,But in this case it happened in real life.,And it happens in real life all the time.,It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.,It's a meeting or job interview or first date,or some relationship that gets lubricated,because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.,You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah.",Or your alma mater or your job,,and I know just a little something about it,,enough to get the ball rolling.,People love that shared connection that gets created,when somebody knows something about you.,It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.,That's often the advantage of time.,And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.,You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.,Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo.",That doesn't work. That's just annoying.,(Laughter) 
 The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,,Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it.",And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.,I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good,,that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads,are what make us who we are,,as individuals and as a species.,I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.,I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced,by these little bubbles of specialty,,so that none of us know about the common associations,that used to bind our civilization together.,I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all,sitting on a mountain somewhere,,reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes,and the lyrics of Abba songs.,I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share,and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,,to our search engines and our smartphones. 
 In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,,things don't always end well.,Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.,It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001.",Things always go terribly wrong.,And I feel like we're sort of at the point now,where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.,This is a question of leadership,,because it becomes a question of who leads the future.,On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age,where information is more universally available,than it's ever been in human history,,where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.,And on the other hand,,we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia,where the machines have taken over,and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,,that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,,and why would we ever bother learning anything new. 
 Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.,And we can all make that choice.,We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,,who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,,I don't have to learn anymore,",or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.,I don't have to learn new things anymore.",No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.,We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.,That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.,These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants,sitting at home memorizing the phone book.,I've met a lot of them.,For the most part, they are just normal folks,who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,,thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject. 
 We can live in one of these two worlds.,We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,,continue to be the thing that makes us special,,or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.,Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours. 
 Thank you very much.So here's the good news about families.,The last 50 years have seen a revolution,in what it means to be a family.,We have blended families, adopted families,,we have nuclear families living in separate houses,and divorced families living in the same house.,But through it all, the family has grown stronger.,Eight in 10 say the family they have today,is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in. 
 Now, here's the bad news.,Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed,by the chaos of family life.,Every parent I know, myself included,,feels like we're constantly playing defense.,Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.,Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,,they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying. 
 And here's the worst news of all.,Our children sense we're out of control.,Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute,asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted,one wish about your parents, what would it be?",The parents predicted the kids would say,,spending more time with them.,They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?,That their parents be less tired and less stressed. 
 So how can we change this dynamic?,Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,,draw our family closer,,and generally prepare our children to enter the world? 
 I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,,traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,,experts ranging from elite peace negotiators,to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.,I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right,and what can I learn from them to make my family happier? 
 I want to tell you about one family that I met,,and why I think they offer clues.,At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,,where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down,to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.,The Starrs are a regular American family,with their share of regular American family problems.,David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care,of their four children, ages 10 to 15.,One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.,One has lacrosse on the near side of town.,One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD. 
 "We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said. 
 What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.,Instead of turning to friends or relatives,,they looked to David's workplace.,They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development,that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan,to startups in Silicon Valley.,In agile, workers are organized into small groups,and do things in very short spans of time.,So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,,the team in effect manages itself.,You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.,You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.,David said when they brought this system into their home,,the family meetings in particular increased communication,,decreased stress, and made everybody,happier to be part of the family team.,When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques,into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,,it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.,And these meetings had this effect,while taking under 20 minutes. 
 So what is Agile, and why can it help,with something that seems so different, like families?,In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist,at a financial firm in New England.,He was very frustrated with how software got designed.,Companies followed the waterfall method, right,,in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down,to programmers below,,and no one had ever consulted the programmers.,Eighty-three percent of projects failed.,They were too bloated or too out of date,by the time they were done.,Sutherland wanted to create a system where,ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom,and be adjusted in real time.,He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review,before stumbling upon an article in 1986,called "The New New Product Development Game.",It said that the pace of business was quickening --,and by the way, this was in 1986 --,and the most successful companies were flexible.,It highlighted Toyota and Canon,and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.,As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,,and said, "That's it.",In Sutherland's system, companies don't use,large, massive projects that take two years.,They do things in small chunks.,Nothing takes longer than two weeks.,So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker,and come back with a cell phone or a social network,",you say, "You go off and come up with one element,,then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt.",You succeed or fail quickly.,Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,,and it's sweeping into management suites.,Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques,and applying it to their families.,You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.,Even the Sutherlands told me that they had,an Agile Thanksgiving,,where you had one group of people working on the food,,one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.,Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever. 
 So let's take one problem that families face,,crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.,A key plank is accountability,,so teams use information radiators,,these large boards in which everybody is accountable.,So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,,created a morning checklist,in which each child is expected to tick off chores.,So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,,poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,,and she sat there,,kind of amiably talking to each of her children,as one after the other they came downstairs,,checked the list, made themselves breakfast,,checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,,rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,,checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,,and made their way to the bus.,It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen. 
 And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house, 
 our kids needed way too much monitoring, 
 Eleanor looked at me. 
 "That's what I thought," she said.,"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.',But I was wrong." 
 So I turned to David: "So why does it work?" 
 He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this.",And he made a checkmark.,He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.,With kids, it's heaven." 
 The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,,it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter),But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.,So following the agile model, we ask three questions:,What worked well in our family this week,,what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?,Everyone throws out suggestions,and then we pick two to focus on.,And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.,What worked well this week?,Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.,What didn't work well? Our math sheets,,or greeting visitors at the door.,Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.,Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,,I mean at least not that are revealing.,This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.,But the most surprising part was when we turned to,,what are we going to work on in the week ahead?,You know, the key idea of agile is that,teams essentially manage themselves,,and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.,Our kids love this process.,So they would come up with all these ideas.,You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,,get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.,Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.,It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.,We constantly have to kind of dial them back.,Now look, naturally there's a gap between,their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,,but the truth is it didn't really bother us.,It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables,that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come. 
 Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --,We're still holding these meetings.,My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom. 
 So what did we learn?,The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001,when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers,met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.,I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.,I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.,I'm proposing three planks. 
 Plank number one: Adapt all the time. 
 When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?,We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.,That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.,We can't. What's great about the agile system,is you build in a system of change,so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.,It's like they say in the Internet world:,if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,,you're doing the wrong thing.,Parents can learn a lot from that.,But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.,We have to break parents out of this straitjacket,that the only ideas we can try at home,are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus,or other family experts.,The truth is, their ideas are stale,,whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas,to make groups and teams work effectively. 
 Let's just take a few examples.,Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.,Everybody knows that having family dinner,with your children is good for the kids.,But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.,I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,,"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.,I'm not home, can't make family dinner?,We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.,We'll make Sunday meals more important.",And the truth is, recent research backs him up.,It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time,in any family meal.,The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup.",You can take that 10 minutes and move it,to any part of the day and have the same benefit.,So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability. 
 An environmental psychologist told me,,"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,,you'll be more rigid.,If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open.",She told me, "When you're discipling your children,,sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.,The conversation will go better.",My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations,because I was sitting above in the power position.,So move where you sit. That's adaptability. 
 The point is there are all these new ideas out there.,We've got to hook them up with parents.,So plank number one: Adapt all the time.,Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win. 
 Plank number two: Empower your children.,Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.,It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.,There's a reason that few systems have been more,waterfall over time than the family.,But the single biggest lesson we learned,is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.,Enlist the children in their own upbringing.,Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,,and we had voted to work on overreacting.,So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?",So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.,So we kind of liked that.,But then her sister started working the system.,She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction,or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?",I loved that. Spend the time however you want.,Now give us a punishment. Okay.,If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.,Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.,So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.,There's plenty of parental authority going on.,But we're giving them practice becoming independent,,which of course is our ultimate goal.,Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,,one of my daughters started screaming.,The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!",and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.,To me that is a certified agile miracle.,(Laughter) (Applause),And by the way, research backs this up too.,Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,,evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex,and take more control over their lives.,The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,,and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.,I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,,and he was chiding me for not letting my children,make mistakes with their allowance.,And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?",He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch,with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary,or a $6 million inheritance.",So the bottom line is, empower your children. 
 Plank number three: Tell your story.,Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.,Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,",told me that successful human organizations of any kind,have two things in common:,they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.,So agile is great for stimulating progress,,but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.,So how do you do that?,Collins coached us on doing something,that businesses do, which is define your mission,and identify your core values.,So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.,We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.,We had a pajama party.,I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.,My wife bought a flip chart.,And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?,What values do we most uphold?,And we ended up with 10 statements.,We are travelers, not tourists.,We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.,Again, research shows that parents should spend less time,worrying about what they do wrong,and more time focusing on what they do right,,worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.,This family mission statement is a great way to identify,what it is that you do right. 
 A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.,One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.,And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?,And we didn't really know what to do,,so we called her into my office.,The family mission statement was on the wall,,and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?",And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,,"Bring people together?",Suddenly we had a way into the conversation. 
 Another great way to tell your story,is to tell your children where they came from.,Researchers at Emory gave children a simple,"what do you know" test.,Do you know where your grandparents were born?,Do you know where your parents went to high school?,Do you know anybody in your family,who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?,The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale,had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.,The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor,of emotional health and happiness.,As the author of the study told me,,children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative,have greater self-confidence.,So my final plank is, tell your story.,Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments,and how you overcame the negative ones.,If you give children this happy narrative,,you give them the tools to make themselves happier. 
 I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina",and its famous opening sentence,,"All happy families are alike.,Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.",When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.,Of course all happy families aren't alike.",But as I began working on this project,,I began changing my mind.,Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,,to identify the building blocks,that successful families have.,I've mentioned just three here today:,Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.,Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?,The answer, I believe, is yes.,When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,,his brother Nikolay came to him,and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness,on a little green stick, which he had hidden,in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.,If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.,Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.,In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.,He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.,That story perfectly captures for me,the final lesson that I learned:,Happiness is not something we find,,it's something we make.,Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations,has come to pretty much the same conclusion.,Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.,It's a matter of choice.,You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.,You just need to take small steps,,accumulate small wins,,keep reaching for that green stick.,In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.,What's the secret to a happy family? Try. 
 (Applause)So, why does good sex so often fade,,even for couples who continuento love each other as much as ever?,And why does good intimacynnot guarantee good sex,,contrary to popular belief?,Or, the next question would be,,can we want what we already have?,That's the million-dollar question, right?,And why is the forbidden so erotic?,What is it about transgressionnthat makes desire so potent?,And why does sex make babies,,and babies spell eroticndisaster in couples? 
 (Laughter) 
 It's kind of the fatalnerotic blow, isn't it?,And when you love, how does it feel?,And when you desire, how is it different? 
 These are some of the questions,that are at the center of my explorationnon the nature of erotic desire,and its concomitantndilemmas in modern love.,So I travel the globe,,and what I'm noticing is that everywherenwhere romanticism has entered,,there seems to be a crisis of desire.,A crisis of desire,nas in owning the wanting --,desire as an expressionnof our individuality,,of our free choice,nof our preferences, of our identity --,desire that has become a central concept,as part of modern lovenand individualistic societies. 
 You know, this is the first timenin the history of humankind,where we are trying to experiencensexuality in the long term,not because we want 14 children,,for which we need to have even morenbecause many of them won't make it,,and not because it is exclusivelyna woman's marital duty.,This is the first timenthat we want sex over time,about pleasure and connectionnthat is rooted in desire. 
 So what sustains desire,nand why is it so difficult?,And at the heart of sustainingndesire in a committed relationship,,I think, is the reconciliationnof two fundamental human needs.,On the one hand, our neednfor security, for predictability,,for safety, for dependability,,for reliability, for permanence.,All these anchoring,ngrounding experiences of our lives,that we call home.,But we also have an equallynstrong need -- men and women --,for adventure, for novelty,,for mystery, for risk, for danger,,for the unknown,nfor the unexpected, surprise --,you get the gist.,For journey, for travel. 
 So reconciling our need for securitynand our need for adventure,into one relationship,,or what we today like to callna passionate marriage,,used to be a contradiction in terms.,Marriage was an economic institution,in which you werengiven a partnership for life,in terms of children and social status,and succession and companionship.,But now we want our partnernto still give us all these things,,but in addition I want younto be my best friend,and my trusted confidantnand my passionate lover to boot,,and we live twice as long. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we come to one person,nand we basically are asking them,to give us what oncenan entire village used to provide.,Give me belonging, give me identity,,give me continuity,,but give me transcendencenand mystery and awe all in one.,Give me comfort, give me edge.,Give me novelty, give me familiarity.,Give me predictability, give me surprise.,And we think it's a given,,and toys and lingerienare going to save us with that. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So now we get to the existentialnreality of the story, right?,Because I think, in some way --,and I'll come back to that --,but the crisis of desirenis often a crisis of the imagination. 
 So why does good sex so often fade?,What is the relationshipnbetween love and desire?,How do they relate,nand how do they conflict?,Because therein liesnthe mystery of eroticism. 
 So if there is a verb, for me,nthat comes with love, it's "to have.",And if there is a verb that comesnwith desire, it is "to want.",In love, we want to have,nwe want to know the beloved.,We want to minimize the distance.,We want to contract that gap.,We want to neutralize the tensions.,We want closeness.,But in desire,,we tend to not really want to go backnto the places we've already gone.,Forgone conclusionndoes not keep our interest.,In desire, we want an Other,,somebody on the other sidenthat we can go visit,,that we can go spend some time with,,that we can go see what goes onnin their red-light district.,You know?,In desire, we want a bridge to cross.,Or in other words,nI sometimes say, fire needs air.,Desire needs space.,And when it's said like that,nit's often quite abstract. 
 But then I took a question with me.,And I've gone to more than 20 countriesnin the last few years,with "Mating in Captivity,"nand I asked people,,when do you find yourselfnmost drawn to your partner?,Not attracted sexually,nper Se, but most drawn.,And across culture, across religion,nand across gender -- except for one --,there are a few answersnthat just keep coming back. 
 So the first group is:,I am most drawn to my partnernwhen she is away,,when we are apart, when we reunite.,Basically, when I get back in touch,with my ability to imagine myselfnwith my partner,,when my imagination comesnback in the picture,,and when I can root itnin absence and in longing,,which is a major component of desire. 
 But then the second groupnis even more interesting.,I am most drawn to my partner,when I see him in the studio,,when she is onstage,,when he is in his element,,when she's doing somethingnshe's passionate about,,when I see him at a partynand other people are really drawn to him,,when I see her hold court.,Basically, when I look at my partnernradiant and confident.,Probably the biggestnturn-on across the board.,Radiant, as in self-sustaining.,I look at this person --nby the way, in desire,people rarely talk about it,nwhen we are blended into one,,five centimeters from each other.,I don't know in inches how much that is. 
 But it's also not when the other personnis that far apart,that you no longer see them.,It's when I'm looking at my partnernfrom a comfortable distance,,where this person that is alreadynso familiar, so known,,is momentarily once againnsomewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.,And in this space between menand the other lies the erotic élan,,lies that movement toward the other.,Because sometimes, as Proust says,,mystery is notnabout traveling to new places,,but it's about looking with new eyes.,And so, when I see my partnernon his own or her own,,doing somethingnin which they are enveloped,,I look at this person and I momentarilynget a shift in perception,,and I stay open to the mysteriesnthat are living right next to me. 
 And then, more importantly,nin this description about the other,or myself -- it's the same --,what is most interestingnis that there is no neediness in desire.,Nobody needs anybody.,There is no caretaking in desire.,Caretaking is mightily loving.,It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have yet to see somebodynwho is so turned on,by somebody who needs them.,Wanting them is one thing.,Needing them is a shot down,and women have known that forever,,because anythingnthat will bring up parenthood,will usually decrease the erotic charge. 
 (Laughter) 
 For good reasons, right? 
 And then the third groupnof answers usually would be:,when I'm surprised,nwhen we laugh together,,as somebody said to menin the office today,,when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,,it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.,But basically it's when there is novelty.,But novelty isn't about new positions.,It isn't a repertoire of techniques.,Novelty is, what partsnof you do you bring out?,What parts of you are just being seen? 
 Because in some way one could saynsex isn't something you do, eh?,Sex is a place you go.,It's a space you enter,inside yourselfnand with another, or others.,So where do you go in sex?,What parts of you do you connect to?,What do you seek to express there?,Is it a place for transcendencenand spiritual union?,Is it a place for naughtinessnand is it a place to be safely aggressive?,Is it a place where youncan finally surrender,and not have to takenresponsibility for everything?,Is it a place where you cannexpress your infantile wishes?,What comes out there? It's a language.,It isn't just a behavior.,And it's the poetic of that languagenthat I'm interested in,,which is why I began to explorenthis concept of erotic intelligence. 
 You know, animals have sex.,It's the pivot, it's biology,nit's the natural instinct.,We are the only onesnwho have an erotic life,,which means that it's sexualityntransformed by the human imagination.,We are the only onesnwho can make love for hours,,have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,,and touch nobody,njust because we can imagine it.,We can hint at it.nWe don't even have to do it.,We can experience that powerfulnthing called anticipation,,which is a mortar to desire.,The ability to imagine it,nas if it's happening,,to experience it as if it's happening,,while nothing is happening,and everything is happening,nat the same time. 
 So when I began to think about eroticism,,I began to think about the poetics of sex.,And if I look at it as an intelligence,,then it's something that you cultivate.,What are the ingredients?,Imagination, playfulness,,novelty, curiosity, mystery.,But the central agent is reallynthat piece called the imagination. 
 But more importantly,nfor me to begin to understand,who are the couplesnwho have an erotic spark,,what sustains desire,,I had to go backnto the original definition of eroticism,,the mystical definition,,and I went through itnthrough a bifurcation,by looking, actually, at trauma,,which is the other side.,And I looked at it,,looking at the communitynthat I had grown up in,,which was a community in Belgium,nall Holocaust survivors,,and in my community,nthere were two groups:,those who didn't die,nand those who came back to life.,And those who didn't die livednoften very tethered to the ground,,could not experiencenpleasure, could not trust,,because when you're vigilant,nworried, anxious, and insecure,,you can't lift your headnto go and take off in space,and be playful and safe and imaginative.,Those who came back to life,were those who understoodnthe erotic as an antidote to death.,They knew how to keep themselves alive.,And when I began to listen,to the sexlessnessnof the couples that I work with,,I sometimes would hear peoplensay, "I want more sex,",but generally, people want better sex,,and better is to reconnectnwith that quality of aliveness,,of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,,of Eros, of energy,that sex used to afford them,,or that they've hopednit would afford them. 
 And so I began to askna different question.,"I shut myself off when ..."nbegan to be the question.,"I turn off my desires when ...",Which is not the same question as,,"What turns me off is ..."nand "You turn me off when ...",And people began to say,n"I turn myself off when,I feel dead inside,nwhen I don't like my body,,when I feel old,,when I haven't had time for myself,,when I haven't had a chancento even check in with you,,when I don't perform well at work,,when I feel low self esteem,,when I don't have a sense of self-worth,,when I don't feel like I havena right to want, to take,,to receive pleasure." 
 And then I began to asknthe reverse question.,"I turn myself on when ...",Because most of the time,npeople like to ask the question,,"You turn me on, what turns me on,",and I'm out of the question, you know?,Now, if you are dead inside,,the other person can dona lot of things for Valentine's.,It won't make a dent.nThere is nobody at the reception desk. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I turn myself on when,,I turn on my desires, I wake up when ... 
 Now, in this paradoxnbetween love and desire,,what seems to be so puzzling,is that the very ingredientsnthat nurture love --,mutuality, reciprocity,,protection, worry,nresponsibility for the other --,are sometimes the very ingredientsnthat stifle desire.,Because desire comesnwith a host of feelings,that are not alwaysnsuch favorites of love:,jealousy, possessiveness,,aggression, power, dominance,,naughtiness, mischief.,Basically most of us will get turned onnat night by the very same things,that we will demonstratenagainst during the day.,You know, the erotic mindnis not very politically correct.,If everybody was fantasizingnon a bed of roses,,we wouldn't be having suchninteresting talks about this. 
 (Laughter) 
 But no, in our mind up therenare a host of things going on,that we don't always knownhow to bring to the person that we love,,because we think lovencomes with selflessness,and in fact desire comesnwith a certain amount of selfishness,in the best sense of the word:,the ability to stay connectednto one's self in the presence of another. 
 So I want to drawnthat little image for you,,because this need to reconcilenthese two sets of needs,,we are born with that.,Our need for connection,nour need for separateness,,or our need for security and adventure,,or our need for togethernessnand for autonomy,,and if you think about the little kidnwho sits on your lap,and who is cozily nested herenand very secure and comfortable,,and at some point all of usnneed to go out into the world,to discover and to explore.,That's the beginning of desire,,that exploratory need,ncuriosity, discovery.,And then at some point they turnnaround and they look at you.,And if you tell them,,"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.,Go for it. There's so much fun out there,",then they can turn awaynand they can experience,connection and separatenessnat the same time.,They can go off in their imagination,noff in their body,,off in their playfulness,,all the while knowing that there'snsomebody when they come back. 
 But if on this sidenthere is somebody who says,,"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.,My partner hasn't taken carenof me in so long.,What's so good out there?,Don't we have everythingnyou need together, you and I?",then there are a few little reactions,that all of us can pretty much recognize.,Some of us will come back,,came back a long time ago,,and that little child who comes back,is the child who will forgona part of himself,in order not to lose the other.,I will lose my freedomnin order not to lose connection.,And I will learn to love in a certain way,that will become burdened with extra worry,and extra responsibilitynand extra protection,,and I won't know how to leave you,in order to go play,nin order to go experience pleasure,,in order to discover,nto enter inside myself. 
 Translate this into adult language.,It starts very young.,It continues into our sex livesnup to the end.,Child number two comes back,but looks like thatnover their shoulder all the time.,"Are you going to be there?,Are you going to curse me, scold me?,Are you going to be angry with me?",And they may be gone,nbut they're never really away.,And those are often the peoplenthat will tell you,,"In the beginning, it was super hot.",Because in the beginning,,the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong,that it actually lednto the decrease of desire.,The more connected I became,nthe more responsible I felt,,the less I was able to let gonin your presence.,The third child doesn't really come back. 
 So what happens,nif you want to sustain desire,,it's that real dialectic piece.,On the one hand you want the securitynin order to be able to go.,On the other hand if you can't go,nyou can't have pleasure,,you can't culminate,nyou don't have an orgasm,,you don't get excitednbecause you spend your time,in the body and the headnof the other and not in your own. 
 So in this dilemma about reconcilingnthese two sets of fundamental needs,,there are a few things that I've comento understand erotic couples do.,One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.,They understandnthat there is an erotic space,that belongs to each of them.,They also understandnthat foreplay is not something you do,five minutes before the real thing.,Foreplay pretty much startsnat the end of the previous orgasm.,They also understandnthat an erotic space isn't about,,you begin to stroke the other.,It's about you create a spacenwhere you leave Management Inc.,,maybe where you leave the Agile program -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And you actually just enter that placenwhere you stop being the good citizen,who is taking care of thingsnand being responsible. 
 Responsibility and desire just butt heads.,They don't really do well together.,Erotic couples also understandnthat passion waxes and wanes.,It's pretty much like the moon.,It has intermittent eclipses.,But what they knownis they know how to resurrect it.,They know how to bring it back.,And they know how to bring it back,because they havendemystified one big myth,,which is the myth of spontaneity,,which is that it's just goingnto fall from heaven,while you're folding the laundrynlike a deus ex machina,,and in fact they understood,that whatever is going to just happennin a long-term relationship, already has. 
 Committed sex is premeditated sex.,It's willful. It's intentional.,It's focus and presence. 
 Merry Valentine's. 
 (Applause)My name is Dan Cohennand I am an academic, as he said.,And what that means is that I argue.,It's an important part of my life.,And I like to argue.,And I'm not just an academic,nI'm a philosopher,,so I like to think that I'm actuallynpretty good at arguing. 
 But I also like to thinkna lot about arguing.,And in thinking about arguing,nI've come across some puzzles.,And one of the puzzles is that,,as I've been thinkingnabout arguing over the years --,and it's been decades now --,I've gotten better at arguing.,But the more that I arguenand the better I get at arguing,,the more that I lose.,And that's a puzzle. 
 And the other puzzlenis that I'm actually okay with that.,Why is it that I'm okay with losing,and why is it that I think good arguersnare actually better at losing?,Well, there are some other puzzles.,One is: why do we argue?,Who benefits from arguments?,When I think about arguments,nI'm talking about --,let's call them academic argumentsnor cognitive arguments --,where something cognitive is at stake:,Is this proposition true?nIs this theory a good theory?,Is this a viable interpretationnof the data or the text? And so on.,I'm not interested really in argumentsnabout whose turn it is to do the dishes,or who has to take out the garbage.,Yeah, we have those arguments, too.,I tend to win those arguments,nbecause I know the tricks.,But those aren't the important arguments.,I'm interested in academic arguments,,and here are the things that puzzle me. 
 First, what do good arguers winnwhen they win an argument?,What do I win if I convince you,that utilitarianism isn't reallynthe right framework,for thinking about ethical theories?,What do we win when we win an argument?,Even before that,,what does it matter to me,whether you have this ideanthat Kant's theory works,or Mill is the right ethicist to follow?,It's no skin off my back,whether you think functionalismnis a viable theory of mind.,So why do we even try to argue?,Why do we try to convince other people,to believe thingsnthey don't want to believe,,and is that even a nice thing to do?,Is that a nice way to treatnanother human being,,try and make them think somethingnthey don't want to think?,Well, my answer is going to make referencento three models for arguments. 
 The first model -- let's call itnthe dialectical model --,is we think of arguments as war;nyou know what that's like --,a lot of screaming and shoutingnand winning and losing.,That's not a very helpfulnmodel for arguing,,but it's a pretty commonnand entrenched model for arguing. 
 But there's a second model for arguing:narguments as proofs.,Think of a mathematician's argument.,Here's my argument.nDoes it work? Is it any good?,Are the premises warranted?nAre the inferences valid?,Does the conclusion follownfrom the premises?,No opposition, no adversariality --,not necessarily any arguingnin the adversarial sense. 
 But there's a third model to keep in mind,that I think is going to be very helpful,,and that is arguments as performances,narguments in front of an audience.,We can think of a politicianntrying to present a position,,trying to convincenthe audience of something. 
 But there's another twist on this modelnthat I really think is important;,namely, that when we arguenbefore an audience,,sometimes the audience hasna more participatory role in the argument;,that is, arguments are alson[performances] in front of juries,,who make a judgment and decide the case.,Let's call this the rhetorical model,,where you have to tailor your argumentnto the audience at hand.,You know, presenting a sound, well-argued,,tight argument in Englishnbefore a francophone audience,just isn't going to work. 
 So we have these models --nargument as war, argument as proof,and argument as performance.,Of those three, the argument as warnis the dominant one.,It dominates how we talk about arguments,,it dominates how we think about arguments,,and because of that,nit shapes how we argue,,our actual conduct in arguments.,Now, when we talk about arguments,,we talk in a very militaristic language.,We want strong arguments,narguments that have a lot of punch,,arguments that are right on target.,We want to have our defenses upnand our strategies all in order.,We want killer arguments.,That's the kind of argument we want.,It is the dominant waynof thinking about arguments.,When I'm talking about arguments,,that's probably what you thought of,nthe adversarial model. 
 But the war metaphor,,the war paradigm or modelnfor thinking about arguments,,has, I think, deforming effectsnon how we argue.,First, it elevates tactics over substance.,You can take a classnin logic, argumentation.,You learn all about the subterfuges,that people use to try and winnarguments -- the false steps.,It magnifies the us-versusnthem aspect of it.,It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.,And the only foreseeable outcomesnare triumph -- glorious triumph --,or abject, ignominious defeat.,I think those are deforming effects,,and worst of all, it seemsnto prevent things like negotiation,or deliberation or compromisenor collaboration. 
 Think about that one -- have younever entered an argument thinking,,"Let's see if we can hash something out,nrather than fight it out.,What can we work out together?",I think the argument-as-war metaphor,inhibits those other kindsnof resolutions to argumentation. 
 And finally -- this is reallynthe worst thing --,arguments don't seem to get usnanywhere; they're dead ends.,They are like roundabouts or traffic jamsnor gridlock in conversation.,We don't get anywhere.,And one more thing.,And as an educator, this is the onenthat really bothers me:,If argument is war,,then there's an implicit equationnof learning with losing. 
 And let me explain what I mean.,Suppose you and I have an argument.,You believe a proposition, P, and I don't.,And I say, "Well, why do you believe P?",And you give me your reasons.,And I object and say,n"Well, what about ...?",And you answer my objection.,And I have a question:n"Well, what do you mean?,How does it apply over here?",And you answer my question.,Now, suppose at the end of the day,,I've objected, I've questioned,,I've raised all sorts of counterncounter-considerations,and in every case you've respondednto my satisfaction.,And so at the end of the day, I say,,"You know what? I guess you're right: P.",So, I have a new belief.,And it's not just any belief;,it's well-articulated, examined --nit's a battle-tested belief. 
 Great cognitive gain.,OK, who won that argument?,Well, the war metaphornseems to force us into saying you won,,even though I'm the only onenwho made any cognitive gain.,What did you gain, cognitively,nfrom convincing me?,Sure, you got some pleasure out of it,nmaybe your ego stroked,,maybe you get some professional status,in the field --n"This guy's a good arguer.",But just from a cognitive point of view,,who was the winner?,The war metaphor forces us into thinkingnthat you're the winner and I lost,,even though I gained.,And there's something wrongnwith that picture.,And that's the picturenI really want to change if we can. 
 So, how can we find ways,to make argumentsnyield something positive?,What we need is newnexit strategies for arguments.,But we're not going to havennew exit strategies for arguments,until we have new entrynapproaches to arguments.,We need to thinknof new kinds of arguments.,In order to do that, well --,I don't know how to do that.,That's the bad news.,The argument-as-war metaphornis just ... it's a monster.,It's just taken up habitation in our mind,,and there's no magic bulletnthat's going to kill it.,There's no magic wandnthat's going to make it disappear.,I don't have an answer. 
 But I have some suggestions.,Here's my suggestion:,If we want to thinknof new kinds of arguments,,what we need to donis think of new kinds of arguers. 
 So try this:,Think of all the rolesnthat people play in arguments.,There's the proponent and the opponent,in an adversarial, dialectical argument.,There's the audiencenin rhetorical arguments.,There's the reasonernin arguments as proofs.,All these different roles.,Now, can you imagine an argumentnin which you are the arguer,,but you're also in the audience,nwatching yourself argue?,Can you imagine yourselfnwatching yourself argue,,losing the argument, and yet still,nat the end of the argument, saying,,"Wow, that was a good argument!",Can you do that?,I think you can, and I thinknif you can imagine that kind of argument,,where the loser says to the winnernand the audience and the jury can say,,"Yeah, that was a good argument,",then you have imagined a good argument.,And more than that,,I think you've imagined a good arguer,,an arguer that's worthy of the kindnof arguer you should try to be. 
 Now, I lose a lot of arguments.,It takes practice to become a good arguer,,in the sense of being able to benefitnfrom losing, but fortunately,,I've had many, many colleaguesnwho have been willing to step up,and provide that practice for me. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Aquatic noises) 
 So this video was taken,at Aquarius undersea laboratory,four miles off the coast of Key Largo,,about 60 feet below the surface.,NASA uses this extreme environment,to train astronauts and aquanauts,,and last year, they invited us along for the ride.,All the footage was taken from our open ROV,,which is a robot that we built in our garage. 
 So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,,which in our case means our little robot,sends live video,across that ultra-thin tether,back to the computer topside.,It's open source, meaning we publish,and share all of our design files,and all of our code online,,allowing anyone to modify,or improve or change the design.,It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts,and costs about 1,000 times cheaper,than the ROVs James Cameron used,to explore the Titanic.,So ROVs aren't new.,They've been around for decades.,Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.,Oil and gas companies use them for exploration,and construction.,What we've built isn't unique.,It's how we've built it that's really unique. 
 So I want to give you a quick storynof how it got started.,So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I,decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave,in the foothills of the Sierras.,We had heard this story about lost gold,from a Gold Rush-era robbery,nand we wanted to go up there.,Unfortunately, we didn't have any money,and we didn't have any tools to do it.,So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,,but we didn't have all the parts figured out,,so we did what anybody would do in our situation:,we asked the Internet for help.,More specifically, we created this website,,openROV.com, and shared nour intentions and our plans,For the first few months, it was just Eric and I,talking back to each other on the forums,,but pretty soon, we started to get feedback,from makers and hobbyists,,and then actually professional ocean engineers,who had some suggestions for what we should do.,We kept working on it. We learned a lot.,We kept prototyping, and eventually,,we decided we wanted to go nto the cave. We were ready. 
 So about that time, our little expeditionnbecame quite a story,,and it got picked up in The New York Times.,And we were pretty much just overwhelmed,with interest from people who wanted a kit,that they could build this open ROV themselves. 
 So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,,and when we did,,we raised our funding goal in about two hours,,and all of a sudden, nhad this money to make these kits.,But then we had to learn how to make them.,I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.,So we quickly learned that our garage,was not big enough to hold our growing operation.,But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,,thanks a lot to TechShop,nwhich was a big help to us,,and we shipped these kits all over the world,just before Christmas of last year,,so it was just a few months ago.,But we're already starting to get video,and photos back from all over the world,,including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.,We've also learned the penguins love robots.,(Laughter) 
 So we're still publishing all the designs online,,encouraging anyone to build these themselves.,That's the only way that we could have done this.,By being open source, we've created,this distributed R&D network,,and we're moving faster thannany venture-backed counterpart.,But the actual robot is really only half the story.,The real potential, the long term potential,,is with this community of DIY ocean explorers,that are forming all over the globe.,What can we discover,when there's thousands of these devices,roaming the seas? 
 So you're probably all wondering: the cave.,Did you find the gold?,Well, we didn't find any gold,,but we decided that what we foundnwas much more valuable.,It was the glimpse into a potential future,for ocean exploration.,It's something that's not limited tonthe James Camerons of the world,,but something that we're all participating in.,It's an underwater world,we're all exploring together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I've noticed something interestingnabout society and culture.,Everything risky requires a license.,So, learning to drive,nowning a gun, getting married.,There's a certain -- 
 (Laughter) 
 That's true in everything risky,nexcept technology.,For some reason,nthere's no standard syllabus,,there's no basic course.,They just sort of give you your computernand then kick you out of the nest.,You're supposed to learnnthis stuff -- how?,Just by osmosis.,Nobody ever sits down and tells you,n"This is how it works.",So today I'm going to tell you ten things,that you thought everybody knew,nbut it turns out they don't. 
 First of all, on the web,nif you want to scroll down,,don't pick up the mousenand use the scroll bar.,That's a terrible waste of time.,Do that only if you're paid by the hour.,Instead, hit the space bar.,The space bar scrolls down one page.,Hold down the Shift keynto scroll back up again.,So, space bar to scroll down one page;nworks in every browser,,in every kind of computer. 
 Also on the web, when you're filling innone of these forms like your addresses,,I assume you knownthat you can hit the Tab key,to jump from box to box to box.,But what about the pop-up menunwhere you put in your state?,Don't open the pop-up menu.,That's a terrible waste of calories.,Type the first letter of your statenover and over and over.,So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.,If you want Texas, go T, T,nand you jump right to that thing,without even opening the pop-up menu. 
 Also on the web,nwhen the text is too small,,what you do is hold down the Control keynand hit plus, plus, plus.,You make the text larger with each tap.,Works on every computer,nevery web browser,,or minus, minus, to get smaller again.,If you're on the Mac,nit might be Command instead. 
 When you're typingnon your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,,don't bother switching layoutsnto the punctuation layout,to hit the period and then a space,,then try to capitalize the next letter.,Just hit the space bar twice.,The phone puts the period,nthe space, and the capital for you.,Go space, space.,It is totally amazing. 
 Also when it comesnto cell phones, on all phones,,if you want to redialnsomebody that you've dialed before,,all you have to do is hit the call button,,and it puts the last phone numberninto the box for you,,and at that point you can hitncall again to actually dial it.,No need to go to the recent calls listnif you're trying to call somebody,just hit the call button again. 
 Something that drives me crazy:,When I call you and leave a messagenon your voice mail,,I hear you saying, "Leave a message,",and then I get these 15 secondsnof freaking instructions,,like we haven't hadnanswering machines for 45 years! 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not bitter. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it turns outnthere's a keyboard shortcut,that lets you jump directlynto the beep like this. 
 Phone: At the tone, please... 
 (Beep) 
 David Pogue: Unfortunately,nthe carriers didn't adopt,the same keystroke,nso it's different by carrier,,so it devolves upon younto learn the keystroke,for the person you're calling.,I didn't say these were goingnto be perfect. 
 So most of you think of Google,as something that lets younlook up a web page,,but it is also a dictionary.,Type the word "define"nand the word you want to know.,You don't even have to click anything.,There's the definition as you type.,It's also a complete FAA database.,Type the name of the airlinenand the flight.,It shows you where the flight is,nthe gate, the terminal,,how long until it lands.,You don't need an app.,It's also unit and currency conversion.,Again, you don't have to clicknone of the results.,Just type it into the box,nand there's your answer. 
 While we're talking about text --,When you want to highlight --,this is just an example -- 
 (Laughter) 
 When you want to highlight a word,,please don't waste your lifendragging across it,with the mouse like a newbie.,Double click the word.,Watch "200" -- I go double-click,,it neatly selects just that word.,Also, don't deletenwhat you've highlighted.,You can just type over it.,This is in every program.,Also, you can go double-click, drag,,to highlight in one-wordnincrements as you drag.,Much more precise.,Again, don't bother deleting.,Just type over it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Shutter lag is the timenbetween your pressing the shutter button,and the moment the camera actually snaps.,It's extremely frustratingnon any camera under $1,000. 
 (Camera click) 
 (Laughter) 
 So, that's because the camera needs timento calculate the focus and exposure,,but if you pre-focus with a half-press,,leave your finger down --,no shutter lag!,You get it every time.,I've just turned your $50 cameraninto a $1,000 camera with that trick. 
 And finally, it often happensnthat you're giving a talk,,and for some reason,nthe audience is looking at the slide,instead of at you! 
 (Laughter) 
 So when that happens --nthis works in Keynote, PowerPoint,,it works in every programn-- all you do is hit the letter B key,,B for blackout, to black out the slide,nmake everybody look at you,,and then when you're readynto go on, you hit B again,,and if you're really on a roll,nyou can hit the W key for "whiteout,",and you white out the slide,,and then you can hit W againnto un-blank it. 
 So I know I went super fast.,If you missed anything, I'll be happynto send you the list of these tips.,In the meantime, congratulations.,You all get your CalifornianTechnology License. 
 Have a great day. 
 (Applause)Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems,made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.,Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings,all harbor resident microbial landscapes.,As we design these things, we could be thinking,about designing these invisible worlds,,and also thinking about how they interact,with our personal ecosystems. 
 Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,,and these creatures define who we are.,The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.,The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.,The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,,or not,,and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems,interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.,So, for example, when you touch a pencil,,microbial exchange happens. 
 If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,,this opens a path to influencing,our health in unprecedented ways. 
 I get asked all of the time from people,,"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?",And I believe the answer is yes.,I think we're doing it right now,,but we're doing it unconsciously.,I'm going to share data with you,from one aspect of my research focused on architecture,that demonstrates how, through both conscious,and unconscious design,,we're impacting these invisible worlds. 
 This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,,and I worked with a team of architects and biologists,to sample over 300 rooms in this building.,We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,,and to do this, we sampled dust.,From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,,broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.,This means that people in my group,were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.,This is a picture of Tim, who,,right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,,he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in,I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,,and things have changed dramatically for me." 
 So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,,and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool,that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.,The way that you look at this data is,,first, look around the outside of the circle.,You'll see broad bacterial groups,,and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,,it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.,So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of,alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock,you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. 
 Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.,If you look inside the restrooms,,they all have really similar ecosystems,,and if you were to look inside the classrooms,,those also have similar ecosystems.,But if you look across these space types,,you can see that they're fundamentally different,from one another.,I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.,I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,,it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of.",And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. 
 This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,,because you can bring on principles of ecology,,and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,,the way organisms move around.,We know that microbes are dispersed around by people,and by air.,So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building,was look at the air system.,Mechanical engineers design air handling units,to make sure that people are comfortable,,that the air flow and temperature is just right.,They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,,but they could also be using biology.,If you look at the microbes,in one of the air handling units in this building,,you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.,And if you compare this to the microbes,in a different air handling unit,,you'll see that they're fundamentally different.,The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,,and what that means is that mechanical engineers,are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability,to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. 
 Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,,and designers often cluster rooms together,to facilitate interactions among people,,or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.,Given that microbes travel around with people,,you might expect to see rooms that are close together,have really similar biomes.,And that is exactly what we found.,If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,,they have very similar ecosystems,,but if you go to an office,that is a farther walking distance away,,the ecosystem is fundamentally different.,And when I see the power that dispersal has,on these biogeographic patterns,,it makes me think that it's possible,to tackle really challenging problems,,like hospital-acquired infections.,I believe this has got to be, in part,,a building ecology problem. 
 All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.,I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.,He's an architect,,and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.,He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.,When he met me and realized that it was possible for him,to study in a quantitative way,how his design choices impacted,the ecology and biology of this building,,he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.,He went from thinking just about energy,to also starting to think about human health.,He helped design some of the air handling systems,in this building and the way it was ventilated. 
 So what I'm first going to show you is,air that we sampled outside of the building.,What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities,in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.,Next I'm going to show you what happened,when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.,We blocked them off at night,so that they got no ventilation.,A lot of buildings are operated this way,,probably where you work,,and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.,What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant,until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.,When you walked into those rooms,,they smelled really bad,,and our data suggests that it had something to do with,leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup,from people the day before.,Contrast this to rooms,that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy,where air came in from the outside through louvers.,In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,,and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.,He felt like he had made a good choice,with the design process,because it was both energy efficient,and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. 
 The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,,but they're relevant to the design of anything.,Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want,in a plane,or on a phone. 
 There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.,It's called BLIS, and it's been shown,to both ward off pathogens,and give you good breath.,Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones? 
 A conscious approach to design,,I'm calling it bioinformed design,,and I think it's possible. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is me building a prototype,for six hours straight.,This is slave labor to my own project.,This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.,And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world,with brute-force assembly techniques.,And this is exactly why I started studying,how to program physical materials to build themselves. 
 But there is another world.,Today at the micro- and nanoscales,,there's an unprecedented revolution happening.,And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials,to change shape, change properties,and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.,There's even a software called cadnano,that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes,like nano robots or drug delivery systems,and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures. 
 But if we look at the human scale,,there's massive problems that aren't being addressed,by those nanoscale technologies.,If we look at construction and manufacturing,,there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption,and excessive labor techniques.,In infrastructure, let's just take one example.,Take piping.,In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes,that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.,We bury them in the ground.,If anything changes -- if the environment changes,,the ground moves, or demand changes --,we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them. 
 So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,,that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials,and the built environment.,And I don't mean automated machines.,I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.,But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.,And that's called self-assembly,,which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure,through only local interaction. 
 So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?,We need a few simple ingredients.,The first ingredient is materials and geometry,,and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.,And you can use passive energy --,so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.,And then you need smartly designed interactions.,And those interactions allow for error correction,,and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state. 
 So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,,from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional,and even four-dimensional systems.,So in one-dimensional systems --,this is a project called the self-folding proteins.,And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --,in this case it's the crambin protein --,you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --,and you break that down into a series of components.,And then we embed elastic.,And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,,it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.,And this gives us a tangible model,of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds,and all of the intricacies of the geometry.,So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.,And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --,so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures. 
 In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal,with Autodesk and Arthur Olson,where we looked at autonomous parts --,so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.,And we built 500 of these glass beakers.,They had different molecular structures inside,and different colors that could be mixed and matched.,And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.,And so these became intuitive models,to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.,This is the polio virus.,You shake it hard and it breaks apart.,And then you shake it randomly,and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.,And this is demonstrating that through random energy,,we can build non-random shapes. 
 We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.,Last year at TED Long Beach,,we built an installation that builds installations.,The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?,So we built a large rotating chamber,,and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,,adding energy to the system,and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works,and how we could use this,as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products. 
 So remember, I said 4D.,So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,,which is a collaboration with Stratasys,,and it's called 4D printing.,The idea behind 4D printing,is that you take multi-material 3D printing --,so you can deposit multiple materials --,and you add a new capability,,which is transformation,,that right off the bed,,the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.,And this is like robotics without wires or motors.,So you completely print this part,,and it can transform into something else. 
 We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.,And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior,and try to optimize which parts are folding when.,But most importantly, we can use this same software,for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems,and human scale self-assembly systems.,These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.,Here's the first demonstration.,A single strand dipped in water,that completely self-folds on its own,into the letters M I T.,I'm biased.,This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank,that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.,So no human interaction.,And we think this is the first time,that a program and transformation,has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.,And it also might just be the manufacturing technique,that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future. 
 So I know you're probably thinking,,okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?,So I've started a lab at MIT,,and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.,And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials,for the built environment.,And we think there's a few key sectors,that have fairly near-term applications.,One of those is in extreme environments.,These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,,our current construction techniques don't work,,it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.,And space is a great example of that.,We're trying to design new scenarios for space,that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures,that can go from highly functional systems from one to another. 
 Let's go back to infrastructure.,In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.,And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.,Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract,to change capacity or change flow rate,,or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.,So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.,This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own. 
 So I want to remind you today,of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.,These are complex things built with complex parts,that come together in complex ways.,So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from,to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,,how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,,so that we can go from a world like this,to a world that's more like this. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like you all,to ask yourselves a question,which you may never havenasked yourselves before:,What is possible with the human voice?,What is possible with the human voice?,(Beatboxing),♪ Ooh baby ♪,♪ baby ♪,♪ baby ♪,♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying),♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying),♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing),(Dog barking),Yeah.,(Applause),(Boomerang noises),It was coming straight for me.nI had to. It was, yeah.,As you can probably well imagine,,I was a strange child.,(Laughter),Because the thing is,nI was constantly trying,to extend my repertoire of noises to be,the very maximum that it could be.,I was constantly experimentingnwith these noises.,And I'm still on that mission.,I'm still trying to find every noise,that I can possibly make.,And the thing is, I'm a bitnolder and wiser now,,and I know that there's some noises,I'll never be able to makenbecause I'm hemmed in,by my physical body,nand there's things it can't do.,And there's things that nonone's voice can do.,For example, no one can dontwo notes at the same time.,You can do two-tone singing,,which monks can do, which is like...,(Two-tone singing),But that's cheating.,And it hurts your throat.,So there's things you can'tndo, and these limitations,on the human voice havenalways really annoyed me,,because beatbox is the best way of getting,musical ideas out of your headnand into the world,,but they're sketches at best,,which is what's annoyed me.,If only, if only there was a way,for these ideas to come out unimpeded,by the restrictionsnwhich my body gives it.,So I've been working with these guys,,and we've made a machine.,We've made a system which is basically,a live production machine,,a real-time music production machine,,and it enables me to, usingnnothing but my voice,,create music in real timenas I hear it in my head,unimpeded by any physical restrictions,that my body might place on me.,And I'm going to show you what it can do.,And before I start making noises with it,,and using it to manipulate my voice,,I want to reiterate that everythingnthat you're about to hear,is being made by my voice.,This system has --,thank you, beautiful assistant --,this system has no sounds in it itself,until I start putting sounds in it,,so there's no prerecordednsamples of any kind.,So once this thing really gets going,,and it really starts to manglenthe audio I'm putting into it,,it becomes not obviousnthat it is the human voice,,but it is, so I'm going to takenyou through it bit by bit,and start nice and simple.,So the polyphony problem:nI've only got one voice.,How do I get around the problem,of really wanting to havenas many different voices,going on at the same time.,The simplest way to do itnis something like this.,(Beatboxing),By dancing. It's like this.,(Music),Thanks.,(Applause),So that's probably the easiest way.,But if you want to do somethingna little bit more immediate,,something that you can'tnachieve with live looping,,there's other ways to layer your voice up.,There's things like pitch-shifting,,which are awesome,,and I'm going to show younnow what that sounds like.,So I'm going to startnanother beat for you, like this.,(Beatboxing),There's always got to be a bitnof a dance at the start,,because it's just fun, so,you can clap along if you want.,You don't have to. It's fine.nCheck it out.,I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.,(Music),And now, a rockabilly guitar.,Which is nice. But what if I wantnto make, say, a -- (Applause) --,Thanks. What if I wantnto make, say, a rock organ?,Is that possible? Yes, it is,,by recording myself like this.,(Organ sound),And now I have that, I have that recorded.,Assign it to a keyboard.,(Music),So that's cool.,(Applause),But what if I wanted to soundnlike the whole of Pink Floyd?,Impossible, you say. No.,It is possible, and youncan do it very simply,using this machine. It's really fantastic.nCheck it out.,(Music),So every noise you cannhear there is my voice.,I didn't just trigger somethingnwhich sounds like that.,There's no samples.nThere's no synthesizers.,That is literally all my voicenbeing manipulated,,and when you get to that point,nyou have to ask, don't you,,what's the point?,Why do this? (Laughter),Because it's cheaper than hiringnthe whole of Pink Floyd,,I suppose, is the easy answer.,But in actual fact,nI haven't made this machine,so that I can emulatenthings that already exist.,I've made this so that I can make,any noise that I can imagine.,So with your permission, I'm going to do,some things that are in my mind,,and I hope you enjoy them,,because they're rather unusual,,especially when you'rendoing things which are,as unusual as this, itncan be hard to believe,that it is all my voice, you see.,(Voice effects),(Music),Like this.,(Music),So, loosely defined,,that is what's possiblenwith the human voice.,Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.,(Applause)Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years,of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.,That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Chris, that would take a miracle." 
 He said, "Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?" 
 So, yeah.,Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.,Let's go back before Christ, three millennia,,to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,,the march against inequality and poverty really began.,Three thousand years ago,,civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,,some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,,smelling of sheep shit, I guess,,proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,,"We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you." 
 And the Pharaoh replies, "Oh, no.,You, your miserableness, have got to be kidding." 
 And they say, "No, no, that's what it says here,in our holy book." 
 Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids,,another people spreading the same idea,of equality with a different book.,This time it's called the Facebook.,Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.,They turn a social network from virtual to actual,,and kind of rebooted the 21st century.,Not to undersell how messy and ugly,the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,,neither to oversell the role of technology,,but these things have given a sense of what's possible,when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,,gets turned upside down, putting the people on top,and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.,It's also shown us that something as powerful,as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,,because facts, like people,,want to be free, and when they're free,,liberty is usually around the corner,,even for the poorest of the poor --,facts that can challenge cynicism,and the apathy that leads to inertia,,facts that tell us what's working and,,more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,,facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us,meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made,back in 2005,,when he asked us to be that great generation,that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,,extreme poverty,,facts that build a powerful momentum. 
 So I thought, forget the rock opera,,forget the bombast, my usual tricks.,The only thing singing today would be the facts,,for I have truly embraced by inner nerd.,So exit the rock star.,Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist. 
 Because what the facts are telling us,is that the long, slow journey,,humanity's long, slow journey of equality,,is actually speeding up.,Look at what's been achieved.,Look at the pictures these data sets print.,Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,,there are eight million more AIDS patients,getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.,Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa,that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.,For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,,it's down by 2.65 million a year.,That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.,Wow. Wow. (Applause) 
 Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.,Have you read anything anywhere in the last week,that is remotely as important as that number? Wow.,Great news. It drives me nuts,that most people don't seem to know this news.,Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.,This is Michael and Benedicta,,and they're alive thanks in large part,to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing --,and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,,whether you know it or not.,And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs,that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.,This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.,It was fought for, it was campaigned for,,it was innovated for.,And this great news gives birth to even more great news,,because the historic trend is this.,The number of people living in back-breaking,,soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined,from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990,to 33 percent by 2000,and then to 21 percent by 2010.,Give it up for that. (Applause),Halved. Halved. 
 Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people,unnecessarily losing their lives.,There's still work to do.,But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.,And if you live on less than $1.25 a day,,if you live in that kind of poverty,,this is not just data.,This is everything.,If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am --,this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.,And guess what? If the trajectory continues,,look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day,gets to by 2030.,Can't be true, can it?,That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,,we get to, wow, the zero zone.,For number-crunchers like us,,that is the erogenous zone,,and it's fair to say that I am, by now,,sexually aroused by the collating of data.,So virtual elimination of extreme poverty,,as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,,adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.,We do love a good baseline.,That's amazing. 
 Now I know that some of you think this progress,is all in Asia or Latin America or,model countries like Brazil --,and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? --,but look at sub-Saharan Africa.,There's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,,who in the last decade have had a combination,of 100 percent debt cancellation,,a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI --,that's foreign direct investment --,which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that's local money --,which, when spent wisely -- that's good governance --,cut childhood mortality by a third,,doubled education completion rates,,and they, too, halved extreme poverty,,and at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.,So the pride of lions,is the proof of concept. 
 There are all kinds of benefits to this.,For a start, you won't have to listen,to an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.,How about that? (Applause) 
 And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.,I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.,(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.,Makes us look really young. 
 So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?,Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.,We can't get this done until we really accept,that we can get this done.,Look at this graph.,It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.,And the next one is really beautiful.,It's called momentum.,And it's how we can bend the arc of history,down towards zero,,just doing the things that we know work. 
 So inertia versus momentum.,There is jeopardy, and of course,,the closer you get, it gets harder.,We know the obstacles that are in our way,right now, in difficult times.,In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,,some who mind the nation's purse want to cut,life-saving programs like the Global Fund.,But you can do something about that.,You can tell politicians,that these cuts [can cost] lives. 
 Right now today, in Oslo as it happens,,oil companies are fighting to keep secret,their payments to governments,for extracting oil in developing countries.,You can do something about that too.,You can join the One Campaign,,and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.,We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some,of the wealth under the ground,ends up in the hands of the people living above it. 
 And right now, we know,that the biggest disease of all,is not a disease. It's corruption.,But there's a vaccine for that too.,It's called transparency, open data sets,,something the TED community is really on it.,Daylight, you could call it, transparency.,And technology is really turbocharging this.,It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff. 
 So let me tell you about the U-report,,which I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials,all across Uganda, young people,armed with 2G phones, an SMS social network,exposing government corruption,and demanding to know what's in the budget,and how their money is being spent.,This is exciting stuff. 
 Look, once you have these tools,,you can't not use them.,Once you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.,You can't delete this data from your brain,,but you can delete the cliched image,of supplicant, impoverished peoples,not taking control of their own lives.,You can erase that, you really can,,because it's not true anymore. (Applause) 
 It's transformational.,2030? By 2030, robots,,not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.,By the time we get there,,every place with a rough semblance of governance,might actually be on their way. 
 So I'm here to -- I guess we're here,to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,,the one we call factivism.,It's not going to kill you.,In fact, it could save countless lives.,I guess we in the One Campaign would love you,to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.,By doing so, you will join us and countless others,in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,,the ever-demanding journey of equality.,Could we really be the great generation,that Mandela asked us to be?,Might we answer that clarion call with science,,with reason, with facts,,and, dare I say it, emotions?,Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too. 
 I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.,Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups,behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.,He got thrown in jail for it,,but I have his words tattooed on my brain. 
 "We are going to win because we don't understand politics.,We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.,We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.,We are going to win because the tears,that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.,We are going to win because we have dreams,,and we're willing to stand up for those dreams." 
 Wael is right.,We're going to win,if we work together as one,,because the power of the people,is so much stronger than the people in power. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you so much. (Applause)The Kraken, a beast so terrifying,it was said to devour men and ships and whales,,and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.,In assessing the merits of such tales,,it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw,that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story,is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,",and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter) 
 Every fish that gets away,grows with every telling of the tale.,Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,,and we now have video proof,,as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. 
 I was one of the three scientists on this expedition,that took place last summer off Japan.,I'm the short one.,The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea. 
 I owe my participation in this now-historic event,to TED.,In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue,held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos,as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.,I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,,one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.,Mike deGruy was also invited,,and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,,and he also talked to me about applying my approach,to something he's been involved with for a very long time,,which is the hunt for the giant squid.,It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,,a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel,that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter) 
 I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing,and optical luring of deep sea squid,in which I emphasized the importance,of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.,This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,,farting around in the dark,using these platforms,,and my impression that I saw more animals,working from the submersible,than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.,But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.,But I also felt like I saw more animals,working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,,two vehicles with the same field of view,but different propulsion systems. 
 So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.,So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,,and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance,and recorded the sound they made.,The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --,which you can probably just barely hear here,,uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.,The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.,It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise),But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics,and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise),I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away. 
 So for the deep sea squid hunt,,I proposed using an optical lure,attached to a camera platform,with no thrusters, no motors,,just a battery-powered camera,,and the only illumination coming from red light,that's invisible to most deep-sea animals,that are adapted to see primarily blue.,That's visible to our eye,,but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.,So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,,could just be thrown off the back of the ship,,attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,,it would just float around passively carried by the currents,,and the only light visible to the animals in the deep,would be the blue light of the optical lure,,which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,,because it was designed to imitate,the bioluminescent display,of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla. 
 Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces,is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,and is a form of defense.,The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure,is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,,but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light,when it's being chewed on by a predator,and its only hope for escape,may be to attract the attention of a larger predator,that will attack its attacker,and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.,It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,,and a common form of defense in the deep sea. 
 The approach worked.,Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner,a single video glimpse of the giant,,we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement. 
 Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there. 
 EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --,now you see me, now you don't --,and we had four such teasing appearances,,and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us. 
 (Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese) 
 Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa! 
 (Applause) 
 EW: The full monty. 
 What really wowed me about that,was the way it came in up over the e-jelly,and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,,which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly. 
 But even more incredible was the footage shot,from the Triton submersible.,What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary,was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,,a one-meter long diamondback squid,had a light attached to it, a squid jig,of the type that longline fishermen use,,and I think it was this light,that brought the giant in. 
 Now, what you're seeing,is the intensified camera's view under red light,,and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.,And then he got so excited,,he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,,and the giant didn't run away,,so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,,bringing a creature of legend,from the misty history into high-resolution video.,It was absolutely breathtaking,,and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact,and fully extended,,it would have been as tall as a two-story house. 
 How could something that big,live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?,We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.,There are great discoveries yet to be made down there,,fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution,and possibly bioactive compounds,that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.,Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction,of the money on ocean exploration,that we've spent on space exploration.,We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,,because we need to be exploring and protecting,our life support systems here on Earth. 
 We need — thank you. (Applause) 
 Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.,Innovation drives economic growth.,So let's all go exploring,,but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,,or, as Mike deGruy once said,,"If you want to get away from it all,and see something you've never seen,,or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,,get in a sub.",He should have been with us for this adventure.,We miss him.,(Applause)Growth is not dead. 
 (Applause) 
 Let's start the story 120 years ago,,when American factories began to electrify their operations,,igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.,The amazing thing is,that productivity did not increase in those factories,for 30 years. Thirty years.,That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.,You see, the first wave of managers,simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,,but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage,of electricity's flexibility.,It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,,and then productivity soared,,often doubling or even tripling in those factories. 
 Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,,like the steam engine before it.,General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,,because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,,like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.,Is there a general purpose technology of our era?,Sure. It's the computer.,But technology alone is not enough.,Technology is not destiny.,We shape our destiny,,and just as the earlier generations of managers,needed to redesign their factories,,we're going to need to reinvent our organizations,and even our whole economic system.,We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.,As we'll see in a moment,,productivity is actually doing all right,,but it has become decoupled from jobs,,and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.,These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed,as the end of innovation,,but they are actually the growing pains,of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age. 
 Let's look at some data.,So here's GDP per person in America.,There's some bumps along the way, but the big story,is you could practically fit a ruler to it.,This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth,is actually an acceleration in real terms.,And here's productivity.,You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,,but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,,when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.,After a lag, productivity accelerated again.,So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself,,but sometimes it rhymes.",Today, productivity is at an all-time high,,and despite the Great Recession,,it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,,the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.,It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.,And that's just the United States.,The global news is even better.,Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate,in the past decade than ever in history. 
 If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,,because the new machine age,is more about knowledge creation,than just physical production.,It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,,ideas not things.,That creates a problem for standard metrics,,because we're getting more and more stuff for free,,like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,,and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.,Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?,Sure, of course it is.,But that's not how economists measure GDP.,Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.,According to the numbers, the music industry,is half the size that it was 10 years ago,,but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.,You know, I bet you are too.,In total, my research estimates,that the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year,in free goods and services on the Internet.,Now let's look to the future.,There are some super smart people,who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,,but to understand the future of growth,,we need to make predictions,about the underlying drivers of growth.,I'm optimistic, because the new machine age,is digital, exponential and combinatorial. 
 When goods are digital, they can be replicated,with perfect quality at nearly zero cost,,and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.,Welcome to the economics of abundance.,But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.,Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.,In the age of big data,,we can measure the world in ways we never could before. 
 Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.,Computers get better faster than anything else ever.,A child's Playstation today is more powerful,than a military supercomputer from 1996.,But our brains are wired for a linear world.,As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.,I used to teach my students that there are some things,,you know, computers just aren't good at,,like driving a car through traffic.,(Laughter),That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen,because we just rode down Route 101,in, yes, a driverless car. 
 Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.,The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,,like low-hanging fruit,,but the reality is that each innovation,creates building blocks for even more innovations.,Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,,an undergraduate student of mine,built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.,He was able to do that so easily,because he built it on top of Facebook,,and Facebook was built on top of the web,,and that was built on top of the Internet,,and so on and so forth. 
 Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial,would each be game-changers.,Put them together, and we're seeing a wave,of astonishing breakthroughs,,like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah,or leap tall buildings in a single bound.,You know, robots are even revolutionizing,cat transportation. 
 (Laughter) 
 But perhaps the most important invention,,the most important invention is machine learning.,Consider one project: IBM's Watson.,These little dots here,,those are all the champions on the quiz show "Jeopardy.",At first, Watson wasn't very good,,but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,,and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart,to my class at MIT,,Watson beat the world "Jeopardy" champion.,At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.,Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.,The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.,Damn. (Laughter) 
 But you know, Watson is growing up fast.,It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.,It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,,and getting some of them.,Isn't it ironic that at the very moment,we are building intelligent machines,,perhaps the most important invention in human history,,some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?,Like the first two industrial revolutions,,the full implications of the new machine age,are going to take at least a century to fully play out,,but they are staggering. 
 So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?,No. Technology is not destiny.,Productivity is at an all time high,,but fewer people now have jobs.,We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,,but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.,This is the great decoupling,of productivity from employment,,of wealth from work.,You know, it's not surprising that millions of people,have become disillusioned by the great decoupling,,but like too many others,,they misunderstand its basic causes.,Technology is racing ahead,,but it's leaving more and more people behind.,Today, we can take a routine job,,codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,,and then replicate it a million times. 
 You know, I recently overheard a conversation,that epitomizes these new economics.,This guy says, "Nah, I don't use H&R Block anymore.,TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,,but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate.",How can a skilled worker,compete with a $39 piece of software?,She can't.,Today, millions of Americans do have faster,,cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,,and the founders of Intuit,have done very well for themselves.,But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.,That is a microcosm of what's happening,,not just in software and services, but in media and music,,in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --,in short, in every industry.,People are racing against the machine,,and many of them are losing that race. 
 What can we do to create shared prosperity?,The answer is not to try to slow down technology.,Instead of racing against the machine,,we need to learn to race with the machine.,That is our grand challenge. 
 The new machine age,can be dated to a day 15 years ago,when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,,played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.,The machine won that day,,and today, a chess program running on a cell phone,can beat a human grandmaster.,It got so bad that, when he was asked,what strategy he would use against a computer,,Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,,"I'd bring a hammer." 
 (Laughter) 
 But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.,Neither is a human,,because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament,where teams of humans and computers,could work together,,and the winning team had no grandmaster,,and it had no supercomputer.,What they had was better teamwork,,and they showed that a team of humans and computers,,working together, could beat any computer,or any human working alone.,Racing with the machine,beats racing against the machine.,Technology is not destiny.,We shape our destiny. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, I was introduced as,the former Governor of Michigan,,but actually I'm a scientist.,All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,,but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy,that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,,I was experimenting with policy,about what would achieve the greatest good,for the greatest number.,But there were three problems, three enigmas,that I could not solve,,and I want to share with you those problems,,but most importantly,,I think I figured out a proposal for a solution. 
 The first problem,that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,,how do you create good jobs in America,in a global economy? 
 So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.,I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,,I got a call from one of my staff members, who said,,"Gov, we have a big problem.,We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,,population 8,000,,and they are about to lose their major employer,,which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux." 
 And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?" 
 And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville." 
 So it is a one-company town.,And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico. 
 So I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.,We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville,with my whole cabinet and we will just,make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse." 
 So I brought my whole cabinet,,and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville --,the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college --,and we basically emptied our pockets,and put all of our chips on the table,,incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,,and as we made our pile of chips,,we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.,And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,,or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,,we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,,said they would offer unprecedented concessions,,sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville. 
 So the management of Electrolux took our pile,,our list of incentives, and they went outside the room,for 17 minutes,,and they came back in and they said,,"Wow, this is the most generous,any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.,But there's nothing you can do,to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour,in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving." 
 And they did. And when they did, it was like,a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.,In fact, they did implode the factory.,That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.,And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,,the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,,had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.,It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,,and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor,that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,,and I wanted to grieve with them,,and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.,It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches,on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,,or a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter) 
 And this guy comes up to me,,and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,,and he had his two daughters with him,,and he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters.",He said, "I'm 48 years old,,and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.,I went from high school to factory.,My father worked at this factory," he said.,"My grandfather worked at this factory.,All I know is how to make refrigerators.",And he looked at his daughters,,and he puts his hand on his chest,,and he says, "So, Gov, tell me,,who is ever going to hire me?,Who is ever going to hire me?",And that was asked not just by that guy,but by everyone in the pavilion,,and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories,that closed in the first decade of this century.,Enigma number one: How do you create jobs,in America in a global economy? 
 Number two, very quickly:,How do you solve global climate change,when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country,and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?,In fact, there was a poll that was done recently,and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings,to a number of other unpleasant things,,and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating,is worse than cockroaches,,lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter),But wait, the good news is it's at least better,than meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter),We got a problem, folks. 
 So it got me thinking, what is it?,What in the laboratory that I see out there,,the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?,What policy prescriptions have happened,that actually cause changes to occur,and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?,So if I asked you, for example,,what was the Obama Administration policy,that caused massive changes across the country,,what would you say?,You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.,As we know, only half the states have opted in.,We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.,The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur,was Race to the Top for education.,Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot,and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.,Forty-eight governors competed,,convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially,raise standards for high schoolers,so that they all take a college prep curriculum.,Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up. 
 So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that,and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?,Because after all, if you look at the context,,1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years,from the private sector globally,,and every dollar represents a job,,and where are those jobs going?,Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.,In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,,and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,,and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations,and standing next to one of the Chinese officials,,and we were watching, and he says,,"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?",And I said, "Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?" 
 And this is what he did, he goes, he says,,"Take your time.",Because they see our passivity as their opportunity. 
 So what if we decided to create,a challenge to the governors of the country,,and the price to entry into this competition,used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress,for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,,which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than,one tenth of one percent of federal spending.,It's a rounding error on the federal side.,But price to entry into that competition would be,,you could just, say, use the President's goal.,He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard,of 80 percent by 2030,,in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent,of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.,Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?,And imagine what might happen,,because every region has something to offer.,You might take states like Iowa and Ohio --,two very important political states, by the way --,those two governors, and they would say,,we're going to lead the nation in producing,the wind turbines and the wind energy.,You might say the solar states, the sun belt,,we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,,and maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create,an industry cluster in California,to be able to produce the solar panels,so that we're not buying them from China,but we're buying them from the U.S.",In fact, every region of the country could do this.,You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.,In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states,in the West, they could do geothermal,,or you could look at Texas and say,,we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.,In the middle eastern states which have access to forests,and to agricultural waste, they might say,,we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.,In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation,in energy efficiency solutions.,Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation,in offshore wind.,You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation,in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.,Every region has something to offer,,and if you created a competition,,it respects the states and it respects federalism.,It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,,who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,,you might even get them to opt in. Why?,Because Republican and Democratic governors,love to cut ribbons.,We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.,And it fosters innovation at the state level,in these laboratories of democracy. 
 Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately,might say, "Okay, great idea, but really?,Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?,They can't agree to anything.",So you could wait and go through Congress,,although you should be very impatient.,Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.,Go around Congress.,What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?,What if several of the high-net worth companies,and individuals who are here at TED decided,that they would create, band together, just a couple of them,,and create a national competition to the governors,to have a race to the top,and see how the governors respond?,What if it all started here at TED?,What if you were here,when we figured out how to crack the code,to create good paying jobs in America -- (Applause) --,and get national energy policy,and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up? 
 Because, dear TEDsters,,if you are impatient like I am,,you know that our economic competitors,,our other nations, are in the game,and are eating us for lunch.,And we can get in the game or not.,We can be at the table or we can be on the table.,And I don't know about you,,but I prefer to dine. 
 Thank you all so much. (Applause)All right, so let's take,four subjects that obviously go together:,big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.,Right? 
 Now, the issue about tattoos is that,,without a word, tattoos really do shout.,[Beautiful],[Intriguing],So you don't have to say a lot.,[Allegiance],[Very intimate],[Serious mistakes],(Laughter),And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.,If I can ask an indiscreet question,,how many of you have tattoos?,A few, but not most.,What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,,cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,,all these things you deal with every day,turn out to be electronic tattoos?,And what if they provide as much information,about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would? 
 What's ended up happening over the past few decades,is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state,or as a great celebrity,is now being applied to you every day by all these people,who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,,watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.,And electronic tattoos also shout.,And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,,it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,,because it's not just the electronic tattoos,,it's facial recognition that's getting really good.,So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,,although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter),But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,,take a picture, say, of this guy right here,,get the name, and download all the records,before you utter a word or speak to somebody,,because everybody turns out to be,absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. 
 And so there's companies like face.com that now have,about 18 billion faces online.,Here's what happened to this company.,[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...],There are other companies that will place a camera,like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook —,they take your picture, they tie it to the social media,,they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,,so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,,"Hey, we've got five black dresses,that would just look great on you." 
 So what if Andy was wrong?,Here's Andy's theory.,[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.],What if we flip this?,What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter),Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,,maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,,because these tattoos will live,far longer than our bodies will.,And if that's true, then what we want to do,is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks,and one lesson from a Latin American. 
 Why the Greeks?,Well, the Greeks thought about what happens,when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. 
 So lesson number one: Sisyphus.,Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time,to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,,roll back up, roll back down.,It's a little like your reputation.,Once you get that electronic tattoo,,you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,,so as you go through this stuff,,just be careful what you post. 
 Myth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,,charming to be around, great partier, great singer,,loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,,only person to charm his way into the underworld,,charms the gods of the underworld,,they release his beauty on the condition,he never look at her until they're out.,So he's walking out and walking out and walking out,and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.,With all this data out here, it might be a good idea,not to look too far into the past of those you love. 
 Lesson number three: Atalanta.,Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody.,If you won, she would marry you.,If you lost, you died.,How did Hippomenes beat her?,Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,,and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.,She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.,She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.,Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples,come and reach you and you want to post about them,or tweet about them or send a late-night message. 
 And then, of course, there's Narcissus.,Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.,(Laughter),But as you're thinking about Narcissus,,just don't fall in love with your own reflection. 
 Last lesson, from a Latin American:,This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.,When he was threatened by the thugs,of the Argentine military junta,,he came back and said, "Oh, come on,,how else can you threaten, other than with death?",The interesting thing, the original thing,,would be to threaten somebody with immortality.,And that, of course, is what we are all,now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?,Not very many of you.,Okay. And actually of those hands,,if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?,So a couple.,That's okay.,That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive --,that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving. 
 So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,,whether you're eight or 80.,And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,,because you have to build a small, portable robot,that's not only really affordable,,but it has to be something,that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.,This robot can't be creepy or uncanny.,He should be friendly and cute. 
 So meet Romo.,Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love --,your iPhone -- as his brain.,And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,,we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled,and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,,which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past. 
 When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.,So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.,If I duck down, he'll follow me.,He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.,If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.,If I come over here -- (Laughs),He's smart.,And if I get too close to him,,he gets scared just like any other creature.,So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.,Thanks, little guy.,(Sneezing sound),Bless you. 
 And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired --,if I want to explore the world with Romo,,I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.,So here's the iPad.,And Romo will actually stream video to this device.,So I can see everything that Romo sees,,and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.,Now this is a free app on the App Store,,so if any of you guys had this app on your phones,,we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together. 
 So I'll show you really quickly,,Romo actually -- he's streaming video,,so you can see me and the entire TED audience.,If I get in front of Romo here.,And if I want to control him, I can just drive.,So I can drive him around,,and I can take pictures of you.,I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.,So I'll snap a picture.,And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad,,I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.,So there are all of you through Romo's eyes.,And finally, because Romo is an extension of me,,I can express myself through his emotions.,So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited. 
 But the most important thing about Romo,is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.,You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.,In fact, who would like to drive a robot?,Okay. Awesome.,Here you go.,Thank you, Scott. 
 And even cooler, you actually don't have to be,in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.,So he actually streams two-way audio and video,between any two smart devices.,So you can log in through the browser,,and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.,So we were talking before about telepresence,,and this is a really cool example.,You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone,,and her mom buys her a robot.,That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot,,send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.,Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter,for fifteen minutes every single night,,when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year. 
 Thanks, Scott. 
 (Applause) 
 So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.,But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.,This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.,It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.,This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code,and create any behavior for this robot you want.,You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.,And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser,,which is what you see Romo doing on the left.,And then if you have something you like,,you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life,,run the program in real life.,And then if you have something you're proud of,,you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.,So all of these wi-fi–enabled robots actually learn from each other. 
 The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train,is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.,They change from person to person.,So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home,,that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination. 
 So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.,To be honest, I have no idea.,But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars,or a large humanoid robot away.,The future of personal robotics is happening today,,and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo,and the creativity of people like yourselves.,So we can't wait to get you all robots,,and we can't wait to see what you build. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What you're doing,,right now, at this very moment,,is killing you.,More than cars or the Internet,or even that little mobile device we keep talking about,,the technology you're using the most almost every day,is this, your tush.,Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,,which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.,Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,,we don't even question how much we're doing it,,and because everyone else is doing it,,it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.,In that way, sitting has become,the smoking of our generation. 
 Of course there's health consequences to this,,scary ones, besides the waist.,Things like breast cancer and colon cancer,are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],,Ten percent in fact, on both of those.,Six percent for heart disease,,seven percent for type 2 diabetes,,which is what my father died of.,Now, any of those stats should convince each of us,to get off our duff more,,but if you're anything like me, it won't. 
 What did get me moving was a social interaction.,Someone invited me to a meeting,,but couldn't manage to fit me in,to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,,"I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?",It seemed kind of odd to do,,and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,,"I have to be the one to ask the next question,",because I knew I was going to huff and puff,during this conversation.,And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.,So instead of going to coffee meetings,or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,,I ask people to go on a walking meeting,,to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.,It's changed my life. 
 But before that, what actually happened was,,I used to think about it as,,you could take care of your health,,or you could take care of obligations,,and one always came at the cost of the other.,So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,,I've learned a few things. 
 First, there's this amazing thing,about actually getting out of the box,that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.,Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works. 
 And second, and probably the more reflective one,,is just about how much each of us,can hold problems in opposition,when they're really not that way.,And if we're going to solve problems,and look at the world really differently,,whether it's in governance or business,or environmental issues, job creation,,maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems,as having both things be true.,Because it was when that happened,with this walk-and-talk idea,that things became doable and sustainable and viable. 
 So I started this talk talking about the tush,,so I'll end with the bottom line, which is,,walk and talk.,Walk the talk.,You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,,and in the way that you do,,you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, when I was in art school,,I developed a shake in my hand,,and this was the straightest line I could draw.,Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,,like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,,but at the time this was really doomsday.,This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. 
 The shake developed out of, really,,a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,,just years of making tiny, tiny dots.,And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round,to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.,So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,,and this progressively made the shake worse,,so I'd hold the pen tighter still.,And this became a vicious cycle that ended up,causing so much pain and joint issues,,I had trouble holding anything.,And after spending all my life wanting to do art,,I left art school, and then I left art completely. 
 But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,,and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake,and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.,And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,,and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?" 
 So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,,and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.,I was making all these scribble pictures.,And even though it wasn't the kind of art,that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.,And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,,I realized I could still make art.,I just had to find a different approach,to making the art that I wanted. 
 Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,,seeing these little tiny dots come together,to make this unified whole.,So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images,where the shake wouldn't affect the work,,like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,,or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,,creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.,I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,,my hand really wouldn't hurt,,and after having gone from a single approach to art,,I ended up having an approach to creativity,that completely changed my artistic horizons.,This was the first time I'd encountered this idea,that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. 
 At the time, I was finishing up school,,and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.,I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like,I could do so much more with the supplies,I thought an artist was supposed to have.,I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.,I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair,from the office that I worked at. 
 So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,,I got myself to the art store,,and I just went nuts buying supplies.,And then when I got home, I sat down,and I set myself to task to really try to create something,just completely outside of the box.,But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.,The same thing the next day, and then the next,,quickly slipping into a creative slump.,And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.,And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able,to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank. 
 But as I searched around in the darkness,,I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices,that I never had before.,And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.,Embrace the shake.,And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,,I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box,and get back into it. 
 I wondered, could you become more creative, then,,by looking for limitations?,What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?,At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in --,well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —,but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,,so I decided to ask for 50.,Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,,and then with some pencils I already had,,I made this project for only 80 cents.,It really became a moment of clarification for me,that we need to first be limited,in order to become limitless. 
 I took this approach of thinking inside the box,to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of,painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?,So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,,one on top of another,,with each picture representing an influence in my life.,Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,,I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter),So I'd dip my hands in paint,,and I just attacked the canvas,,and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie,and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Or, what if instead of relying on myself,,I had to rely on other people,to create the content for the art?,So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.,I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,,and I asked people to call me and share a story with me,about a life-changing moment.,Their stories became the art,as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. 
 (Applause),Or what if instead of making art to display,,I had to destroy it?,This seemed like the ultimate limitation,,being an artist without art.,This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project,that I called Goodbye Art,,where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.,In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on,forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,,made with over 7,000 matches.,(Laughter),Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.,I looked for temporary materials,,like spitting out food --,(Laughter) —,sidewalk chalk,and even frozen wine. 
 The last iteration of destruction,was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.,So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,,then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,,then assembled the videos into the larger image.,So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.,It was destroyed before it ever existed. 
 In the course of this Goodbye Art series,,I created 23 different pieces,with nothing left to physically display.,What I thought would be the ultimate limitation,actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,,as each time I created,,the destruction brought me back to a neutral place,where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.,It did not happen overnight.,There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,,or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them,the end image was kind of embarrassing.,But having committed to the process, I continued on, 
 and something really surprising came out of this.,As I destroyed each project,,I was learning to let go,,let go of outcomes, let go of failures,,and let go of imperfections.,And in return, I found a process of creating art,that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.,I found myself in a state of constant creation,,thinking only of what's next,and coming up with more ideas than ever. 
 When I think back to my three years away from art,,away from my dream, just going through the motions,,instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,,I just quit, I gave up.,And what if I didn't embrace the shake?,Because embracing the shake for me,wasn't just about art and having art skills.,It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.,Because ultimately, most of what we do,takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.,Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations,is the best hope we have to transform ourselves,and, collectively, transform our world. 
 Looking at limitations as a source of creativity,changed the course of my life.,Now, when I run into a barrier,or I find myself creatively stumped,,I sometimes still struggle,,but I continue to show up for the process,and try to remind myself of the possibilities,,like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,,using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,,or painting a picture with hamburger grease. 
 (Laughter) 
 One of my most recent endeavors,is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned,into something others can replicate. 
 Limitations may be the most unlikely of places,to harness creativity, but perhaps,one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,,rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.,And instead of telling each other to seize the day,,maybe we can remind ourselves every day,to seize the limitation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)That's how we traveled in the year 1900.,That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.,It doesn't have air conditioning.,That horse is pulling it along,at one percent of the speed of sound,,and the rutted dirt road,turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.,That's a Boeing 707.,Only 60 years later, it travels,at 80 percent of the speed of sound,,and we don't travel any faster today,because commercial supersonic air travel,turned out to be a bust. 
 So I started wondering and pondering,,could it be that the best years of American economic growth,are behind us?,And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth,is almost over.,Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.,There are four headwinds that are just hitting,the American economy in the face.,They're demographics, education, debt and inequality.,They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.,So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.,And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,,if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been,in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.,If innovation is less powerful,,invents less great, wonderful things,,then growth is going to be even lower than half of history. 
 Now here's eight centuries of economic growth.,The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,,zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.,The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.,takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,,when the line switches to red.,You'll notice that, for the first four centuries,,there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.,Then growth gets better and better.,It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,,and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.,That last downward notch in the red line,is not actual data.,That is a forecast that I made six years ago,that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.,But you know what the actual facts are?,You know what the growth in per-person income has been,in the United States in the last six years?,Negative. 
 This led to a fantasy.,What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?,I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,,but I decided I would end it at 0.2,,just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.,Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown,at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,,1891 to 2007,,and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.,But if growth slows down,,instead of doubling our standard of living every generation,,Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,,or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.,Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.,The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.,You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,,we were at about 5,000 dollars.,Today we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output,per member of the population.,Now what if we could achieve that historic,two-percent growth for the next 70 years?,Well, it's a matter of arithmetic.,Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.,That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.,Well, we're not going to do that,,and the reason is the headwinds. 
 The first headwind is demographics.,It's a truism that your standard of living,rises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,,if hours per person increased.,And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s,when women entered the labor force.,But now it's turned around.,Now hours per person are shrinking,,first because of the retirement of the baby boomers,,and second because there's been a very significant,dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males,who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution. 
 The next headwind is education.,We've got problems all over our educational system,despite Race to the Top.,In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education,that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.,We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,,and our college completion rate,is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.,We have a lot of debt.,Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007,on the back of consumers massively overborrowing.,Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons,why our economic recovery is so sluggish today.,And everybody of course knows,that the federal government debt is growing,as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,,and the only way that's going to stop is some combination,of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,,also called transfer payments.,And that gets us down from the 1.5,,where we've reached for education, down to 1.3. 
 And then we have inequality.,Over the 15 years before the financial crisis,,the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent,of the income distribution was half a point slower,than the averages we've been talking about before.,All the rest went to the top one percent.,So that brings us down to 0.8.,And that 0.8 is the big challenge.,Are we going to grow at 0.8?,If so, that's going to require that our inventions,are as important as the ones that happened,over the last 150 years.,So let's see what some of those inventions were. 
 If you wanted to read in 1875 at night,,you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.,They created pollution, they created odors,,they were hard to control, the light was dim,,and they were a fire hazard.,By 1929, electric light was everywhere.,We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.,Central Manhattan became possible.,And then, in addition to that, at the same time,,hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools,and hand-powered electric tools,,all achieved by electricity. 
 Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women.,Women, back in the late 19th century,,spent two days a week doing the laundry.,They did it on a scrub board.,Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry.,Then they had to bring them in.,The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.,And then we had the electric washing machine.,And by 1950, they were everywhere.,But the women still had to shop every day,,but no they didn't, because electricity,brought us the electric refrigerator. 
 Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes,was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.,The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.,But by 1929, certainly by 1950,,we had central heating everywhere. 
 What about the internal combustion engine,,which was invented in 1879?,In America, before the motor vehicle,,transportation depended entirely on the urban horse,,which dropped, without restraint,,25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day,together with a gallon of urine.,That comes out at five to 10 tons daily,per square mile in cities.,Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.,That's the percentage of American agricultural land,it took to feed the horses.,Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented,,and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,,that agricultural land could be used for human consumption,or for export.,And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,,only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households,in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years. 
 Back before the turn of the century,,women had another problem.,All the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing,had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.,It's a historical fact that in 1885,,the average North Carolina housewife,walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.,But by 1929, cities around the country,had put in underground water pipes.,They had put in underground sewer pipes,,and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,,waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.,And an amazing fact for techno-optimists,is that in the first half of the 20th century,,the rate of improvement of life expectancy,was three times faster than it was,in the second half of the 19th century. 
 So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.,And I'll just give you a few examples.,We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.,Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,,they all went from zero to 100 percent.,Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm.,We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent,by the early postwar years. 
 What about the electronic revolution?,Here's an early computer.,It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.,By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements,were being produced by computers.,The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers,were invented in the 1970s.,The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,,ATM machines to replace bank tellers,,bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.,Fast forward through the '90s,,we had the dotcom revolution,and a temporary rise in productivity growth. 
 But I'm now going to give you an experiment.,You have to choose either option A or option B.,(Laughter),Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.,So you get Google, you get Amazon,,you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.,Or you get everything invented to yesterday,,including Facebook and your iPhone,,but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,,and carry in the water.,Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,,maybe for a couple of days,,in some cases for more than a week,,electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,,and a charge for their iPhones. 
 The problem we face is that all these great inventions,,we have to match them in the future,,and my prediction that we're not going to match them,brings us down from the original two-percent growth,down to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning. 
 So here we are back to the horse and buggy.,I'd like to award an Oscar,to the inventors of the 20th century,,the people from Alexander Graham Bell,to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,,I'd like to call them all up here,,and they're going to call back to you.,Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, Arthur C. Clarke,,a famous science fictionnwriter from the 1950s,,said that, "We overestimatentechnology in the short term,,and we underestimate it in the long term.",And I think that's some of the fearnthat we see,about jobs disappearing from artificialnintelligence and robots.,That we're overestimatingnthe technology in the short term.,But I am worried whether we're going to getnthe technology we need in the long term.,Because the demographics are really goingnto leave us with lots of jobs that need doing,and that we, our society, is going to have to be builtnon the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.,So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.,But fear of losing jobs to technologynhas been around for a long time.,Back in 1957, there was a SpencernTracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.,So you know how it ended up,,Spencer Tracy brought a computer,na mainframe computer of 1957, in,to help the librarians.,The librarians in the company would donthings like answer for the executives,,"What are the names of Santa's reindeer?",And they would look that up.,And this mainframe computer was goingnto help them with that job.,Well of course a mainframe computernin 1957 wasn't much use for that job.,The librarians were afraidntheir jobs were going to disappear.,But that's not what happened in fact.,The number of jobs for librariansnincreased for a long time after 1957.,It wasn't until the Internetncame into play,,the web came into play and searchnengines came into play,that the need for librarians went down.,And I think everyone from 1957ntotally underestimated,the level of technology we would all carrynaround in our hands and in our pockets today.,And we can just ask: "What are the namesnof Santa's reindeer?" and be told instantly --,or anything else we want to ask.,By the way, the wagesnfor librarians went up faster,than the wages for other jobs in the U.S.nover that same time period,,because librarians becamenpartners of computers.,Computers became tools, and they gotnmore tools that they could use,and become more effectivenduring that time.,Same thing happened in offices.,Back in the old days,npeople used spreadsheets.,Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,,and they calculated by hand.,But here was an interestingnthing that came along.,With the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,,the spreadsheet programs werentuned for office workers,,not to replace office workers,,but it respected office workersnas being capable of being programmers.,So office workers becamenprogrammers of spreadsheets.,It increased their capabilities.,They no longer had to donthe mundane computations,,but they could do something much more.,Now today, we're startingnto see robots in our lives.,On the left therenis the PackBot from iRobot.,When soldiers came across roadsidenbombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,,instead of putting on a bomb suitnand going out and poking with a stick,,as they used to do up until about 2002,,they now send the robot out.,So the robot takesnover the dangerous jobs.,On the right are some TUGs from a companyncalled Aethon in Pittsburgh.,These are in hundredsnof hospitals across the U.S.,And they take the dirtynsheets down to the laundry.,They take the dirty dishesnback to the kitchen.,They bring the medicinesnup from the pharmacy.,And it frees up the nursesnand the nurse's aides,from doing that mundane work of justnmechanically pushing stuff around,to spend more time with patients.,In fact, robots have become sortnof ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.,But I think when it comes to factorynrobots, people are sort of afraid,,because factory robotsnare dangerous to be around.,In order to program them, you have to understandnsix-dimensional vectors and quaternions.,And ordinary people can'tninteract with them.,And I think it's the sortnof technology that's gone wrong.,It's displaced the workernfrom the technology.,And I think we really havento look at technologies,that ordinary workers can interact with.,And so I want to tell you today about Baxter,nwhich we've been talking about.,And Baxter, I see, as a wayn-- a first wave of robot,that ordinary people can interactnwith in an industrial setting.,So Baxter is up here.,This is Chris Harbertnfrom Rethink Robotics.,We've got a conveyor there.,And if the lighting isn't too extreme --,Ah, ah! There it is. It's pickednup the object off the conveyor.,It's going to come bring itnover here and put it down.,And then it'll go back,nreach for another object.,The interesting thing is Baxternhas some basic common sense.,By the way, what's going on with the eyes?,The eyes are on the screen there.,The eyes look ahead wherenthe robot's going to move.,So a person that's interactingnwith the robot,understands where it's going to reachnand isn't surprised by its motions.,Here Chris took the objectnout of its hand,,and Baxter didn't gonand try to put it down;,it went back and realizednit had to get another one.,It's got a little bit of basic commonnsense, goes and picks the objects.,And Baxter's safe to interact with.,You wouldn't want to do thisnwith a current industrial robot.,But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.,It feels the force, understandsnthat Chris is there,and doesn't push through him and hurt him.,But I think the most interesting thingnabout Baxter is the user interface.,And so Chris is going to comenand grab the other arm now.,And when he grabs an arm, it goesninto zero-force gravity-compensated mode,and graphics come up on the screen.,You can see some icons on the left of the screennthere for what was about its right arm.,He's going to put something in its hand,nhe's going to bring it over here,,press a button and let gonof that thing in the hand.,And the robot figures out, ah, he mustnmean I want to put stuff down.,It puts a little icon there.,He comes over here, and he getsnthe fingers to grasp together,,and the robot infers, ah, younwant an object for me to pick up.,That puts the green icon there.,He's going to map out an area of wherenthe robot should pick up the object from.,It just moves it around, and the robotnfigures out that was an area search.,He didn't have to select that from a menu.,And now he's going to go off and trainnthe visual appearance of that object,while we continue talking.,So as we continue here,,I want to tell you about what thisnis like in factories.,These robots we're shipping every day.,They go to factories around the country.,This is Mildred.,Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.,She's worked on the linenfor over 20 years.,One hour after she saw hernfirst industrial robot,,she had programmed it to donsome tasks in the factory.,She decided she really liked robots.,And it was doing the simple repetitiventasks that she had had to do beforehand.,Now she's got the robot doing it.,When we first went out to talknto people in factories,about how we could get robotsnto interact with them better,,one of the questions we asked them was,,"Do you want your childrennto work in a factory?",The universal answer was "No, I wantna better job than that for my children.",And as a result of that,nMildred is very typical,of today's factory workers in the U.S.,They're older, and they'rengetting older and older.,There aren't many young peoplencoming into factory work.,And as their tasks becomenmore onerous on them,,we need to give them toolsnthat they can collaborate with,,so that they can be part of the solution,,so that they can continue to worknand we can continue to produce in the U.S.,And so our vision is that Mildrednwho's the line worker,becomes Mildred the robot trainer.,She lifts her game,,like the office workers of the 1980snlifted their game of what they could do.,We're not giving them tools that they have to gonand study for years and years in order to use.,They're tools that they can just learnnhow to operate in a few minutes.,There's two great forcesnthat are both volitional but inevitable.,That's climate change and demographics.,Demographics is reallyngoing to change our world.,This is the percentagenof adults who are working age.,And it's gone down slightlynover the last 40 years.,But over the next 40 years, it's goingnto change dramatically, even in China.,The percentage of adults who are workingnage drops dramatically.,And turned up the other way, the peoplenwho are retirement age goes up very, very fast,,as the baby boomers get to retirement age.,That means there will be more peoplenwith fewer social security dollars,competing for services.,But more than that, as we getnolder we get more frail,and we can't do all the tasksnwe used to do.,If we look at the statisticsnon the ages of caregivers,,before our eyes those caregiversnare getting older and older.,That's happening statistically right now.,And as the number of people who are older,nabove retirement age and getting older, as they increase,,there will be less peoplento take care of them.,And I think we're really goingnto have to have robots to help us.,And I don't mean robotsnin terms of companions.,I mean robots doing the thingsnthat we normally do for ourselves,but get harder as we get older.,Getting the groceries in from the car,nup the stairs, into the kitchen.,Or even, as we get very much older,,driving our cars to go visit people.,And I think robotics gives people a chancento have dignity as they get older,by having control of the robotic solution.,So they don't have to rely on peoplenthat are getting scarcer to help them.,And so I really think that we'rengoing to be spending more time,with robots like Baxter,and working with robots like Baxternin our daily lives. And that we will --,Here, Baxter, it's good.,And that we will all come to relynon robots over the next 40 years,as part of our everyday lives.,Thanks very much.,(Applause)I'm not sure that every person here,is familiar with my pictures.,I want to start to show just a few pictures to you,,and after I'll speak. 
 I must speak to you a little bit of my history,,because we'll be speaking on this,during my speech here.,I was born in 1944 in Brazil,,in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.,I was born on a farm,,a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].,A marvelous place.,I lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,,I swam in our small rivers with our caimans.,It was about 35 families that lived on this farm,,and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.,Very few things went to the market.,Once a year, the only thing that went to the market,was the cattle that we produced,,and we made trips of about 45 days,to reach the slaughterhouse,,bringing thousands of head of cattle,,and about 20 days traveling back,to reach our farm again. 
 When I was 15 years old,,it was necessary for me to leave this place,and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger --,where I did the second part of secondary school.,There I learned different things.,Brazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,,and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,,I was a member of leftist parties,,and I became an activist.,I [went to] university to become an economist.,I [did] a master's degree in economics. 
 And the most important thing in my life,also happened in this time.,I met an incredible girl,who became my lifelong best friend,,and my associate in everything that I have done till now,,my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado. 
 Brazil radicalized very strongly.,We fought very hard against the dictatorship,,in a moment it was necessary to us:,Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,,or leave Brazil. We were too young,,and our organization thought it was better for us to go out,,and we went to France,,where I did a PhD in economics,,Léila became an architect.,I worked after for an investment bank.,We made a lot of trips, financed development,,economic projects in Africa with the World Bank. 
 And one day photography made a total invasion in my life.,I became a photographer,,abandoned everything and became a photographer,,and I started to do the photography,that was important for me.,Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist,,that you are an anthropologist photographer,,that you are an activist photographer.,But I did much more than that.,I put photography as my life.,I lived totally inside photography,doing long term projects,,and I want to show you just a few pictures,of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects,,that I went to, I published many books,on these photographs,,but I'll just show you a few ones now. 
 In the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,,I photographed a story called Migrations.,It became a book. It became a show. 
 But during the time that I was photographing this,,I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.,I saw in Rwanda total brutality.,I saw deaths by thousands per day.,I lost my faith in our species.,I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,,and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.,I started to have infection everywhere.,When I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;,I had blood.,I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,,told him that I was completely sick.,He made a long examination, and told me, "Sebastian,,you are not sick, your prostate is perfect.,What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.,You must stop. Stop.,You must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead." 
 And I made the decision to stop.,I was really upset with photography,,with everything in the world,,and I made the decision to go back to where I was born.,It was a big coincidence.,It was the moment that my parents became very old.,I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,,and they made together the decision,to transfer this land to Léila and myself.,When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.,When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.,When we received the land,,it was less than half a percent rainforest,,as in all my region.,To build development, Brazilian development,,we destroyed a lot of our forest.,As you did here in the United States,,or you did in India, everywhere in this planet.,To build our development,,we come to a huge contradiction,that we destroy around us everything.,This farm that had thousands of head of cattle,had just a few hundreds,,and we didn't know how to deal with these.,And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea. 
 She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?,You say that you were born in paradise.,Let's build the paradise again. 
 And I went to see a good friend,that was engineering forests,to prepare a project for us,,and we started. We started to plant, and this,first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,,and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.,We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,,only local species, only native species,,where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,,and the life started to come back in an incredible way.,It was necessary for us to transform our land,into a national park.,We transformed. We gave this land back to nature.,It became a national park.,We created an institution called Instituto Terra,,and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.,Here in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,,it became tax deductible in the United States.,We raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.,We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil,that put money into this project, the government.,And the life started to come, and I had a big wish,to come back to photography, to photograph again.,And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore,just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.,I wished to photograph the other animals,,to photograph the landscapes,,to photograph us, but us from the beginning,,the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.,And I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,,and I finished at the end of 2011.,We created an incredible amount of pictures,,and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books,,the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.,And what we want with these pictures,is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet,and what we must hold on this planet,if we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.,And I wanted to see us,when we used, yes, our instruments in stone.,We exist yet. I was last week,at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,,and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups,of Indians that are not contacted yet.,We must protect the forest in this sense.,And with these pictures, I hope that we can create,information, a system of information.,We tried to do a new presentation of the planet,,and I want to show you now just a few pictures,of this project, please. 
 Well, this — (Applause) —,Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 This is what we must fight hard,to hold like it is now.,But there is another part that we must together rebuild,,to build our societies, our modern family of societies,,we are at a point where we cannot go back.,But we create an incredible contradiction.,To build all this, we destroy a lot.,Our forest in Brazil, that antique forest,that was the size of California,,is destroyed today 93 percent.,Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.,Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone.,Gone very fast, disappeared.,Coming the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,,I was flying over deserts,that we made, we provoked with our own hands.,India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees. 
 And we must rebuild these forests.,That is the essence of our life, these forests.,We need to breathe. The only factory,capable to transform CO2 into oxygen,,are the forests.,The only machine capable to capture the carbon,that we are producing, always,,even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,,are the trees.,I put the question -- three or four weeks ago,,we saw in the newspapers,millions of fish that die in Norway.,A lack of oxygen in the water.,I put to myself the question, if for a moment,,we will not lack oxygen for all animal species,,ours included -- that would be very complicated for us. 
 For the water system, the trees are essential.,I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.,You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,,if you take a shower, it takes you,two or three hours to dry your hair,if you don't use a dryer machine.,Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.,The trees are the hair of our planet.,When you have rain in a place that has no trees,,in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,,brings soil, destroying our water source,,destroying the rivers,,and no humidity to retain.,When you have trees, the root system holds the water.,All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down,create a humid area,,and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,,and maintain our source, maintain our rivers.,This is the most important thing,,when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life. 
 I want to show you now, to finish,,just a few pictures that for me,are very important in that direction.,You remember that I told you,,when I received the farm from my parents,that was my paradise, that was the farm.,Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.,But you can see in this picture,,we were starting to construct an educational center,that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.,But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.,In each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.,There are thousands of trees.,Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point,two months ago. 
 (Applause) 
 I told you in the beginning that it was necessary,for us to plant about 2.5 million trees,of about 200 different species,in order to rebuild the ecosystem.,And I'll show you the last picture.,We are with two million trees in the ground now.,We are doing the sequestration,of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees. 
 My friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?,By an accident that happened to me,,we went back, we built an ecosystem.,We here inside the room,,I believe that we have the same concern,,and the model that we created in Brazil,,we can transplant it here.,We can apply it everywhere around the world, no?,And I believe that we can do it together. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Growing up in Taiwan,as the daughter of a calligrapher,,one of my most treasured memories,was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape,and the form of Chinese characters.,Ever since then, I was fascinated,by this incredible language. 
 But to an outsider, it seems to be,as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.,Over the past few years, I've been wondering,if I can break down this wall,,so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate,the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.,I started thinking about how a new, fast method,of learning Chinese might be useful. 
 Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw,every single stroke for each character,in the correct sequence.,I learned new characters every day,during the course of the next 15 years.,Since we only have five minutes,,it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.,A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.,You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.,The top 200 will allow you to comprehend,40 percent of basic literature --,enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,,to understand the basic idea of the web pages,or the newspapers.,Today I'm going to start with eight,to show you how the method works.,You are ready? 
 Open your mouth as wide as possible,until it's square.,You get a mouth.,This is a person going for a walk.,Person.,If the shape of the fire is a person,with two arms on both sides,,as if she was yelling frantically,,"Help! I'm on fire!" --,This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,,but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.,This is a tree.,Tree.,This is a mountain.,The sun.,The moon.,The symbol of the door,looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. 
 I call these eight characters radicals.,They are the building blocks,for you to create lots more characters.,A person.,If someone walks behind, that is "to follow.",As the old saying goes,,two is company, three is a crowd.,If a person stretched their arms wide,,this person is saying, "It was this big.",The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.,He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.,One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.,Three trees together, we create the forest.,Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.,Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." (Laughter),Easy to remember,,since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.,Remember fire?,Two fires together, I get really hot.,Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.,Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.,For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.,Two suns together, prosperous.,Three together, that's sparkles.,Put the sun and the moon shining together,,it's brightness.,It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.,The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.,A door. Put a plank inside the door,,it's a door bolt.,Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.,Knock knock. Is anyone home?,This person is sneaking out of a door,,escaping, evading.,On the left, we have a woman.,Two women together, they have an argument.,(Laughter),Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. 
 So we have gone through almost 30 characters.,By using this method, the first eight radicals,will allow you to build 32.,The next group of eight characters,will build an extra 32.,So with very little effort,,you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,,which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.,So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.,For example, the mountain and the fire together,,we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.,We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.,This is a sun placed with the origin,,because Japan lies to the east of China.,So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.,A person behind Japan, what do we get?,A Japanese person. 
 The character on the left is two mountains,stacked on top of each other.,In ancient China, that means in exile,,because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies,in exile beyond mountains.,Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.,A mouth which tells you where to get out,is an exit. 
 This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking,and get off of the stage. Thank you.

 (Laughter) 
 We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,,and we fell in love with it.,We hope you guys will too.,This next song is an originalnwe wrote called "Time Lapse,",and it will probably live up to its name.

 On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny. 
 (Applause) 
 He's also our brother.,And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14,nand I play the fiddle. 
 (Applause) 
 As you can see, we decidednto make it hard on ourselves,,and we chose to play three songs,in three different keys. 
 (Tuning) 
 Yeah. I'm also going to explain,na lot of people want to know,where we got the namen"Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.,So, it started when Jonny was little,,and he first started the banjo,nhe would play on his back,with his eyes closed,,and we'd say it lookednlike he was sleeping.,So you can probably piecenthe rest together. 
 TM: We can't really figure out the reason.,It might have beennthat it weighs about a million pounds.

 RM: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Now, extinction is a different kind of death.,It's bigger.,We didn't really realize that until 1914,,when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,,died at the Cincinnati zoo.,This had been the most abundant bird in the world,that'd been in North America for six million years.,Suddenly it wasn't here at all.,Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long,used to darken the sun.,Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,,a feathered tempest.,And indeed it was a keystone species,that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,,from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,,from Canada down to the Gulf.,But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.,What happened? 
 Well, commercial hunting happened.,These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,,and it was easy to do because when those big flocks,came down to the ground, they were so dense,that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up,and slaughter them by the tens of thousands.,It was the cheapest source of protein in America.,By the end of the century, there was nothing left,but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. 
 There's an upside to the story.,This made people realize that the same thing,was about to happen to the American bison,,and so these birds saved the buffalos. 
 But a lot of other animals weren't saved.,The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.,It was hunted to death for its feathers.,There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.,It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.,A local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,,there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again.",There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,,and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.,It happened to lots of mammals.,Another keystone species is a famous animal,called the European aurochs.,There was sort of a movie made about it recently.,And the aurochs was like the bison.,This was an animal that basically kept the forest,mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,,from Spain to Korea.,The documentation of this animal goes back,to the Lascaux cave paintings. 
 The extinctions still go on.,There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.,It went extinct in 2000.,There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf,called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,,called the Tasmanian tiger.,It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.,A little bit of film was shot. 
 Sorrow, anger, mourning.,Don't mourn. Organize.,What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,,fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old,could be used to bring species back,,what would you do? Where would you start? 
 Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.,I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,,who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,,and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,,one of the leading genetic engineers,who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons,and a lot of confidence,that methodologies he was working on,might actually do the deed. 
 So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting,at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together,specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,,and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced,by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.,All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian,was a little bit of toe pad tissue,,because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.,It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,,but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome. 
 Then the question is, can you reassemble,,with that genome, the whole bird?,George Church thinks you can.,So in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,,he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,,and he has a machine called,the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.,It's kind of like an evolution machine.,You try combinations of genes that you write,at the cell level and then in organs on a chip,,and the ones that win, that you can then put,into a living organism. It'll work.,The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,,nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here,right down to the individual base pair.,The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome. 
 So what you're getting is the capability now,of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.,It's called an allele.,Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.,So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome,of an extinct species,with the genome of its closest living relative.,Now along the way, George points out that,his technology, the technology of synthetic biology,,is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.,It's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue. 
 Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon,is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.,Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is,mostly living passenger pigeon.,There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.,If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,,you've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you. 
 Now, there's work to do.,You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.,So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,,genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,,and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.,Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.,But it should be be perfect enough,,because nature doesn't do perfect either. 
 So this meeting in Boston led to three things. 
 First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit,called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally,and try to have it go in a responsible way,,and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon. 
 Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,,who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14,and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,,himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,,using money from his family and friends.,We hired him full-time.,Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,,he's looking down at Martha,,the last passenger pigeon alive.,So if he's successful, she won't be the last. 
 The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization,that there are scientists all over the world,working on various forms of de-extinction,,but they'd never met each other.,And National Geographic got interested,because National Geographic has the theory that,the last century, discovery was basically finding things,,and in this century, discovery is basically making things.,De-extinction falls in that category.,So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,,they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,,basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.,Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.,There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,,they're recreating extinct ecosystems,in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii. 
 Henri, from the Netherlands,,with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,,is working on the aurochs.,The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,,and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.,So what they're doing is working with seven breeds,of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there,to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,,the aurochs.,Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea,than it is in America,,and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,,they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,,its old ecological role,,of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest,so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it. 
 Another amazing story,came from Alberto Fernández-Arias.,Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.,The last bucardo was a female named Celia,who was still alive, but then they captured her,,they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,,they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,,released her back into the wild,,but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.,They took the DNA from that ear,,they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,,the pregnancy came to term,,and a live baby bucardo was born.,It was the first de-extinction in history. 
 (Applause) 
 It was short-lived.,Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.,This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,,but Alberto was confident that,cloning has moved along well since then,,and this will move ahead, and eventually,there will be a population of bucardos,back in the mountains in northern Spain. 
 Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.,At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo,has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species,over the last 35 years.,Now, when it's frozen that deep,,minus 196 degrees Celsius,,the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.,They're basically viable cells,,so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology,took some of that tissue from an endangered animal,called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,,the cow went to term, and what was born,was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,,who thrived and is still alive. 
 The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza,is the ability now to take any kind of cell,with induced pluripotent stem cells,and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs. 
 So now we go to Mike McGrew,who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,,and Mike's doing miracles with birds.,So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,,turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.,Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.,He then has a way to put the germ plasm,into the embryo of a chicken egg,so that that chicken will have, basically,,the gonads of a falcon.,You get a male and a female each of those,,and out of them comes falcons.,(Laughter),Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens. 
 Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.,He showed how all of this can be put together.,The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes,of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,,he'll take the techniques of George Church,and get passenger pigeon DNA,,the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,,get that DNA into chicken gonads,,and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,,and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. 
 It does raise the question of,,they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents,to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.,So what do you do about that?,Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,,so most of that is already in their DNA,,but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea,is to use homing pigeons,to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock,and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds,and feeding grounds. 
 There were some conservationists,,really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,,who is one of the founders of conservation biology,,and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.,They're excited about all this,,but they're also concerned that it might be competitive,with the extremely important efforts to protect,endangered species that are still alive,,that haven't gone extinct yet.,You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.,You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down,so you're not using 25,000 elephants a year. 
 But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing,that bad news bums people out.,And so the Red List is really important, keep track of,what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.,But they're about to create what they call a Green List,,and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,,species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,,but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,,and protected areas around the world,that are very, very well managed.,So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.,And they see reviving extinct species,as the kind of good news you might be able to build on. 
 Here's a couple related examples.,Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.,The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.,Everybody thought is was finished.,Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,,there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.,That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.,Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.,In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.,There were just 254 left.,Now there are 880. They're increasing in population,by three percent a year.,The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,,which is absolutely brilliant.,So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan,with an iPhone.,That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. 
 Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help,,is the northern white rhinoceros.,There's no breeding pairs left.,But this is the kind of thing that,a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.,A bit of cloning, you can get them back. 
 So where do we go from here?,These have been private meetings so far.,I think it's time for the subject to go public.,What do people think about it?,You know, do you want extinct species back?,Do you want extinct species back? 
 (Applause) 
 Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.,It is a Tinker Bell moment,,because what are people excited about with this?,What are they concerned about? 
 We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.,So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group,that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.,They're going to work on the genomes,of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.,As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,,who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.,We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew,to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens,that can produce passenger pigeon squabs,that can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,,and then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,,maybe for the next six million years.,You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,,for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,,for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,,for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,,for the woolly mammoth. 
 Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole,in nature in the last 10,000 years.,We have the ability now,,and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.,Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,,by expanding and protecting,the populations of endangered species.,But some species,that we killed off totally,we could consider bringing back,to a world that misses them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you.,I've got a question.,So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.,I suspect there are some people out there sitting,,kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,,well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,,there's something wrong with mankind,interfering in nature in this way.,There's going to be unintended consequences.,You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box,of who-knows-what. Do they have a point? 
 Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is,we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,,and many of them were keystone species,,and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in,by letting them go.,Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,,so when these things come back,,they might replace some birds that are there,that people really know and love.,I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.,This is a long, slow process --,One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.,We will get woolly mammoths back. 
 CA: Well it feels like both the conversation,and the potential here are pretty thrilling.,Thank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you. 
 CA: Thank you. (Applause)What is going to be the future of learning? 
 I do have a plan,,but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,,I need to tell you a little story,,which kind of sets the stage. 
 I tried to look at,where did the kind of learning we do in schools,,where did it come from?,And you can look far back into the past,,but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,,it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.,It came from about 300 years ago,,and it came from the last,and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"],Imagine trying to run the show,,trying to run the entire planet,,without computers, without telephones,,with data handwritten on pieces of paper,,and traveling by ships.,But the Victorians actually did it.,What they did was amazing.,They created a global computer,made up of people.,It's still with us today.,It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.,In order to have that machine running,,you need lots and lots of people.,They made another machine to produce those people:,the school.,The schools would produce the people,who would then become parts of the,bureaucratic administrative machine.,They must be identical to each other.,They must know three things:,They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;,they must be able to read;,and they must be able to do multiplication,,division, addition and subtraction in their head.,They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand,and ship them to Canada,and he would be instantly functional.,The Victorians were great engineers.,They engineered a system that was so robust,that it's still with us today,,continuously producing identical people,for a machine that no longer exists.,The empire is gone,,so what are we doing with that design,that produces these identical people,,and what are we going to do next,if we ever are going to do anything else with it? 
 ["Schools as we know them are obsolete"] 
 So that's a pretty strong comment there.,I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.,I'm not saying they're broken.,It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.,It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.,It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.,What are the kind of jobs that we have today?,Well, the clerks are the computers.,They're there in thousands in every office.,And you have people who guide those computers,to do their clerical jobs.,Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.,They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.,They do need to be able to read.,In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly. 
 Well, that's today, but we don't even know,what the jobs of the future are going to look like.,We know that people will work from wherever they want,,whenever they want, in whatever way they want.,How is present-day schooling going to prepare them,for that world? 
 Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.,I used to teach people how to write computer programs,in New Delhi, 14 years ago.,And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.,And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids,ever going to learn to write computer programs?,Or should they not?,At the same time, we also had lots of parents,,rich people, who had computers,,and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,,I think he's gifted,,because he does wonderful things with computers.,And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent.",And so on. So I suddenly figured that,,how come all the rich people are having,these extraordinarily gifted children?,(Laughter),What did the poor do wrong?,I made a hole in the boundary wall,of the slum next to my office,,and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen,if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,,didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was. 
 The children came running in.,It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?" 
 And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know.",(Laughter) 
 They said, "Why have you put it there?" 
 I said, "Just like that." 
 And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to." 
 And I went away.,About eight hours later,,we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.,So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --,How is it possible? They don't know anything." 
 My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.,One of your students must have been passing by,,showed them how to use the mouse." 
 So I said, "Yeah, that's possible." 
 So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi,into a really remote village,where the chances of a passing software development engineer,was very little. (Laughter),I repeated the experiment there.,There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,,I went away, came back after a couple of months,,found kids playing games on it. 
 When they saw me, they said,,"We want a faster processor and a better mouse." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?" 
 And they said something very interesting to me.,In an irritated voice, they said,,"You've given us a machine that works only in English,,so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter),That's the first time, as a teacher,,that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually. 
 Here's a short glimpse from those years.,That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.,On your right is an eight-year-old.,To his left is his student. She's six.,And he's teaching her how to browse.,Then onto other parts of the country,,I repeated this over and over again,,getting exactly the same results that we were.,["Hole in the wall film - 1999"],An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.,And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,,and said, "There's a processor inside." 
 So I started publishing.,I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,,and I said, in nine months, a group of children,left alone with a computer in any language,will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.,I'd seen it happen over and over and over again. 
 But I was curious to know, what else would they do,if they could do this much?,I started experimenting with other subjects,,among them, for example, pronunciation.,There's one community of children in southern India,whose English pronunciation is really bad,,and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.,I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,,and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say.",(Laughter),They did that, and watch a little bit of this. 
 Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you. 
 Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face,of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.,She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad,and may have tortured you about your credit card bills,in a very clear English accent. 
 So then people said, well, how far will it go?,Where does it stop?,I decided I would destroy my own argument,by creating an absurd proposition.,I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.,Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,,can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village,learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English,from a streetside computer?,And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.,I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,,I'll go back, they'll get another zero.,I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.,I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.,I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,,downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,,most of which I didn't understand. 
 The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?" 
 So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English." 
 So they said, "How can we understand such big English words,and diagrams and chemistry?" 
 So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,,so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea.",(Laughter),"And anyway, I am going away.",(Laughter) 
 So I left them for a couple of months.,They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.,I came back after two months,and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing." 
 So I said, "Well, what did I expect?",So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you,before you decided that you can't understand anything?" 
 So they said, "We haven't given up.,We look at it every single day." 
 So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens,and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?" 
 So a little girl who you see just now,,she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,,she said, "Well, apart from the fact that,improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,,we haven't understood anything else." 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 So I tested them.,I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent,in two months in the tropical heat,with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know,doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.,Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.,Thirty percent is a fail.,How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.,I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,,a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant,and she played with them all the time. 
 So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?" 
 So she says, "Absolutely not.,I didn't have science in school. I have no idea,what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you." 
 I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother." 
 So she says, "What's that?" 
 I said, "Stand behind them.,Whenever they do anything, you just say,,'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?,What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.',You know what grannies do." 
 So she did that for two more months.,The scores jumped to 50 percent.,Kallikuppam had caught up,with my control school in New Delhi,,a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.,When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field. 
 Here's Kallikuppam. 
 (Children speaking) Neurons ... communication. 
 I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,,but what she was saying, as you could make out,,was about neurons, with her hands were like that,,and she was saying neurons communicate.,At 12. 
 So what are jobs going to be like?,Well, we know what they're like today.,What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,,children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand,and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand. 
 What will it be tomorrow?,Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?,Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,,you can find out in two minutes?,Could it be -- a devastating question,,a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --,could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in,a future where knowing is obsolete?,But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.,Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.,But look at it this way.,It took nature 100 million years,to make the ape stand up,and become Homo sapiens.,It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.,What an achievement that is.,But we have to integrate that into our own future. 
 Encouragement seems to be the key.,If you look at Kuppam,,if you look at all of the experiments that I did,,it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning. 
 There is evidence from neuroscience.,The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,,when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,,it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,,it shuts all of that down.,Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.,We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,,and then we say, "Perform.",Why did they create a system like that?,Because it was needed.,There was an age in the Age of Empires,when you needed those people who can survive under threat.,When you're standing in a trench all alone,,if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.,If you didn't, you failed.,But the Age of Empires is gone.,What happens to creativity in our age?,We need to shift that balance back,from threat to pleasure. 
 I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.,I put out notices in papers saying,,if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,,can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?,I got 200 in the first two weeks.,I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter),They're called the Granny Cloud.,The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.,If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.,She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.,I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles,in northwestern England,,deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,,6,000 miles away.,She does it with only one age-old gesture.,"Shhh.",Okay? 
 Watch this. 
 Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.,You can't catch me. 
 Children: You can't catch me. 
 Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man. 
 Grandmother: Well done! Very good. 
 SM: So what's happening here?,I think what we need to look at is,we need to look at learning,as the product of educational self-organization.,If you allow the educational process to self-organize,,then learning emerges.,It's not about making learning happen.,It's about letting it happen.,The teacher sets the process in motion,and then she stands back in awe,and watches as learning happens.,I think that's what all this is pointing at. 
 But how will we know? How will we come to know?,Well, I intend to build,these Self-Organized Learning Environments.,They are basically broadband, collaboration,and encouragement put together.,I've tried this in many, many schools. 
 It's been tried all over the world, and teachers,sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?" 
 And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?" 
 I said, "You won't believe the children who told me,and where they're from." 
 Here's a SOLE in action. 
 (Children talking) 
 This one is in England.,He maintains law and order,,because remember, there's no teacher around. 
 Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia,Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.,The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons,in the ion minus the number of electrons. 
 SM: A decade ahead of her time. 
 So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.,You already heard about that. You know what that means.,There was a time when Stone Age men and women,used to sit and look up at the sky and say,,"What are those twinkling lights?",They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.,We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.,But that's not sexy enough.,The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,,"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,,how would you figure out if it was going to or not?",And if he says, "Well, what? how?",you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,",and leave him alone. He'll figure it out. 
 So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.,I've tried incredible, incredible questions --,"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —,to nine-year-olds.,This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.,This is done by children without the help of any teacher.,The teacher only raises the question,,and then stands back and admires the answer. 
 So what's my wish?,My wish is,that we design the future of learning.,We don't want to be spare parts,for a great human computer, do we?,So we need to design a future for learning.,And I've got to -- hang on,,I've got to get this wording exactly right,,because, you know, it's very important.,My wish is to help design a future of learning,by supporting children all over the world,to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.,Help me build this school.,It will be called the School in the Cloud.,It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures,driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.,The way I want to do this,is to build a facility where I can study this.,It's a facility which is practically unmanned.,There's only one granny,who manages health and safety.,The rest of it's from the cloud.,The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,,etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud. 
 But I want you for another purpose.,You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments,at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.,It's very easy to do. There's a great document,produced by TED which tells you how to do it.,If you would please, please do it,across all five continents,and send me the data,,then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,,and create the future of learning.,That's my wish. 
 And just one last thing.,I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.,At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,,I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,,and the children flocked there.,And there was this little girl who was following me around. 
 And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.,I don't know, what should I do?",And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly. 
 She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,,"Get on with it." 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 I think it was good advice.,I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.,Thank you. Thank you very much.,(Applause),Thank you. Thank you. (Applause),Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)Ah yes, those university days,,a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics,and world debating championships,,or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah.",Didn't get much sexier than the Spence,at university, let me tell you. 
 It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer,from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage,literally on the other side of the world.,And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard,about Australians are true.,From the youngest of ages, we display,a prodigious sporting talent.,On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.,What you've heard is true.,Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,,sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter),This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.,I'm almost five years old. Fair to say,,I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was. 
 But I stand before you today,not as a breakfast radio host,,not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,,and always will be a mathematician.,And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug,knows that it bites early and it bites deep. 
 I cast my mind back when I was in second grade,at a beautiful little government-run school,called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,,and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,,Ms. Russell, said to the class,,"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?,I've got no plans.",It was an exercise in democratic schooling,,and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.,So some of the suggestions we made as to what,we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,,and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion,and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,,"That wouldn't work.,That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole." 
 Now I wasn't trying to be smart.,I wasn't trying to be funny.,I just politely raised my hand,,and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,,in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,,"But Miss,,surely if the diagonal of the square,is less than the diameter of the circle,,well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole.",(Laughter),"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?" 
 And there was that same awkward silence,from most of my classmates,,until sitting next to me, one of my friends,,one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across,and punched me really hard in the head.,(Laughter),Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,,you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.,You can keep sitting here with us.,Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit,over there with them." 
 I thought about it for a nanosecond.,I took one look at the road map of life,,and I ran off down the street marked "Geek",as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me. 
 I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.,I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.,It's natural. It's everywhere.,Numbers are the musical notes,with which the symphony of the universe is written.,The great Descartes said something quite similar.,The universe "is written in the mathematical language.",And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,,a number so beautiful, so massive,,I think it will blow your mind. 
 Today we're going to talk about prime numbers.,Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime,because it's 2 x 3.,Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7,,but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,,or as we call them, factors.,Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.,One is not prime.,The proof of that is a great party trick,that admittedly only works at certain parties. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.,They keep going on forever.,We know there are an infinite number of primes,due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.,Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.,But the third thing about prime numbers,,mathematicians have always wondered,,well at any given moment in time,,what is the biggest prime that we know about? 
 Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime.,Don't freak out.,All you need to know, of all the mathematics,you've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,,never understood in the first place,,all you need to know is this:,When I say 2 ^ 5,,I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other,all multiplied together,,2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.,So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,,8, 16, 32.,If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?,So 2 ^ 5,,those five little twos multiplied together.,(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.,31 is a prime number, and that five in the power,is also a prime number.,And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found,are of that form:,two to a prime number, take away one.,I won't go into great detail as to why,,because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,,but suffice to say, a number of that form,is fairly easy to test for primacy.,A random odd number is a lot harder to test.,But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,,we realize it's not enough,just to put in any prime number in the power.,(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,,and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.,(Laughter),But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1,(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.,After that point, they thin out a lot. 
 And one of the things about the search for massive primes,that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds,of all time have gone on this search.,This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.,In the 1700s, other mathematicians said,he is simply the master of us all.,He was so respected, they put him on European currency,back when that was a compliment. 
 (Laughter) 
 Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:,(2 ^ 31) - 1.,It's over two billion.,He proved it was prime with nothing more,than a quill, ink, paper and his mind. 
 You think that's big.,We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1,is a prime number.,It's an absolute brute.,Look at it here: 39 digits long,,proven to be prime in 1876,by a mathematician called Lucas.,Word up, L-Dog. 
 (Laughter) 
 But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,,it's not just finding the primes.,Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.,Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,,21 digits long, was not prime.,But he didn't know what the factors were.,We knew it was like six, but we didn't know,what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together,to give us that massive number. 
 We didn't know for almost 40 years,until Frank Nelson Cole came along.,And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,,he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,,and started writing out the powers of two:,two, four, eight, 16 --,come on, join in with me, you know how it goes --,32, 64, 128, 256,,512, 1,024, 2,048.,I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.,Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there.,He went on and on,and calculated 67 powers of two.,He took away one and wrote that number on the board.,A frisson of excitement went around the room.,It got even more exciting when he then wrote down,these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format --,and for the rest of the hour of his talk,Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.,He had found the prime factors,of (2 ^ 67) - 1.,The room went berserk --,(Laughter) --,as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,,having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics,with no words.,He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.,It took focus. It took dedication.,It took him, by his estimate,,"three years of Sundays." 
 But then in the field of mathematics,,as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,,the age of the computer goes along and things explode.,These are the largest prime numbers we knew,decade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before,as computers took over and our power to calculate,just grew and grew. 
 This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,,a very emotional year for me.,It was the year I left university.,I was torn between mathematics and media.,It was a tough decision. I loved university.,My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I came to a realization about my own ability.,Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,,I'm a maths genius.,In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,,I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.,My skill is not in the mathematics.,It is in telling the story of the mathematics. 
 And during that time, since I've left university,,these numbers have got bigger and bigger,,each one dwarfing the last,,until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,,who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,,only to see it snatched away by a rival university.,And then Curtis Cooper got it back.,Not years ago, not months ago, days ago.,In an amazing moment of serendipity,,I had to send TED a new slide,to show you what this guy had done. 
 I still remember -- (Applause) --,I still remember when it happened.,I was doing my breakfast radio show.,I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:,"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?",I shivered --,(Laughter) --,contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,,and said "Girls, hold the front page.,We're not talking politics today.,We're not talking sport today.,They found another megaprime.",The girls just shook their heads,,put them in their hands, and let me go my own way. 
 It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,,currently the largest prime number we know,,is 2 ^ 57,885,161.,Don't forget to subtract the one.,This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.,If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,,that's 22 meg.,For the slightly less geeky of you,,think about the Harry Potter novels, okay?,This is the first Harry Potter novel.,This is all seven Harry Potter novels,,because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.,(Laughter),Written out as a book, this number would run,the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.,Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.,If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,,we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,,it would have taken five hours to show you that number.,I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.,That's the way it goes. 
 This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,,and we know it is prime as confidently,as we know the number seven is prime.,That fills me with almost sexual excitement.,And who am I kidding when I say almost? 
 (Laughter) 
 I know what you're thinking:,Adam, we're happy that you're happy,,but why should we care?,Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful. 
 First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer,"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,,and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,,is a remarkably simple question to ask.,It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,,and just requires phenomenal grunt.,Large prime numbers are a great way of testing,the speed and accuracy of computer chips. 
 But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,,he wasn't the only guy searching.,My laptop at home was looking through,four potential candidate primes myself,as part of a networked computer hunt around the world,for these large numbers.,The discovery of that prime is similar to the work,people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,,in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.,We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs,are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia,but on laptops, desktops,,in the palms of people's hands,who are simply helping out for the search. 
 But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor,for the time in which we live,,when human minds and machines can conquer together.,We've heard a lot about robots in this TED.,We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.,It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone,an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess. 
 You think that's cool.,Here's a machine doing something cool.,This is the CubeStormer II.,It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.,Using the power of the smartphone,,it can examine the cube and solve the cube,in five seconds. 
 (Applause) 
 That scares some people. That excites me.,How lucky are we to live in this age,when mind and machine can work together? 
 I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity,as a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,,"What was your highlight of 2012?",People were expecting me to talk about,my beloved Sydney Swans football team.,In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,,they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.,I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.,It wasn't my highlight of 2012.,People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.,It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.,It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.,It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.,No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,,was the discovery of the Higgs boson.,Give it up for the fundamental particle,that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass. 
 (Applause) 
 And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was,50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team,considered one of the deepest of all questions:,How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?,I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?,And he postulated a suggestion,that there's this infinite, incredibly small field,stretching throughout the universe,,and as other particles go through those particles,and interact, that's where they get their mass.,The rest of the scientific community said,,"Great idea, Higgsy.,We've got no idea if we could ever prove it.,It's beyond our reach.",And within just 50 years,,in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,,we had designed the greatest machine ever,to prove this incredible idea,that originated just in a human mind. 
 That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.,We thought it might be there,,and we went and found it.,That is the essence of being human.,That is what we are all about.,Or as my friend Descartes might put it,,we think,,therefore we are. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I work with children with autism.,Specifically, I make technologies,to help them communicate. 
 Now, many of the problems that children,with autism face, they have a common source,,and that source is that they find it difficult,to understand abstraction, symbolism.,And because of this, they have na lot of difficulty with language. 
 Let me tell you a little bit about why this is.,You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.,All of us can see it. All of us understand this.,These are two other pictures of soup,,but you can see that these are more abstract,These are not quite as concrete.,And when you get to language,,you see that it becomes a word,whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,,has absolutely nothing to do nwith what it started with,,or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.,So it's essentially a completely abstract,,a completely arbitrary representation of something,which is in the real world,,and this is something that children with autism,have an incredible amount of difficulty with.,Now that's why most of the people nthat work with children with autism --,speech therapists, educators --,what they do is, they try to help children with autism,communicate not with words, but with pictures.,So if a child with autism wanted to say,,"I want soup," that child would pick,three different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup,",and they would put these together,,and then the therapist or the parent would,understand that this is what the kid wants to say.,And this has been incredibly effective;,for the last 30, 40 years,people have been doing this.,In fact, a few years back,,I developed an app for the iPad,which does exactly this. It's called Avaz,,and the way it works is that kids select,different pictures.,These pictures are sequencedntogether to form sentences,,and these sentences are spoken out.,So Avaz is essentially converting pictures,,it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech. 
 Now, this was very effective.,There are thousands of children using this,,you know, all over the world,,and I started thinking about,what it does and what it doesn't do.,And I realized something interesting:,Avaz helps children with autism learn words.,What it doesn't help them do is to learn,word patterns.,Let me explain this in a little more detail.,Take this sentence: "I want soup tonight.",Now it's not just the wordsnhere that convey the meaning.,It's also the way in which these words are arranged,,the way these words are modified and arranged.,And that's why a sentence like "I want soup tonight",is different from a sentence like,"Soup want I tonight," which nis completely meaningless.,So there is another hidden abstraction here,which children with autism findna lot of difficulty coping with,,and that's the fact that you can modify words,and you can arrange them to have,different meanings, to convey different ideas.,Now, this is what we call grammar.,And grammar is incredibly powerful,,because grammar is this one component of language,which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have,and allows us to convey anninfinite amount of information,,an infinite amount of ideas.,It's the way in which you can put things together,in order to convey anything you want to. 
 And so after I developed Avaz,,I worried for a very long time,about how I could give grammar nto children with autism.,The solution came to me fromna very interesting perspective.,I happened to chance upon a child with autism,conversing with her mom,,and this is what happened.,Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously,,the child got up and said, "Eat.",Now what was interesting was,the way in which the mom was trying to tease out,the meaning of what the child wanted to say,by talking to her in questions.,So she asked, "Eat what? Do nyou want to eat ice cream?,You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?,You want to eat cream now? Younwant to eat ice cream in the evening?",And then it struck me that,what the mother had done was something incredible.,She had been able to get that child to communicate,an idea to her without grammar.,And it struck me that maybe this is what,I was looking for.,Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,,as a sentence, you arrange them,in this map, where they're all linked together,not by placing them one after the other,but in questions, in question-answer pairs.,And so if you do this, then what you're conveying,is not a sentence in English,,but what you're conveying is really a meaning,,the meaning of a sentence in English.,Now, meaning is really the underbelly,nin some sense, of language.,It's what comes after thought but before language.,And the idea was that this particular representation,might convey meaning in its raw form. 
 So I was very excited by this, you know,,hopping around all over the place,,trying to figure out if I can convert,all possible sentences that I hear into this.,And I found that this is not enough.,Why is this not enough?,This is not enough because if you wanted to convey,something like negation,,you want to say, "I don't want soup,",then you can't do that by asking a question.,You do that by changing the word "want.",Again, if you wanted to say,,"I wanted soup yesterday,",you do that by convertingnthe word "want" into "wanted.",It's a past tense.,So this is a flourish which I added,to make the system complete.,This is a map of words joined together,as questions and answers,,and with these filters applied on top of them,in order to modify them to represent,certain nuances.,Let me show you this with a different example. 
 Let's take this sentence:,"I told the carpenter I could not pay him.",It's a fairly complicated sentence.,The way that this particular system works,,you can start with any part of this sentence.,I'm going to start with the word "tell.",So this is the word "tell.",Now this happened in the past,,so I'm going to make that "told.",Now, what I'm going to do is,,I'm going to ask questions.,So, who told? I told.,I told whom? I told the carpenter.,Now we start with a different part of the sentence.,We start with the word "pay,",and we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay.",Then we make it "can't pay,",and we can make it "couldn't pay",by making it the past tense.,So who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.,Couldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.,And then you join these two together,by asking this question:,What did I tell the carpenter?,I told the carpenter I could not pay him. 
 Now think about this. This is,—(Applause)—,this is a representation of this sentence,without language.,And there are two or threeninteresting things about this.,First of all, I could have started anywhere.,I didn't have to start with the word "tell.",I could have started anywhere in the sentence,,and I could have made this entire thing.,The second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,,if I was speaking in some other language,,this map would actually hold true in any language.,So long as the questions are standardized,,the map is actually independent of language.,So I call this FreeSpeech,,and I was playing with this for many, many months.,I was trying out so manyndifferent combinations of this. 
 And then I noticed something veryninteresting about FreeSpeech.,I was trying to convert language,,convert sentences in Englishninto sentences in FreeSpeech,,and vice versa, and back and forth.,And I realized that this particular configuration,,this particular way of representing language,,it allowed me to actually create very concise rules,that go between FreeSpeech on one side,and English on the other.,So I could actually write this set of rules,that translates from this particularnrepresentation into English.,And so I developed this thing.,I developed this thing called nthe FreeSpeech Engine,which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input,and gives out perfectly grammatical English text.,And by putting these two pieces together,,the representation and the engine,,I was able to create an app, antechnology for children with autism,,that not only gives them words,but also gives them grammar. 
 So I tried this out with kids with autism,,and I found that there was an nincredible amount of identification.,They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech,which were much more complicatednbut much more effective,than equivalent sentences in English,,and I started thinking about,why that might be the case.,And I had an idea, and I want to ntalk to you about this idea next.,In about 1997, about 15 years back,,there were a group of scientists that were trying,to understand how the brain processes language,,and they found something very interesting.,They found that when you learn a language,as a child, as a two-year-old,,you learn it with a certain part of your brain,,and when you learn a language as an adult --,for example, if I wanted tonlearn Japanese right now —,a completely different part of my brain is used.,Now I don't know why that's the case,,but my guess is that that's because,when you learn a language as an adult,,you almost invariably learn it,through your native language, ornthrough your first language.,So what's interesting about FreeSpeech,is that when you create a sentence,or when you create language,,a child with autism createsnlanguage with FreeSpeech,,they're not using this support language,,they're not using this bridge language.,They're directly constructing the sentence. 
 And so this gave me this idea.,Is it possible to use FreeSpeech,not for children with autism,but to teach language to people without disabilities?,And so I tried a number of experiments.,The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle,in which these questions and answers,are coded in the form of shapes,,in the form of colors,,and you have people putting these together,and trying to understand how this works.,And I built an app out of it, a game out of it,,in which children can play with words,and with a reinforcement,,a sound reinforcement of visual structures,,they're able to learn language.,And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,,and the government of India recently,licensed this technology from us,,and they're going to try it outnwith millions of different children,trying to teach them English.,And the dream, the hope, the vision, really,,is that when they learn English this way,,they learn it with the same proficiency,as their mother tongue. 
 All right, let's talk about something else.,Let's talk about speech.,This is speech.,So speech is the primary mode of communication,delivered between all of us.,Now what's interesting about speech is that,speech is one-dimensional.,Why is it one-dimensional?,It's one-dimensional because it's sound.,It's also one-dimensional because,our mouths are built that way.,Our mouths are built to createnone-dimensional sound.,But if you think about the brain,,the thoughts that we have in our heads,are not one-dimensional.,I mean, we have these rich,,complicated, multi-dimensional ideas.,Now, it seems to me that language,is really the brain's invention,to convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought,on one hand,into speech on the other hand.,Now what's interesting is that,we do a lot of work in information nowadays,,and almost all of that is donenin the language domain.,Take Google, for example.,Google trawls all thesencountless billions of websites,,all of which are in English,nand when you want to use Google,,you go into Google search, and you type in English,,and it matches the English with the English.,What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?,I have a suspicion that if we did this,,we'd find that algorithms like searching,,like retrieval, all of these things,,are much simpler and also more effective,,because they don't processnthe data structure of speech.,Instead they're processingnthe data structure of thought.,The data structure of thought.,That's a provocative idea. 
 But let's look at this in a little more detail.,So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.,We have the Free Speechnrepresentation on one side,,and we have the FreeSpeech nEngine, which generates English.,Now if you think about it,,FreeSpeech, I told you, is completely nlanguage-independent.,It doesn't have any specific information in it,which is about English.,So everything that this system knows about English,is actually encoded into the engine.,That's a pretty interesting concept in itself.,You've encoded an entire human language,into a software program.,But if you look at what's inside the engine,,it's actually not very complicated.,It's not very complicated code.,And what's more interesting is the fact that,the vast majority of the code in that engine,is not really English-specific.,And that gives this interesting idea.,It might be very easy for us to actually,create these engines in many,nmany different languages,,in Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.,And that gives another interesting idea.,For example, supposing I was a writer,,say, for a newspaper or for a magazine.,I could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,,and the person who's consuming that content,,the person who's reading that particular information,could choose any engine,,and they could read it in their own mother tongue,,in their native language.,I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,,especially for India.,We have so many different languages.,There's a song about India, and there's a description,of the country as, it says,,(in Sanskrit).,That means "ever-smiling speaker,of beautiful languages." 
 Language is beautiful.,I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.,I think it's the loveliest thingnthat our brains have invented.,It entertains, it educates, it enlightens,,but what I like the most about language,is that it empowers. 
 I want to leave you with this.,This is a photograph of my collaborators,,my earliest collaborators,when I started working on language,and autism and various other things.,The girl's name is Pavna,,and that's her mother, Kalpana.,And Pavna's an entrepreneur,,but her story is much more remarkable than mine,,because Pavna is about 23.,She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,,so ever since she was born,,she could neither move nor talk.,And everything that she's accomplished so far,,finishing school, going to college,,starting a company,,collaborating with me to develop Avaz,,all of these things she's done,with nothing more than moving her eyes. 
 Daniel Webster said this:,He said, "If all of my possessions were taken,from me with one exception,,I would choose to keep the power of communication,,for with it, I would regain all the rest.",And that's why, of all of these incredible napplications of FreeSpeech,,the one that's closest to my heart,still remains the ability for this,to empower children with disabilities,to be able to communicate,,the power of communication,,to get back all the rest. 
 Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you. (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)When we use the word "architect" or "designer,",what we usually mean is a professional,,someone who gets paid,,and we tend to assume that it's those professionals,who are going to be the ones to help us solve,the really big, systemic design challenges that we face,like climate change, urbanization and social inequality.,That's our kind of working presumption.,And I think it's wrong, actually. 
 In 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school,after several years, and go out and get a job,,and this happened.,The economy ran out of jobs.,And a couple of things struck me about this.,One, don't listen to career advisers.,And two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,,which is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,,and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.,It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,,but actually there's an economics behind architecture,that we don't talk about, and I think we need to. 
 And a good place to start is your own paycheck.,So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,,I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.,That's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.,Now in terms of the whole world's population,,that already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,,which raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?,The uncomfortable fact is that,actually almost everything that we call architecture today,is actually the business of designing,for about the richest one percent of the world's population,,and it always has been.,The reason why we forgot that,is because the times in history when architecture,did the most to transform society were those times,when, actually, the one percent would build,on behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,,whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,,communism in the early 20th,,the welfare state, and most recently, of course,,through this inflated real estate bubble.,And all of those booms, in their own various ways,,have now kicked the bucket,,and we're back in this situation,where the smartest designers and architects in the world,are only really able to work for one percent of the population. 
 Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy,,though I think it probably is,,it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.,I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects,is, how are we going to turn our client,from the one percent to the 100 percent?,And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas,for how it might be done. 
 The first is, I think we need to question this idea,that architecture is about making buildings.,Actually, a building is about the most expensive solution,you can think of to almost any given problem.,And fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested,in solving problems and creating new conditions.,So here's a story.,The office was working with a school,,and they had an old Victorian school building. 
 And they said to the architects, "Look,,our corridors are an absolute nightmare.,They're far too small. They get congested between classes.,There's bullying. We can't control them.,So what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,,and we know it's going to cost several million pounds,,but we're reconciled to the fact." 
 And the team thought about this, and they went away,,and they said, "Actually, don't do that.,Instead, get rid of the school bell.,And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,,have several smaller school bells that go off,in different places and different times,,distribute the traffic through the corridors.",It solves the same problem,,but instead of spending several million pounds,,you spend several hundred pounds.,Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,,but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.,Architects are actually really, really good,at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.,And the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,,we got fixated on the idea of providing,a particular kind of consumer product,,and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore. 
 The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing,that mass architecture is about big --,big buildings and big finance.,Actually, we've got ourselves locked into this,Industrial Era mindset which says that,the only people who can make cities are large organizations,or corporations who build on our behalf,,procuring whole neighborhoods,in single, monolithic projects, and of course,,form follows finance.,So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods,based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.,And a lot of people can't even afford them.,But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities,to be made not just by the few with a lot,but also by the many with a bit?,And when they do, they bring with them,a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.,And it raises really interesting questions about,,how will we plan cities? How will finance development?,How will we sell design services?,What would it mean for democratic societies,to offer their citizens a right to build?,And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,,that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens. 
 And thirdly, we need to remember that,,from a strictly economic point of view,,design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly --,mostly it's done by amateurs.,And that's a good thing.,Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy,in what's called the social economy or the core economy,,which is people doing it for themselves.,And the problem is that, up until now,,it was the monetary economy which had,all the infrastructure and all the tools. 
 So the challenge we face is, how are we going,to build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions,for architecture's social economy?,And that began with open-source software.,And over the last few years, it's been moving,into the physical world with open-source hardware,,which are freely shared blueprints,that anyone can download and make for themselves.,And that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.,Right? When suddenly you had a 3D printer,that was open-source, the parts for which,could be made on another 3D printer.,Or the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,,which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.,What these technologies are doing is radically,lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.,They're challenging the idea that,if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.,And they're distributing massively,really complex manufacturing capabilities.,We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,,and increasingly that means,that the design team is everyone.,That really is an industrial revolution.,And when we think that the major ideological conflicts,that we inherited were all based around this question,of who should control the means of production,,and these technologies are coming back with a solution:,actually, maybe no one. All of us. 
 And we were fascinated by,what that might mean for architecture.,So about a year and a half ago,,we started working on a project called WikiHouse,,and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.,And the idea is to make it possible for anyone,to go online, access a freely shared library,of 3D models which they can download and adapt in,,at the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,,and almost at the click of a switch,they can generate a set of cutting files,which allow them, in effect,,to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine,and a standard sheet material like plywood.,And the parts are all numbered,,and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.,(Laughter),And it goes together without any bolts.,It uses wedge and peg connections.,And even the mallets to make it,can be provided on the cutting sheets as well.,And a team of about two or three people,,working together, can build this.,They don't need any traditional construction skills.,They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,,and they can build a small house of about this size,in about a day. 
 (Applause) 
 And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house,onto which you can then apply systems like windows,and cladding and insulation and services,based on what's cheap and what's available.,Of course, the house is never finished.,We're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.,With the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it,over its life or even use it to make the house next door.,So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,,citizen-led urban development model, potentially. 
 And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,,and some really interesting lessons here.,One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.,People get confused between construction work and having fun.,But the principles of openness go right down,into the really mundane, physical details.,Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.,Or, when you're designing a piece,,make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,,or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.,Probably the principal which runs deepest with us,is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,,the open-source pioneer,,which was that idea of, "Be lazy like a fox.",Don't reinvent the wheel every time.,Take what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.,Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught,at an architecture school, copying is good. 
 Which is appropriate, because actually,,this approach is not innovative.,It's actually how we built buildings,for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution,in these sorts of community barn-raisings.,The only difference between traditional,vernacular architecture and open-source architecture,might be a web connection,,but it's a really, really big difference.,We shared the whole of WikiHouse,under a Creative Commons license,,and now what's just beginning to happen,is that groups around the world are beginning to take it,and use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.,There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand,looking at post-earthquake development housing,,and thanks to the TED city Prize,,we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas,to set up a kind of community factory,and micro-university.,These are very, very small beginnings,,and actually there's more people in the last week,who have got in touch and they're not even on this map.,I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map. 
 We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,,but it's a small answer to a really, really big question,,which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities,are not skyscraper cities.,They're self-made cities in one form or another.,If we're talking about the 21st-century city,,these are the guys who are going to be making it.,You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team. 
 So if we're serious about problems,like climate change, urbanization and health,,actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.,As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank,or a corporation or a government or an NGO,who's going to be able to do it,if we treat citizens only as consumers.,How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively,we were to develop solutions not just to the problem,of structure that we've been working on,,but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,,off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation --,low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions,that anyone can very, very easily make,,and to put them all into a commons,where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?,A kind of Wikipedia for stuff?,And once something's in the commons,,it will always be there.,How much would that change the rules?,And I think the technology's on our side. 
 If design's great project in the 20th century,was the democratization of consumption --,that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA —,I think design's great project in the 21st century,is the democratization of production.,And when it comes to architecture in cities,,that really matters.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)(Breathes in) 
 (Breathes out) 
 So, I didn't always makenmy living from music.,For about the five years after graduating,from an upstandingnliberal arts university,,this was my day job. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was a self-employed livingnstatue called the Eight-Foot Bride,,and I love telling peoplenI did this for a job,,because everybody always wants to know,,who are these freaks in real life. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hello. 
 I painted myself whitenone day, stood on a box,,put a hat or a can at my feet,,and when someone came bynand dropped in money,,I handed them a flower --,and some intense eye contact.,And if they didn't take the flower,,I threw in a gesturenof sadness and longing --,as they walked away. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I had the most profoundnencounters with people,,especially lonely people,who looked like they hadn't talkednto anyone in weeks,,and we would get this beautiful momentnof prolonged eye contact,being allowed in a city street,,and we would sort of fallnin love a little bit.,And my eyes would say --,"Thank you.,I see you.",And their eyes would say --,"Nobody ever sees me.,Thank you." 
 I would get harassed sometimes.,People would yell at me from their cars.,"Get a job!",(Laughing) And I'd be, like,,"This is my job.",But it hurt, because it made me fear,that I was somehow doingnsomething un-joblike,and unfair, shameful.,I had no idea how perfectna real education I was getting,for the music business on this box.,And for the economists out there,,you may be interested to know I actuallynmade a pretty predictable income,,which was shocking to me,ngiven I had no regular customers,,but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,n90 bucks on a Friday.,It was consistent. 
 And meanwhile, I was touring locallynand playing in nightclubs,with my band, the Dresden Dolls.,This was me on piano, a genius drummer.,I wrote the songs, and eventually,we started making enough moneynthat I could quit being a statue,,and as we started touring,,I really didn't want to lose this sense,of direct connection with people,nbecause I loved it.,So after all of our shows,nwe would sign autographs,and hug fans and hang outnand talk to people,,and we made an art outnof asking people to help us and join us,,and I would track downnlocal musicians and artists,and they would set upnoutside of our shows,,and they would pass the hat,,and then they would come innand join us onstage,,so we had this rotating smorgasbordnof weird, random circus guests. 
 And then Twitter came along,,and made things even more magic,,because I could ask instantlynfor anything anywhere.,So I would need a piano to practice on,,and an hour later I would benat a fan's house.,This is in London.,People would bring home-cooked food to us,all over the world backstagenand feed us and eat with us.,This is in Seattle.,Fans who worked in museums and stores,and any kind of public spacenwould wave their hands,if I would decide to dona last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.,This is a library in Auckland.,On Saturday I tweetednfor this crate and hat,,because I did not want to schlep themnfrom the East Coast,,and they showed up care of this dude,nChris, from Newport Beach,,who says hello.,I once tweeted, "Where in Melbournencan I buy a neti pot?",And a nurse from a hospital drove one,right at that moment to the cafe I was in,,and I bought her a smoothie,and we sat there talkingnabout nursing and death. 
 And I love this kind of random closeness,,which is lucky, because I dona lot of couchsurfing.,In mansions where everyonenin my crew gets their own room,but there's no wireless,,and in punk squats,,everyone on the floornin one room with no toilets,but with wireless,nclearly making it the better option. 
 (Laughter) 
 My crew once pulled our vannup to a really poor Miami neighborhood,and we found out that our couchsurfingnhost for the night,was an 18-year-old girl,nstill living at home,,and her family were all undocumentednimmigrants from Honduras.,And that night, her whole family,took the couches and she sleptntogether with her mom,so that we could take their beds.,And I lay there thinking,,these people have so little.,Is this fair?,And in the morning,,her mom taught usnhow to try to make tortillas,and wanted to give me a Bible,,and she took me aside and she saidnto me in her broken English,,"Your music has helpednmy daughter so much.,Thank you for staying here.nWe're all so grateful.",And I thought, this is fair.,This is this. 
 A couple of months later,nI was in Manhattan,,and I tweeted for a crash pad,nand at midnight,,I'm on the Lower East Side,,and it occurs to me I've nevernactually done this alone.,I've always been with my band or my crew.,Is this what stupid people do? 
 (Laughter) 
 Is this how stupid people die?,And before I can change my mind,nthe door busts open.,She's an artist.,He's a financial blogger for Reuters,,and they're pouring me a glass of red wine,and offering me a bath,,and I have had thousands of nightsnlike that and like that. 
 So I couchsurf a lot.nI also crowdsurf a lot.,I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing,are basically the same thing.,You're falling into the audience,and you're trusting each other.,I once asked an opening band of mine,if they wanted to go outninto the crowd and pass the hat,to get some extra money,nsomething that I did a lot.,And as usual, the band was psyched,,but there was this one guy in the band,who told me he just couldn'tnbring himself to go out there.,It felt too much like beggingnto stand there with the hat.,And I recognized his fear,of "Is this fair?",and "Get a job." 
 And meanwhile, my bandnis becoming bigger and bigger.,We sign with a major label.,And our music is a crossnbetween punk and cabaret.,It's not for everybody.,Well, maybe it's for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 We sign, and there's all this hypenleading up to our next record.,And it comes out and it sellsnabout 25,000 copies,in the first few weeks,,and the label considers this a failure. 
 I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?" 
 They said, "No, the sales are going down.,It's a failure.",And they walk off. 
 Right at this same time,nI'm signing and hugging after a gig,,and a guy comes up to me,and hands me a $10 bill,,and he says,,"I'm sorry, I burnednyour CD from a friend." 
 (Laughter) 
 "But I read your blog,nI know you hate your label.,I just want you to have this money." 
 And this starts happening all the time.,I become the hat after my own gigs,,but I have to physically stand therenand take the help from people,,and unlike the guy in the opening band,,I've actually had a lotnof practice standing there.,Thank you. 
 And this is the moment I decide,I'm just going to give awaynmy music for free,online whenever possible,,so it's like Metallicanover here, Napster, bad;,Amanda Palmer over here,,and I'm going to encouragentorrenting, downloading, sharing,,but I'm going to ask for help,,because I saw it work on the street.,So I fought my way off my label,nand for my next project,with my new band,nthe Grand Theft Orchestra,,I turned to crowdfunding.,And I fell into those thousandsnof connections that I'd made,,and I asked my crowd to catch me.,And the goal was 100,000 dollars.,My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,,which was the biggest musicncrowdfunding project to date. 
 (Applause) 
 And you can see how many people it is.,It's about 25,000 people. 
 And the media asked,,"Amanda, the music business is tankingnand you encourage piracy.,How did you makenall these people pay for music?",And the real answer is,nI didn't make them.,I asked them.,And through the very act of asking people,,I'd connected with them,,and when you connect with them,npeople want to help you.,It's kind of counterintuitivenfor a lot of artists.,They don't want to ask for things.,But it's not easy.,It's not easy to ask.,And a lot of artists havena problem with this.,Asking makes you vulnerable. 
 And I got a lot of criticism online,,after my Kickstarter went big,,for continuing my crazyncrowdsourcing practices,,specifically for asking musicians,who are fans if they wantednto join us on stage,for a few songs in exchangenfor love and tickets and beer,,and this was a doctored imagenthat went up of me on a website.,And this hurt in a really familiar way.,And people saying,,"You're not allowed anymorento ask for that kind of help,",really reminded me of the peoplenin their cars yelling, "Get a job.",Because they weren'tnwith us on the sidewalk,,and they couldn't see the exchange,that was happeningnbetween me and my crowd,,an exchange that was very fairnto us but alien to them. 
 So this is slightly not safe for work.,This is my Kickstarternbacker party in Berlin.,At the end of the night, I strippednand let everyone draw on me.,Now let me tell you,nif you want to experience,the visceral feelingnof trusting strangers -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I recommend this,,especially if those strangersnare drunk German people. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was a ninjanmaster-level fan connection,,because what I was really saying here was,,I trust you this much.,Should I?,Show me. 
 For most of human history,,musicians, artists, they've beennpart of the community.,Connectors and openers,nnot untouchable stars.,Celebrity is about a lot of peoplenloving you from a distance,,but the Internet,and the content that we're freelynable to share on it,are taking us back.,It's about a few peoplenloving you up close,and about those people being enough.,So a lot of peoplenare confused by the idea,of no hard sticker price.,They see it as an unpredictable risk,nbut the things I've done,,the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,,I don't see these things as risk.,I see them as trust.,Now, the online tools,to make the exchange as easynand as instinctive as the street,,they're getting there.,But the perfect toolsnaren't going to help us,if we can't face each other,and give and receive fearlessly,,but, more important --,to ask without shame. 
 My music career has been spent,trying to encounter people on the Internetnthe way I could on the box.,So blogging and tweetingnnot just about my tour dates,and my new videonbut about our work and our art,and our fears and our hangovers,,our mistakes,,and we see each other.,And I think when we really see each other,,we want to help each other. 
 I think people have been obsessednwith the wrong question,,which is, "How do we makenpeople pay for music?",What if we started asking,,"How do we let people pay for music?" 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was 14 years old,,I had low self-esteem.,I felt I was not talented at anything. 
 One day, I bought a yo-yo.,When I tried my first trick,nit looked like this: 
 (Laughter) 
 I couldn't even do the simplest trick,,but it was very natural for me,,because I was not dextrous,nand hated all sports.,But after one week of practicing,,my throws became more like this:,A bit better.,I thought, the yo-yonis something for me to be good at.,For the first time in my life,,I found my passion.,I was spending all my time practicing.,It took me hours and hours a daynto build my skills up to the next level. 
 And then, four years later,nwhen I was 18 years old,,I was standing onstagenat the World YoYo Contest.,And I won.,I was so excited.,"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.,I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,,tons of interviews,nand be on TV!" I thought. 
 (Laughter) 
 But after coming back to Japan,,totally nothing changed in my life. 
 (Laughter) 
 I realized societyndidn't value my passion.,So I went back to my college,and became a typical Japanese workernas a systems engineer.,I felt my passion,nheart and soul, had left my body.,I felt I was not alive anymore. 
 So I started to consider what I should do,,and I thought, I wanted to makenmy performance better,,and to show onstagenhow spectacular the yo-yo could be,to change the public's image of the yo-yo. 
 So I quit my company,and started a careernas a professional performer.,I started to learn classic ballet,njazz dance, acrobatics and other things,to make my performance better. 
 As a result of these efforts,nand the help of many others,,it happened.,I won the World YoYo Contest againnin the artistic performance division.,I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.,Today, I am standing on the TED stage,with the yo-yo in front of you. 
 (Applause) 
 What I learned from the yo-yo is,,if I make enough effort with huge passion,,there is no impossible. 
 Could you let me share my passion with you,through my performance?

 (Music) 
 (Applause)I'd like to talk today,about how we can change our brains,and our society. 
 Meet Joe.,Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.,I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing,at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.,I'd like you to imagine this place.,It looks and feels like it sounds:,Wormwood Scrubs.,Built at the end of the Victorian Era,by the inmates themselves,,it is where England's mostndangerous prisoners are kept.,These individuals have committed acts,of unspeakable evil.,And I was there to study their brains.,I was part of a team of researchers,from University College London,,on a grant from the U.K. department of health.,My task was to study a group of inmates,who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.,That meant they were the most,callous and the most aggressive,of the entire prison population.,What lay at the root of their behavior?,Was there a neurological cause for their condition?,And if there was a neurological cause,,could we find a cure? 
 So I'd like to speak about change, and nespecially about emotional change.,Growing up, I was always intrigued,by how people change.,My mother, a clinical psychotherapist,,would occasionally see patients at home,in the evening.,She would shut the door to the living room,,and I imagined,magical things happened in that room.,At the age of five or six,I would creep up in my pajamas,and sit outside with my ear glued to the door.,On more than one occasion, I fell asleep,and they had to push me out of the way,at the end of the session. 
 And I suppose that's how I found myself,walking into the secure interview room,on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.,Joe sat across a steel table,and greeted me with this blank expression.,The prison warden, looking equally indifferent,,said, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,,and we'll be around as soon as we can.",(Laughter) 
 I sat down.,The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.,I looked up at the red buzzer,far behind Joe on the opposite wall.,(Laughter) 
 I looked at Joe.,Perhaps detecting my concern,,he leaned forward, and said,,as reassuringly as he could,,"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,,it doesn't work anyway.",(Laughter) 
 Over the subsequent months,,we tested Joe and his fellow inmates,,looking specifically at their ability,to categorize different images of emotion.,And we looked at their physical response,to those emotions.,So, for example, when most of us look,at a picture like this of somebody looking sad,,we instantly have a slight,,measurable physical response:,increased heart rate, sweating of the skin.,Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able,to describe the pictures accurately,,they failed to show the emotions required.,They failed to show a physical response.,It was as though they knew the words,but not the music of empathy.,So we wanted to look closer at this,to use MRI to image their brains.,That turned out to be not such an easy task.,Imagine transporting a collection,of clinical psychopaths across central London,in shackles and handcuffs,in rush hour,,and in order to place eachnof them in an MRI scanner,,you have to remove all metal objects,,including shackles and handcuffs,,and, as I learned, all body piercings. 
 After some time, however,nwe had a tentative answer.,These individuals were not just the victims,of a troubled childhood.,There was something else.,People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area,called the amygdala.,The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ,deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.,It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.,Normally, the more empathic a person is,,the larger and more active their amygdala is.,Our population of inmates,had a deficient amygdala,,which likely led to their lack of empathy,and to their immoral behavior. 
 So let's take a step back.,Normally, acquiring moral behavior,is simply part of growing up,,like learning to speak.,At the age of six months, virtually every one of us,is able to differentiate betweennanimate and inanimate objects.,At the age of 12 months,,most children are able to imitate,the purposeful actions of others.,So for example, your mother raises her hands,to stretch, and you imitate her behavior.,At first, this isn't perfect.,I remember my cousin Sasha,,two years old at the time,,looking through a picture book,and licking one finger and flickingnthe page with the other hand,,licking one finger and flickingnthe page with the other hand.,(Laughter),Bit by bit, we build the foundations nof the social brain,so that by the time we're three, four years old,,most children, not all,,have acquired the ability to understand,the intentions of others,,another prerequisite for empathy.,The fact that this developmental progression,is universal,,irrespective of where you live in the world,or which culture you inhabit,,strongly suggests that the foundations,of moral behavior are inborn.,If you doubt this,,try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made,to a four-year-old.,You will find that the mind of a four-year old,is not naïve in the slightest.,It is more akin to a Swiss army knife,with fixed mental modules,finely honed during development,and a sharp sense of fairness.,The early years are crucial.,There seems to be a window of opportunity,,after which mastering moral questions,becomes more difficult,,like adults learning a foreign language.,That's not to say it's impossible.,A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University,showed that people who have played,a virtual reality game in which they took on,the role of a good and helpful superhero,actually became more caring and helpful,towards others afterwards.,Now I'm not suggesting,we endow criminals with superpowers,,but I am suggesting that we need to find ways,to get Joe and people like him,to change their brains and their behavior,,for their benefit,and for the benefit of the rest of us. 
 So can brains change?,For over 100 years,,neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists,held the view that after initialndevelopment in childhood,,no new brain cells could grow,in the adult human brain.,The brain could only change,within certain set limits.,That was the dogma.,But then, in the 1990s,,studies starting showing,,following the lead of ElizabethnGould at Princeton and others,,studies started showing thenevidence of neurogenesis,,the birth of new brain cells,in the adult mammalian brain,,first in the olfactory bulb,,which is responsible for our sense of smell,,then in the hippocampus,involving short-term memory,,and finally in the amygdala itself.,In order to understand,how this process works,,I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford,specializing in learning and development.,Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice,,because the same pattern of brain responses,appears across many differentnspecies of social animals.,So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,,a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,,alone and without much stimulation,,not only does it not thrive,,but it will often develop strange,,repetitive behaviors.,This naturally sociable animal,will lose its ability to bond with other mice,,even becoming aggressive when introduced to them.,However, mice reared in what we called,an enriched environment,,a large habitation with other mice,with wheels and ladders and areas to explore,,demonstrate neurogenesis,,the birth of new brain cells,,and as we showed, they also perform better,on a range of learning and memory tasks.,Now, they don't develop morality to the point of,carrying the shopping bags of little old mice,across the street,,but their improved environment results in healthy,,sociable behavior.,Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,,not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,,have dramatically lower levels of new neurons,in the brain. 
 It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,,including primates like us,,can show neurogenesis.,In some areas of the brain,,more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.,We're just beginning to understand,what exact function these cells have,,but what it implies is that the brain is capable,of extraordinary change way into adulthood.,However, our brains are also,exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.,Stress hormones, glucocorticoids,,released by the brain,,suppress the growth of these new cells.,The more stress, the less brain development,,which in turn causes less adaptability,and causes higher stress levels.,This is the interplay between nature and nurture,in real time in front of our eyes.,When you think about it,,it is ironic that our current solution,for people with stressed amygdalae,is to place them in an environment,that actually inhibits any chance of further growth.,Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part,of the criminal justice system,and of protecting society.,Our research does not suggest,that criminals should submit their MRI scans,as evidence in court,and get off the hook becausenthey've got a faulty amygdala.,The evidence is actually the other way.,Because our brains are capable of change,,we need to take responsibility for our actions,,and they need to take responsibility,for their rehabilitation.,One way such rehabilitation might work,is through restorative justice programs.,Here victims, if they choose to participate,,and perpetrators meet face to face,in safe, structured encounters,,and the perpetrator is encouraged,to take responsibility for their actions,,and the victim plays an active role in the process.,In such a setting, the perpetrator can see,,perhaps for the first time,,the victim as a real person,with thoughts and feelings and a genuine,emotional response.,This stimulates the amygdala,and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice,than simple incarceration.,Such programs won't work for everyone,,but for many, it could be a way,to break the frozen sea within. 
 So what can we do now?,How can we apply this knowledge?,I'd like to leave you with,three lessons that I learned.,The first thing that I learned was that,we need to change our mindset.,Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,,society has advanced in virtually every aspect,,in the way we run our schools, our hospitals.,Yet the moment we speak about prisons,,it's as though we're back in Dickensian times,,if not medieval times.,For too long, I believe,,we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded,of the false notion that human nnature cannot change,,and as a society, it's costing us dearly.,We know that the brain isncapable of extraordinary change,,and the best way to achieve that,,even in adults, is to change and modulate,our environment. 
 The second thing I have learned,is that we need to create an alliance,of people who believe that science is integral,to bringing about social change.,It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place,a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.,Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy,,but ultimately what we want to show,is whether we're able tonreduce the reoffending rates.,In order to answer complex questions like that,,we need people of different backgrounds --,lab-based scientists and clinicians,,social workers and policy makers,,philanthropists and human rights activists —,to work together. 
 Finally, I believe we need,to change our own amygdalae,,because this issue goes to the heart,not just of who Joe is,,but who we are.,We need to change our view of Joe,as someone wholly irredeemable,,because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,,how is he going to see himself as any different?,In another decade, Joe will be released,from Wormwood Scrubs.,Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates,who end up reoffending,and returning to the prison system?,Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,,Joe was able to train his amygdala,,which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells,and connections,,so that he will be able to face the world,once he gets released?,Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)So, this book that I have in my hand,is a directory of everybody who had an email address,in 1982. (Laughter),Actually, it's deceptively large.,There's actually only about 20 people on each page,,because we have the name, address,and telephone number of every single person.,And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,,because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.,Obviously a very small community.,There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.,I knew them both.,We didn't all know each other,,but we all kind of trusted each other,,and that basic feeling of trust,permeated the whole network,,and there was a real sense that,we could depend on each other to do things. 
 So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,,let me tell you what it was like,to register a domain name in the early days.,Now, it just so happened that I got to register,the third domain name on the Internet.,So I could have anything I wanted,other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.,So I picked think.com, but then I thought,,you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.,Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.,And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice." 
 (Laughter) 
 That attitude of only taking what you need,was really what everybody had on the network in those days,,and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,,but it was actually kind of built into the protocols,of the Internet itself.,So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,,and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it,,were fundamentally "from each according to their ability,,to each according to their need.",And so, if you had some extra bandwidth,,you'd deliver a message for someone.,If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.,You'd kind of depend on people to do that,,and that was the building block.,It was actually interesting that such a communist principle,was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War,by the Defense Department,,but it obviously worked really well,,and we all saw what happened with the Internet.,It was incredibly successful. 
 In fact, it was so successful that there's no way,that these days you could make a book like this.,My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.,But, of course, you couldn't do it,,because we don't know the names of all the people,with Internet or email addresses,,and even if we did know their names,,I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,,address and telephone number published to everyone. 
 So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,,and so we dealt with that by making,walled communities,,secure subnetworks, VPNs,,little things that aren't really the Internet,but are made out of the same building blocks,,but we're still basically building it out of those,same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.,And that means that it's vulnerable,to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,,or certain kinds of deliberate attacks,,but even the mistakes can be bad. 
 So, for instance,,in all of Asia recently,,it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while,because Pakistan made some mistakes,in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.,They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did,because of the way that the protocols work.,Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,,you may remember a couple of years ago,,all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded,because a single routing card in Salt Lake City,had a bug in it.,Now, you don't really think,that our airplane system depends on the Internet,,and in some sense it doesn't.,I'll come back to that later.,But the fact is that people couldn't take off,because something was going wrong on the Internet,,and the router card was down. 
 And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.,Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.,All of a sudden,,a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,,including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,,started getting re-routed through China.,So for a few hours, it all passed through China.,Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,,and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,,but certainly somebody could make,a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,,and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.,Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. 
 So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States,or Western civilization these days,,they're not going to do it with tanks.,That will not succeed.,What they'll probably do is something,very much like the attack that happened,on the Iranian nuclear facility.,Nobody has claimed credit for that.,There was basically a factory of industrial machines.,It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.,It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,,but it was possible for somebody to smuggle,a USB drive in there, or something like that,,and software got in there that causes the centrifuges,,in that case, to actually destroy themselves.,Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery,or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.,And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,,about worries about cyberattacks,and defenses against those. 
 But the fact is, people are mostly focused on,defending the computers on the Internet,,and there's been surprisingly little attention,to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.,And I think we probably do need to pay,some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.,So actually, in the early days,,back when it was the ARPANET,,there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely,because one single message processor,actually got a bug in it.,And the way the Internet works is,the routers are basically exchanging information,about how they can get messages to places,,and this one processor, because of a broken card,,decided it could actually get a message,to some place in negative time.,So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.,So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere,was to send it to this guy,,who would send it back in time and get it there super early,,so every message in the Internet,started getting switched through this one node,,and of course that clogged everything up.,Everything started breaking.,The interesting thing was, though,,that the sysadmins were able to fix it,,but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.,Now, of course you couldn't do that today.,I mean, everything off, it's like,the service call you get from the cable company,,except for the whole world. 
 Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.,One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones,use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on,that go through the Internet right now,,and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it,for more and more different things,,like when you take off from LAX,,you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.,When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.,What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems,are beginning to use the Internet.,Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet,,but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,,for administrative functions,,and so if you take something like the cell phone system,,which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,,Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it,in terms of some of the control and administrative functions,,and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks,because they work so well, they're cheap,,they're repeated, and so on.,So all of our systems, more and more,,are starting to use the same technology,and starting to depend on this technology.,And so even a modern rocket ship these days,actually uses Internet protocol to talk,from one end of the rocket ship to the other.,That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that. 
 So we've built this system,where we understand all the parts of it,,but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,,and it's gotten a very, very different scale,than it was designed for.,And in fact, nobody really exactly understands,all the things it's being used for right now.,It's turning into one of these big emergent systems,like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts,but nobody really exactly understands,how it operates and all the little details of it,and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.,And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet,and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,,you should treat it with the same skepticism,that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy,or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.,They have an informed opinion,,but it's changing so quickly that even the experts,don't know exactly what's going on.,So if you see one of these maps of the Internet,,it's just somebody's guess.,Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now,because it's different than it was an hour ago.,It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring. 
 And the problem with it is,,I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster,like the disaster we had in the financial system,,where we take a system that's basically built on trust,,was basically built for a smaller-scale system,,and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits,of how it was meant to operate.,And so right now, I think it's literally true,that we don't know what the consequences,of an effective denial-of-service attack,on the Internet would be,,and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,,and worse next year, and so on. 
 But so what we need is a plan B.,There is no plan B right now.,There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept,to be independent of the Internet,,made out of completely different sets of building blocks.,So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily,have to have the performance of the Internet,,but the police department has to be able,to call up the fire department even without the Internet,,or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.,This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.,It's actually relatively simple to do, technically,,because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,,existing wireless infrastructure.,It's basically a matter of deciding to do it. 
 But people won't decide to do it,until they recognize the need for it,,and that's the problem that we have right now.,So there's been plenty of people,,plenty of us have been quietly arguing,that we should have this independent system for years,,but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B,when plan A seems to be working so well. 
 So I think that, if people understand,how much we're starting to depend on the Internet,,and how vulnerable it is,,we could get focused on,just wanting this other system to exist,,and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,,I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.,It's not that hard a problem.,It could definitely be done by people in this room. 
 And so I think that this is actually,,of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,,this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.,So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet,a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with,in the wild for the last 28 years. 
 Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains,and what they might be doing with all that brainpower,in the wild.,And we know they use some of that brainpower,for just living complicated lives,,but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence? 
 Well, we know a few things.,We know that their brain-to-body ratio,,which is a physical measure of intelligence,,is second only to humans.,Cognitively, they can understand,artificially-created languages.,And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.,And in some parts of the world, they use tools,,like sponges to hunt fish.,But there's one big question left:,do they have a language, and if so,,what are they talking about? 
 So decades ago, not years ago,,I set out to find a place in the world,where I could observe dolphins underwater,to try to crack the code of their communication system.,Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,,so it's very hard to observe animals underwater,,but I found a community of dolphins that live,in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas,which are just east of Florida.,And they spend their daytime resting and socializing,in the safety of the shallows, but at night,,they go off the edge and hunt in deep water. 
 Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.,So we go out for about five months every summer,in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work,at sea for weeks at a time.,My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,,which is an underwater microphone, and this is so,I can correlate sound and behavior.,And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.,We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,,since we're actually observing them physically in the water.,Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species,to work with for a couple of reasons.,They're born without spots, and they get spots with age,,and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,,so that's fun to track their behavior.,And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white. 
 Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.,She's 35 years old in this shot,,but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.,And like all the dolphins in our community,,we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots,and nicks in her dorsal fin,,and also the unique spot patterns,as she matured over time. 
 Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,,and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,,and at about the age of nine, the females,become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,,and the males mature quite a bit later,,at around 15 years of age.,And dolphins are very promiscuous,,and so we have to determine who the fathers are,,so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material,out of the water and extracting DNA.,So what that means is, after 28 years,,we are tracking three generations,,including grandmothers and grandfathers.,Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.,They make sounds 10 times as high,and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.,But they have other communication signals they use.,They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.,They have taste, not smell.,And they have touch.,And sound can actually be felt in the water,,because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.,So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance. 
 Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used,with certain behaviors.,Now, the signature whistle is a whistle,that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises),And this is the best-studied sound,,because it's easy to measure, really,,and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves,are reuniting, for example. 
 Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.,This is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises),And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.,But they can also tightly pack these clicks together,into buzzes and use them socially.,For example, males will stimulate a female,during a courtship chase.,You know, I've been buzzed in the water.,(Laughter),Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.,And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.,(Laughter) 
 So dolphins are also political animals,,so they have to resolve conflicts.,(Dolphin noises),And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as,their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.,And these are very unstudied sounds,because they're hard to measure. 
 Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.,(Dolphin noises),So you're going to see two groups,,and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,,some open mouths,,lots of squawking.,There's a bubble.,And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off,and everything will resolve fine,,and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much. 
 Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose,that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.,For example, they babysit each other's calves.,The males have dominance displays that they use,when they're chasing each other's females.,And the two species actually form temporary alliances,when they're chasing sharks away.,And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate,their coordination is synchrony.,They synchronize their sounds and their body postures,to look bigger and sound stronger.,(Dolphins noises),Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,,and you'll see them starting to synchronize,their behavior and their sounds.,(Dolphin noises),You see, they're synchronizing with their partner,as well as the other dyad.,I wish I was that coordinated. 
 Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing,the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,,and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,,and we use special equipment in the water,to collect these sounds.,Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity,using information theory,,and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.,But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery. 
 Now, these are three spectragrams.,Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.,So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.,Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look,a bit like human phonemes. 
 Now, one way to crack the code,is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,,but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.,But a second way to crack the code,is to develop some technology,,an interface to do two-way communication,,and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas,and in real time.,Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces,to try to bridge the gap with species,including chimpanzees and dolphins.,This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,,at the Epcot Center, was actually,the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed,for humans and dolphins to work together under the water,and exchange information.,So we wanted to develop an interface like this,in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.,And one of the reasons we thought we could do this,is because the dolphins were starting to show us,a lot of mutual curiosity.,They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations,and our postures, and they were also inviting us,into dolphin games.,Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,,and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,,or sargassum in this case, around.,And they're very adept. They like to drag it,and drop it from appendage to appendage.,Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.,She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,,and he's just learning how to play this game.,(Dolphin noises),She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.,He really wants that sargassum.,Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,,they'll often sink vertically in the water,,and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,,and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes,on the bottom and let us go get it,,and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.,But when we don't dive down and get it,,they'll bring it to the surface,and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail,and drop it for us like they do their calves,,and then we'll pick it up and have a game. 
 And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat,to build some technology that would allow the dolphins,to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?,So the original vision was to have a keyboard,hanging from the boat attached to a computer,,and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys,on the keypad and happily exchange information,and request toys from each other.,But we quickly found out that dolphins simply,were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.,They've got better things to do in the wild.,They might do it in captivity, but in the wild -- 
 So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,,and we labeled four objects they like to play with,,the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,,which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle),And that's the scarf whistle,,which is also associated with a visual symbol.,And these are artificially created whistles.,They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,,but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.,And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,,working out in the field with this keyboard,using it with each other to do requests for toys,while the dolphins were watching.,And the dolphins could get in on the game.,They could point at the visual object,,or they could mimic the whistle. 
 Now this is video of a session.,The diver here has a rope toy,,and I'm on the keyboard on the left,,and I've just played the rope key,,and that's the request for the toy from the human.,So I've got the rope, I'm diving down,,and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,,because they're kind of like little kids.,You have to keep their attention.,I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.,Here they come,,and then they're going to pick up the rope,and drag it around as a toy.,Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left,,and this is actually the first time that we tried this.,I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,,from the dolphins using the rope sound.,Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.,(Whistle),That's the rope whistle.,Up come the dolphins,,and drop off the rope, yay. Wow. 
 (Applause) 
 So this is only once.,We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.,Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.,This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin,over to the keyboard to show her,the visual and the acoustic signal.,Now this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,",because over the years she's absconded,with about 12 scarves.,In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.,So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.,And we try to not touch the animals too much,,we really don't want to over-habituate them.,And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.,And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound,to request the scarf.,So I try to give her the scarf.,Whoop. Almost lost it.,But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.,The dolphin's at the keyboard.,You've got full attention.,And this sometimes went on for hours.,And I wanted to share this video with you,not to show you any big breakthroughs,,because they haven't happened yet,,but to show you the level of intention and focus,that these dolphins have, and interest in the system. 
 And because of this, we really decided we needed,some more sophisticated technology.,So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,,with Thad Starner's wearable computing group,,to build us an underwater wearable computer,that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry],Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,,the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,,so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad,on the forearm,,the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,,if a dolphin mimics the whistle,or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in,and are localized by two hydrophones.,The computer can localize who requested the toy,if there's a word match.,And the real power of the system is in the real-time,sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins,quickly and accurately. 
 And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.,So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer,and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,,the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,,but also as a word through bone conduction.,So Diver A plays the scarf whistle,or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle,to request a toy from whoever has it.,What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,,and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound,that was played and requested,,then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin,and they'll swim away happily into the sunset,playing sargassum for forever. 
 Now, how far can this kind of communication go?,Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins,to request things from us.,It's designed to really be two-way.,Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?,We hope so and we think so.,But as we decode their natural sounds,,we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.,For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles,in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.,Likewise, we can create our own whistles,,our own whistle names, and let the dolphins,request specific divers to interact with. 
 Now it may be that all our mobile technology,will actually be the same technology that helps us,communicate with another species down the road.,In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,,well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways,and we might not be able to admit that right now,,but they live in quite a different environment,,and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems. 
 I mean, imagine what it would be like,to really understand the mind,of another intelligent species on the planet. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Have you ever experiencedna moment in your life,that was so painful and confusing,,that all you wanted to do,was learn as much as you couldnto make sense of it all?,When I was 13, a close family friendnwho was like an uncle to me,passed away from pancreatic cancer.,When the disease hit so close to home,,I knew I needed to learn more.,So I went online to find answers.,Using the Internet, I found a varietynof statistics on pancreatic cancer,,and what I had found shocked me.,Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancersnare diagnosed late,,when someone has lessnthan a two percent chance of survival.,Why are we so bad at detectingnpancreatic cancer?,The reason?,Today's current "modern" medicinenis a 60-year-old technique.,That's older than my dad.,(Laughter),But also, it's extremely expensive,ncosting 800 dollars per test,,and it's grossly inaccurate, missingn30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.,Your doctor would have to be ridiculouslynsuspicious that you have the cancer,in order to give you this test.,Learning this, I knew therenhad to be a better way.,So, I set up scientific criteria,as to what a sensornwould have to look like,in order to effectivelyndiagnose pancreatic cancer.,The sensor would have to be:,inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,,selective, and minimally invasive.,Now, there's a reason why this testnhasn't been updated in over six decades.,And that's because whennwe're looking for pancreatic cancer,,we're looking at your bloodstream,,which is already abundant in all thesentons and tons of protein,,and you're looking for this minisculendifference in this tiny amount of protein.,Just this one protein.,That's next to impossible.,However, undeterredndue to my teenage optimism --,(Laughter),(Applause),I went online to a teenager'sntwo best friends, Google and Wikipedia.,I got everything for my homeworknfrom those two sources.,(Laughter),And what I had found was an article,that listed a databasenof over 8,000 different proteins,that are found when you havenpancreatic cancer.,So, I decided to gonand make it my new mission,to go through all these proteins,,and see which ones could servenas a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.,And to make it a bit simpler for myself,,I decided to map outnscientific criteria, and here it is.,Essentially, first, the protein would havento be found in all pancreatic cancers,,at high levels in the bloodstream,,in the earliest stages,nbut also only in cancer.,And so I'm just plugging and chuggingnthrough this gargantuan task,,and finally, on the 4,000th try,,when I'm close to losing my sanity,,I find the protein.,And the name of the proteinnI'd located was called mesothelin,,and it's just your ordinary,nrun-of-the-mill type protein,,unless, of course, you havenpancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,,in which case it's found at thesenvery high levels in your bloodstream.,But also, the key is that it's foundnin the earliest stages of the disease,,when someone has closento 100 percent chance of survival.,So now that I'd foundna reliable protein I could detect,,I then shifted my focusnto actually detecting that protein,,and thus, pancreatic cancer.,Now, my breakthroughncame in a very unlikely place,,possibly the most unlikelynplace for innovation --,my high school biology class,nthe absolute stifler of innovation.,(Laughter),(Applause),And I had snuck in this articlenon these things called carbon nanotubes,,and that's just a long,nthin pipe of carbon,that's an atom thick, and onen50,000th the diameter of your hair.,And despite their extremely small sizes,,they have these incredible properties.,They're kind of like the superheroesnof material science.,And while I was sneakily reading thisnarticle under my desk in my biology class,,we were supposed to be paying attentionnto these other kind of cool molecules,,called antibodies.,And these are pretty coolnbecause they only react,with one specific protein,,but they're not nearlynas interesting as carbon nanotubes.,And so then, I was sitting in class,nand suddenly it hit me:,I could combine what I wasnreading about, carbon nanotubes,,with what I was supposed to benthinking about, antibodies.,Essentially, I could weavena bunch of these antibodies,into a network of carbon nanotubes,,such that you have a networknthat only reacts with one protein,,but also, due to the propertiesnof these nanotubes,,it will change its electrical properties,,based on the amount of protein present.,However, there's a catch.,These networks of carbonnnanotubes are extremely flimsy.,And since they're so delicate,nthey need to be supported.,So that's why I chose to use paper.,Making a cancer sensornout of paper is about as simple,as making chocolate chipncookies, which I love.,(Laughs),You start with some water,npour in some nanotubes,,add antibodies, mix it up,ntake some paper, dip it, dry it,,and you can detect cancer.,(Applause),Then, suddenly, a thought occurred,that kind of put a blemishnon my amazing plan here.,I can't really do cancer researchnon my kitchen countertop.,My mom wouldn't really like that.,So instead, I decided to go for a lab.,So I typed up a budget, a materials list,na timeline, and a procedure,,and I emailed itnto 200 different professors,at Johns Hopkins Universitynand the National Institutes of Health --,essentially, anyone that had anythingnto do with pancreatic cancer.,I sat back waiting for thesenpositive emails to be pouring in,,saying, "You're a genius!nYou're going to save us all!",And --,(Laughter),Then reality took hold,nand over the course of a month,,I got 199 rejectionsnout of those 200 emails.,One professor even wentnthrough my entire procedure,,painstakingly -- I'm not reallynsure where he got all this time --,and he went through and saidnwhy each and every step,was like the worst mistakenI could ever make.,Clearly, the professors did not havenas high of an opinion of my work as I did.,However, there is a silver lining.,One professor said, "Maybe I mightnbe able to help you, kid.",So, I went in that direction.,(Laughter),As you can never say no to a kid.,And so then, three months later,,I finally nailed downna harsh deadline with this guy,,and I get into his lab, I getnall excited, and then I sit down,,I start opening my mouth and talking,,and five seconds later,nhe calls in another Ph.D.,Ph.D.s just flock into this little room,,and they're just firingnthese questions at me,,and by the end, I kind of feltnlike I was in a clown car.,There were 20 Ph.D.s,nplus me and the professor,crammed into this tiny office space,,with them firing thesenrapid-fire questions at me,,trying to sink my procedure.,How unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.,(Laughter),However, subjecting myselfnto that interrogation --,I answered all their questions,nand I guessed on quite a few,but I got them right --,and I finally landednthe lab space I needed.,But it was shortly afterwards thatnI discovered my once brilliant procedure,had something like a million holes in it,,and over the course of seven months,,I painstakingly filledneach and every one of those holes.,The result?,One small paper sensor that costsnthree cents and takes five minutes to run.,This makes it 168 times faster,,over 26,000 times less expensive,,and over 400 times more sensitiventhan our current standard,for pancreatic cancer detection.,(Applause),One of the best partsnof the sensor, though,,is that it has closento 100 percent accuracy,,and can detect the cancernin the earliest stages,,when someone has closento 100 percent chance of survival.,And so in the next two to five years,,this sensor could potentially liftnthe pancreatic cancer survival rates,from a dismal 5.5 percentnto close to 100 percent,,and it would do similarnfor ovarian and lung cancer.,But it wouldn't stop there.,By switching out that antibody,,you can look at a different protein,nthus, a different disease --,potentially any diseasenin the entire world.,So that ranges from heart disease,nto malaria, HIV, AIDS,,as well as other formsnof cancer -- anything.,And so, hopefully one day,,we can all have that one extra uncle,,that one mother, that one brother, sister,,we can have that one morenfamily member to love.,And that our hearts will be ridnof that one disease burden,that comes from pancreatic,novarian and lung cancer,,and potentially any disease.,But through the Internet,nanything is possible.,Theories can be shared,,and you don't have to bena professor with multiple degrees,to have your ideas valued.,It's a neutral space, wherenwhat you look like, age or gender --,it doesn't matter.,It's just your ideas that count.,For me, it's all about lookingnat the Internet in an entirely new way,,to realize that there's so much more to it,than just posting duck-facenpictures of yourself online.,(Laughter),You could be changing the world.,So if a 15 year-old who didn't even knownwhat a pancreas was,could find a new waynto detect pancreatic cancer --,just imagine what you could do.,Thank you.,(Applause)(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Hi, everybody. 
 Ban-gap-seum-ni-da. 
 I'd like to share with you a little bit of me,playing my life. 
 I might look successful and happy,being in front of you today,,but I once suffered from severe depression,and was in total despair.,The violin, which meant everything to me,,became a grave burden on me.,Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,,their words sounded like meaningless noise.,When I was just about to give everything up,after years of suffering,,I started to rediscover the true power of music. 
 (Music) 
 In the midst of hardship,,it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.,The comfort the music gave me,was just indescribable,,and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,,and it totally changed my perspective on life,and set me free from the pressure,of becoming a successful violinist. 
 Do you feel like you are all alone?,I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,,as it did for me. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts,and have found there are no boundaries.,My audience is anyone who is here to listen,,even those who are not familiar with classical music.,I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls,like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,,but also hospitals, churches, prisons,,and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,,just to mention a few. 
 Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you,that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,,and that it can rock you.,Let me introduce you to my brand new project,,"Baroque in Rock,",which became a golden disc most recently.,It's such an honor for me. 
 I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,,I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.,But it's now your turn.,Changing your perspectives,will not only transform you but also the whole world.,Just play your life with all you have,,and share it with the world.,I really look forward to witnessing,a transforming world by you, TEDsters.,Play your life, and stay tuned. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)Throughout the history of computers,we've been strivingnto shorten the gap between us,and digital information,,the gap between our physical world,and the world in the screen,where our imagination can go wild.,And this gap has become shorter,,shorter, and even shorter,,and now this gap is shortened down,to less than a millimeter,,the thickness of a touch-screen glass,,and the power of computing,has become accessible to everyone.,But I wondered, what if therencould be no boundary at all?,I started to imaginenwhat this would look like.,First, I created this tool,which penetrates into the digital space,,so when you press it hard on the screen,,it transfers its physicalnbody into pixels.,Designers can materialize their ideas,directly in 3D,,and surgeons can practicenon virtual organs,underneath the screen.,So with this tool, thisnboundary has been broken.,But our two hands stillnremain outside the screen.,How can you reach inside and interact,with the digital information,using the full dexterity of our hands?,At Microsoft Applied Sciences,,along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,,I redesigned the computer,and turned a little spacenabove the keyboard,into a digital workspace.,By combining a transparentndisplay and depth cameras,for sensing your fingers and face,,now you can lift up your handsnfrom the keyboard,and reach inside this 3D space,and grab pixels with your bare hands.,(Applause),Because windows and files havena position in the real space,,selecting them is as easynas grabbing a book off your shelf.,Then you can flip through this book,while highlighting the lines, words,on the virtual touch padnbelow each floating window.,Architects can stretchnor rotate the models,with their two hands directly.,So in these examples,,we are reaching into the digital world.,But how about reversing its role,and having the digitalninformation reach us instead?,I'm sure many of usnhave had the experience,of buying and returning items online.,But now you don't have to worry about it.,What I got here is an onlinenaugmented fitting room.,This is a view that you get from,head-mounted or see-through display,when the system understandsnthe geometry of your body.,Taking this idea further,nI started to think,,instead of just seeingnthese pixels in our space,,how can we make it physical,so that we can touch and feel it?,What would such a future look like?,At MIT Media Lab,nalong with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii,and my collaborator Rehmi Post,,we created this one physical pixel.,Well, in this case, this spherical magnet,acts like a 3D pixel in our space,,which means that both computers and people,can move this object to anywhere,within this little 3D space.,What we did was essentiallyncanceling gravity,and controlling the movement by combining,magnetic levitationnand mechanical actuation,and sensing technologies.,And by digitally programming the object,,we are liberatingnthe object from constraints,of time and space, which means that now,,human motions can benrecorded and played back,and left permanentlynin the physical world.,So choreography can be taughtnphysically over distance,and Michael Jordan's famousnshooting can be replicated,over and over as a physical reality.,Students can use this as a tool,to learn about the complex concepts,such as planetary motion, physics,,and unlike computer screens or textbooks,,this is a real, tangible experience,that you can touch and feel,nand it's very powerful.,And what's more exciting,than just turning what's currentlynin the computer physical,is to start imaginingnhow programming the world,will alter even our dailynphysical activities.,(Laughter),As you can see, the digital information,will not just show us something,but it will start directly acting upon us,as a part of our physical surroundings,without disconnectingnourselves from our world.,Today, we started by talkingnabout the boundary,,but if we remove this boundary,,the only boundary left is our imagination.,Thank you.,(Applause)In an age of global strifenand climate change,,I'm here to answernthe all important question:,Why is sex so damn good?,If you're laughing, you know what I mean. 
 Now, before we get to that answer,,let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.,Chris is a great friend of minenfrom my university days,,but secretly, I hate him. 
 Here's why. Back in university,nwe had a quick project,to design some solar-powered clocks.,Here's my clock.,It uses something callednthe dwarf sunflower,,which grows to about 12 inches in height.,Now, as you know, sunflowers,track the sunnduring the course of the day.,So in the morning, you seenwhich direction the sunflower is facing,,and you mark it on the blanknarea in the base.,At noon, you mark the changednposition of the sunflower,,and in the evening again,nand that's your clock.,Now, I know my clock doesn'tntell you the exact time,,but it does give you a generalnidea using a flower.,So, in my completely unbiased,nsubjective opinion,,it's brilliant. 
 However, here's Chris's clock.,It's five magnifying glassesnwith a shot glass under each one.,In each shot glassnis a different scented oil.,In the morning, the sunlightnwill shine down,on the first magnifying glass,,focusing a beam of lightnon the shot glass underneath.,This will warm up the scented oil inside,,and a particular smell will be emitted.,A couple of hours later,nthe sun will shine,on the next magnifying glass,nand a different smell will be emitted.,So during the course of the day,nfive different smells,are dispersed throughout that environment.,Anyone living in that housencan tell the time,just by the smell.,You can see why I hate Chris.,I thought my idea was pretty good,,but his idea is genius,,and at the time, I knewnhis idea was better than mine,,but I just couldn't explain why. 
 One thing you have to knownabout me is I hate to lose.,This problem's been bugging menfor well over a decade.,All right, let's get backnto the question of why sex is so good.,Many years after the solarnpowered clocks project,,a young lady I knew suggestednmaybe sex is so good,because of the five senses. 
 And when she said this, I had an epiphany.,So I decided to evaluate differentnexperiences I had in my life,from the point of view of the five senses.,To do this, I devised somethingncalled the five senses graph.,Along the y-axis, you havena scale from zero to 10,,and along the x-axis, you have,nof course, the five senses.,Anytime I had a memorablenexperience in my life,,I would record it on this graphnlike a five senses diary.,Here's a quick videonto show you how it works. 
 (Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,,and today, I'm going to shownyou what riding motorbikes,is like from the point of viewnof the five senses. Hey! 
 Bike designer: This is [unclear],ncustom bike designer. 
 (Motorcyle revving) 
 [Sound] 
 [Touch] 
 [Sight] 
 [Smell] 
 [Taste] 
 JL: And that's how the five sensesngraph works. 
 Now, for a period of three years,nI gathered data,,not just me but also some of my friends,,and I used to teachnin university, so I forced my --,I mean, I asked my studentsnto do this as well.,So here are some other results.,The first is for instant noodles.,Now obviously, tastenand smell are quite high,,but notice sound is at three.,Many people told me a big part,of the noodle-eating experiencenis the slurping noise.,You know. (Slurps),Needless to say, I no longerndine with these people. 
 OK, next, clubbing.,OK, here what I found interesting was,that taste is at four,nand many respondents told me,it's because of the taste of drinks,,but also, in some cases, kissing is a bignpart of the clubbing experience.,These people I still do hang out with. 
 All right, and smoking.,Here I found touch is at [six],nand one of the reasons,is that smokers told me the sensationnof holding a cigarette,and bringing it up to your lips is a bignpart of the smoking experience,,which shows, it's kind of scary to think,how well cigarettes are designednby the manufacturers. 
 OK. Now, what would the perfectnexperience,look like on the five senses graph?,It would, of course, bena horizontal line along the top.,Now you can see, notneven as intense an experience,as riding a motorbike comes close. 
 In fact, in the yearsnthat I gathered data,,only one experience came closento being the perfect one.,That is, of course, sex. Great sex.,Respondents said that great sex,hits all of the five sensesnat an extreme level. 
 Here I'll quotenone of my students who said,,"Sex is so good, it's goodneven when it's bad." 
 So the five sensesntheory does help explain,why sex is so good.,Now in the middle of all thisnfive senses work,,I suddenly rememberednthe solar-powered clocks project,from my youth.,And I realized this theorynalso explains why Chris's clock,is so much better than mine.,You see, my clock only focuses on sight,,and a little bit of touch.,Here's Chris's clock.,It's the first clock evernthat uses smell to tell the time.,In fact, in terms of the five senses,,Chris's clock is a revolution. 
 And that's what this theoryntaught me about my field.,You see, up till now, us designers,,we've mainly focused on makingnthings look very pretty,,and a little bit of touch,,which means we've ignorednthe other three senses.,Chris's clock shows usnthat even raising just one,of those other senses cannmake for a brilliant product.,So what if we started usingnthe five senses theory,in all of our designs? 
 Here's three quick ideas I came up with.,This is an iron, younknow, for your clothes,,to which I added a spraying mechanism,,so you fill up the vialnwith your favorite scent,,and your clothes will smell nicer,,but hopefully it should also make,the ironing experience more enjoyable.,We could call this "the perfumator." 
 All right, next.,So I brush my teeth twice a day,,and what if we had a toothbrush,that tastes like candy,,and when the taste of candy ran out,,you'd know it's timento change your toothbrush? 
 Finally, I have a thing for the keysnon a flute or a clarinet.,It's not just the way they look,nbut I love the way they feel,when you press down on them.,Now, I don't play the flutenor the clarinet,,so I decided to combine these keysnwith an instrument I do play:,the television remote control. 
 Now, when we look at thesenthree ideas together,,you'll notice that the five senses theory,doesn't only change the waynwe use these products,but also the way they look.,So in conclusion, I've foundnthe five senses theory,to be a very useful tool in evaluating,different experiences in my life,,and then taking those best experiences,and hopefully incorporatingnthem into my designs. 
 Now, I realize the five sensesnisn't the only thing,that makes life interesting.,There's also the six emotions,and that elusive x-factor.,Maybe that could benthe topic of my next talk. 
 Until then, please have fun,using the five senses in your own lives,and your own designs. 
 Oh, one last thing before I leave.,Here's the experience younall had while listening,to the TED Talks.,However, it would be betternif we could boost up,a couple of the other sensesnlike smell and taste.,And the best way to do that is with,free candy.,You guys ready?,All right. 
 (Applause)What would be a good end of life?,And I'm talking about the very end.,I'm talking about dying. 
 We all think a lot about how to live well.,I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.,I'm not a geriatrician.,I design reading programs for preschoolers.,What I know about this topic,comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.,In the last few years, I helped two friends,have the end of life they wanted.,Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage,living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch,in the mountains of Sonoma County.,They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet,so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge,for the bears and lions and so many other things,that lived there.,This was their dream. 
 I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.,They were both only children who chose not to have kids.,As we became friends, I became their trustee,and their medical advocate,,but more importantly, I became,the person who managed their end-of-life experiences.,And we learned a few things about how to have a good end. 
 In their final years, Jim and Shirley,faced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.,It's true.,At the end, our bodily functions,and independence are declining to zero.,What we found is that, with a plan and the right people,,quality of life can remain high.,The beginning of the end is triggered,by a mortality awareness event, and during this time,,Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves,to take their ranch over when they were gone.,This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.,It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.,But one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me.",Jim and Shirley spent this time,letting friends know that their end was near,and that they were okay with that. 
 Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness,are different.,In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.,Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end,,but on his last day he couldn't talk.,Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,,"It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley,right here at the ranch,,and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever." 
 From this experience I'm going to share five practices.,I've put worksheets online,,so if you'd like, you can plan your own end. 
 It starts with a plan.,Most people say, "I'd like to die at home.",Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital,or a nursing home.,Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.,A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me.",This is not a plan either; this is illegal.,(Laughter),A plan involves answering,straightforward questions about the end you want.,Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?,What do you want in terms of medical intervention?,And who's going to make sure your plan is followed? 
 You will need advocates.,Having more than one increases your chance,of getting the end you want.,Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.,You want someone who has the time and proximity,to do this job well, and you want someone,who can work with people under the pressure,of an ever-changing situation. 
 Hospital readiness is critical.,You are likely to be headed to the emergency room,,and you want to get this right.,Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history,,medications and physician information.,Put this in a really bright envelope,with copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,,and your do-not-resuscitate order.,Have advocates keep a set in their car.,Tape a set to your refrigerator.,When you show up in the E.R. with this packet,,your admission is streamlined in a material way. 
 You're going to need caregivers.,You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation,to determine whether an elder care community,or staying at home is your best choice.,In either case, do not settle.,We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers,before we found the perfect team,led by Marsha,,who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying,but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you,when you can't get out there,,and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises,but knows when you need to hear,that your wife is in good hands. 
 Finally, last words.,What do you want to hear at the very end,,and from whom would you like to hear it?,In my experience, you'll want to hear,that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.,When you believe it's okay to let go, you will. 
 So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.,What I've learned,is if we put some time into planning our end of life,,we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.,Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding,who would take care of their ranch.,Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died,,celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.,And here's Shirley just a few days before she died,being read an article in that day's paper,about the significance of the wildlife refuge,at the Modini ranch. 
 Jim and Shirley had a good end of life,,and by sharing their story with you,,I hope to increase our chances of doing the same. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I love paper, and I love technology,,and what I do is I make paper interactive.,And that's what I say whennpeople ask me what I do,,but it really confuses most people,,so really, the best waynfor me to convey it,is to take the technology and be creative,and create experiences.,So I tried to thinknwhat I could use for here,,and a couple of weeksnago I had a crazy idea,that I wanted to print two DJ decks,and to try and mix some music.,And I'm going to trynand show that at the end,,and the suspense will benas much mine if it works.,And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,,so I'm a little bit scared of that.,So I think, I found the bestnway to describe my journey,is just to mention a few little things,that have happened to menthroughout my life.,There's three particularnthings that I've done,,and I'll just describe those first,,and then talk about some of my work.,So when I was a kid,nI was obsessed with wires,,and I used to thread them under my carpet,and thread them behind the walls,and have little switchesnand little speakers,,and I wanted to makenmy bedroom be interactive,but kind of all hidden away.,And I was also reallyninterested in wireless as well.,So I bought one of thosenlittle kits that you could get,to make a radio transmitter,,and I got an old booknand I carved out the inside,and I hid it inside there,,and then I placed it next to my dad,and snuck back to my bedroomnand tuned in on the radio,so I could eavesdrop.,I was not at all interestednin what he was saying.,It's more that I just liked the idea,of an everyday object,having something inside,and doing something different.,Several year later,,I managed to successfullynfail all of my exams,and didn't really leave schoolnwith much to show for at all,,and my parents, maybe as a reward,,bought me what turned out to be,a one-way ticket to Australia,,and I came back homenabout four years later.,I ended up on a farmnin the middle of nowhere.,It was in far western New South Wales.,And this farm was 120,000 acres.,There were 22,000 sheep,,and it was about 40 degrees,,or 100 or so Fahrenheit.,And on this farm therenwas the farmer, his wife,,and there was the four-year-old daughter.,And they kind of took me into the farm,and showed me what itnwas like to live and work.,Obviously, one of the most importantnthings was the sheep,,and so my job was, well,npretty much to do everything,,but it was about bringingnthe sheep back to the homestead.,And we'd do that by building fences,,using motorbikes and horses,,and the sheep would makentheir way all the way back,to the shearing shednfor the different seasons.,And what I learned was,,although at the time, like everyone else,,I thought sheep were pretty stupid,because they didn't donwhat we wanted them to do,,what I realize now, probablynonly just in the last few weeks,looking back, is the sheepnweren't stupid at all.,We'd put them in an environmentnwhere they didn't want to be,,and they didn't want to donwhat we wanted them to do.,So the challenge was to try and get them,to do what we wanted them to do,by listening to the weather,nthe lay of the land,,and creating thingsnthat would let the sheep flow,and go where we wanted them to go.,Another bunch of years later,,I ended up at Cambridge University,at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.,doing a Ph.D. in physics.,My Ph.D. was to move electronsnaround, one at a time.,And I realize — again, it's kindnof these realizations,looking back as to what I did —,I realize now that itnwas pretty much the same,as moving sheep around.,It really is.,It's just you do itnby changing an environment.,And that's kindnof been a big lesson to me,,that you can't act on any object.,You change its environment,nand the object will flow.,So we made it very small,,so things were about 30nnanometers in size;,making it very cold, sonat liquid helium temperatures;,and changing environmentnby changing the voltage,,and the electrons couldnmake flow around a loop,one at a time, on and off,na little memory node.,And I wanted to go one step further,,and I wanted to move one electron on,and one electron off.,And I was told that I wouldn'tnbe able to do this,,which, you know, as we've heardnfrom other people,,that's the thing that makes you do it.,And I was determined, and I managednto show that I could do that.,And a lot of that learning, I think,,came from being on that farm,,because when I was working on the farm,,we'd have to use what was around us,,we'd have to use the environment,,and there was no such thing,as something can't be done,,because you're in an environment where,,if you can't do what you need to do,,you can die, and, you know,,I had seen that sort of thing happen.,So now my obsession is printing,,and I'm really fascinated by the idea,of using conventional printing processes,,so the types of printnthat are used to create,many of the things around us,to make paper and card interactive.,When I spoke to some printersnwhen I started doing this,and told them what I wanted to do,,which was to printnconductive inks onto paper,,they told me it couldn't be done,,again, that kind of favorite thing.,So I got about 10 credit cards and loans,and got myself very closento bankruptcy, really,,and bought myself thisnhuge printing press,,which I had no idea how to use at all.,It was about five meters long,,and I covered myselfnand the floor with ink,and made a massive mess,nbut I learned to print.,And then I took it back to the printersnand showed them what I've done,,and they were like, "Ofncourse you can do that.,Why didn't you come herenin the first place?",That's always the case.,So what we do is we takenconventional printing presses,,we make conductive inks,,and run those through a press,nand basically,just letting hundredsnof thousands of electrons flow,through pieces of paper,so we can make that paper interactive.,And it's pretty simple, really.,It's just a collection of thingsnthat have been done before,,but bringing them togethernin a different way.,So we have a piece of papernwith conductive ink on,,and then add onto that a small circuitnboard with a couple of chips,,one to run some capacitive touch software,,so we know where we've touched it,,and the other to run, quite often,,some wireless software sonthe piece of paper can connect.,So I'll just describe a couplenof things that we've created.,There's lots of differentnthings we've created.,This is one of them, because I love cake.,And this one, it's a large poster,,and you touch it and it hasna little speaker behind it,,and the poster talksnto you when you touch it,and asks you a series of questions,,and it works out your perfect cake.,But it doesn't tell younthe cake there and then.,It uploads a picture,,and the reason why itnchose that cake for you,,to our Facebook page and to Twitter.,So we're trying to create that connection,between the physical and the digital,,but have it not looking on a screen,,and just looking like a regular poster.,We've worked with a bunchnof universities on a project,looking at interactive newsprint.,So for example, we've created a newspaper,,a regular newspaper.,You can wear a pair of headphonesnthat are connected to it wirelessly,,and when you touch it,nyou can hear the music,that's described on the top,nwhich is something you can't read.,You can hear a press conference,as well as readingnwhat the editor has determined,that press conference was about.,And you can press a Facebook "like" button,or you can vote on something as well.,Something else that we created,,and this was an idea that I hadna couple of years ago,,and so we've done a project on this.,It was for funding from the government,for user-centered designnfor energy-efficient buildings,,difficult to say, and somethingnI had no idea what it was,when I went into the workshop,nbut quickly learned.,And we wanted to try and encourage people,to use energy better.,And I really liked the idea that,ninstead of looking at dials,and reading things to say --,looking at your energy usage,,I wanted to create a posternthat was wirelessly connected,and had color-changing inks on it,,and so if your energy usagenwas trending better,,than the leaves would appearnand the rabbits would appear,and all would be good.,And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti,and the leaves would fall off the trees.,So it was trying to makenyou look after something,in your immediate environment,,which you don't want to seennot looking so good,,rather than expecting people to do things,in the local environmentnbecause of the effect,that it has a long way off.,And I think, kind of like goingnback to the farm,,it's about how to let peoplendo what you want them to do,rather than making people donwhat you want them to do.,Okay.,So this is the bit I'm really scared of.,So a couple of things I've created are,,there's a poster over here,that you can play drums on.,And I am not a musician. It seemednlike a good idea at the time.,If anyone wants to trynand play drums, then they can.,I'll just describe how this works.,This poster is wirelesslynconnected to my cell phone,,and when you touch it,nit connects to the app.,(Drums),And it has really good response time.,It's using Bluetooth 4, sonit's pretty instantaneous.,Okay. Thanks.,(Applause),And there's a couple of other things.,So this one is like a sound board,,so you can touch it, and I justnlove these horrible noises.,(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass),Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.,So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,,and this is a softwarenthat's running on the iPad.,Oh, yes. I just love doing that.,I'm not a D.J., though, but I justnalways wanted to do that.,(Scratching),So I have a crossfader,nand I have the two decks.,So I've made some new technology,,and I love things being creative,,and I love working with creative people.,So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,,and she's called Charlotte,,and I asked her to record something,,and I worked with a friend called Elliot,to put some beats together.,So this is my niece, Charlotte.,(Music),Yay!,(Applause),So that's pretty much what I do.,I just love bringing technology together,,having a lot of fun, being creative.,But it's not about the technology.,It's just about, I want to creatensome great experiences.,So thank you very much.,(Applause)Once upon a time,,there was a place called Lesterland.,Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.,Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,,and of that 311 million people,,it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.,If Matt's in the audience,,I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,,this character from your series.,So 144,000 are called Lester,,which means about .05 percent is named Lester.,Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.,There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.,One is called the general election.,The other is called the Lester election.,And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,,but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.,And here's the trick.,In order to run in the general election,,you must do extremely well,in the Lester election.,You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well. 
 Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?,What we can say, number one,,as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,,that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,,because, after all, there is a general election,,but only after the Lesters have had their way,with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.,And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters,is going to produce a subtle, understated,,we could say camouflaged, bending,to keep the Lesters happy.,Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,,but it's dependent upon the Lesters,and dependent upon the people.,It has competing dependencies,,we could say conflicting dependencies,,depending upon who the Lesters are.,Okay. That's Lesterland. 
 Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.,Number one, the United States is Lesterland.,The United States is Lesterland.,The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,,one we called the general election,,the second we should call the money election.,In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,,if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.,In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,,the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,,the trick is, to run in the general election,,you must do extremely well in the money election.,You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.,But you must do extremely well.,And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders,in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland. 
 Now you say, really?,Really .05 percent?,Well, here are the numbers from 2010:,.26 percent of America,gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,,.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,,.01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent --,gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,,and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic,is .000042 percent,— for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans —,gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent,in the cycle we have just seen ending.,So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,,and I say it's fair for me to say,it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.,In this sense, the funders are our Lesters. 
 Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?,Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,,we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence,over the elected officials. We have a general election,,but only after the funders have had their way,with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.,And number two, obviously,,this dependence upon the funders,produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending,to keep the funders happy.,Candidates for Congress and members of Congress,spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time,raising money to get back to Congress,or to get their party back into power,,and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,,these humans, as they spend their time,behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,,but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?,As anyone would, as they do this,,they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness,about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.,They become, in the words of "The X-Files,",shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views,in light of what they know will help them to raise money,,not on issues one to 10,,but on issues 11 to 1,000.,Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,,describes that when she went to Congress,,she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green.",Then to clarify, she went on,,"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter) 
 So here too we have a democracy,,a democracy dependent upon the funders,and dependent upon the people,,competing dependencies,,possibly conflicting dependencies,depending upon who the funders are. 
 Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.,Here's point number two.,The United States is worse than Lesterland,,worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland,if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,,"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,",we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.,You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.,There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,,not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.,We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,,"What could we do to make Lesterland better?",It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.,But in our land, in this land, in USA-land,,there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,,many of them in this room here today,,but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,,because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent,are not comprising it for the public interest.,It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland. 
 And finally, point number three:,Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland,,against the background of its history, its traditions,,in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,,a corruption.,Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash,secreted among members of Congress.,I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.,I don't mean any criminal act.,The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.,It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.,The framers gave us what they called a republic,,but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,,and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,,as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch,that would be dependent upon the people alone. 
 So here's the model of government.,They have the people and the government,with this exclusive dependency,,but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,,no longer a dependence upon the people alone,,increasingly a dependence upon the funders.,Now this is a dependence too,,but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone,so long as the funders are not the people.,This is a corruption. 
 Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.,One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,,equal-opportunity corruption.,It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.,It blocks the right too, as it makes,principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.,So the right wants smaller government.,When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea,for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.,The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,,and as he reported back to me,,the response was, "Hell no!,If we deregulate these guys,,how are we going to raise money from them?" 
 This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,,including the status quo of big and invasive government.,It works against the left and the right,,and that, you might say, is good news. 
 But here's the bad news.,It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,,because in any system,where the members are dependent upon,the tiniest fraction of us for their election,,that means the tiniest number of us,,the tiniest, tiniest number of us,,can block reform.,I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.,I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.,Block reform. 
 Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence,,an economy with lobbyists at the center,which feeds on polarization.,It feeds on dysfunction.,The worse that it is for us,,the better that it is for this fundraising. 
 Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking,at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.",This is the root. 
 Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.,You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.,You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.,You focus on the possible problems,,like eradicating polio from the world,,or taking an image of every single street across the globe,,or building the first real universal translator,,or building a fusion factory in your garage.,These are the manageable problems, so you ignore —,(Laughter) (Applause) —,so you ignore this corruption. 
 But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.,(Applause),We need a government that works.,And not works for the left or the right,,but works for the left and the right,,the citizens of the left and right,,because there is no sensible reform possible,until we end this corruption.,So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.,Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform,or a simpler tax system or inequality.,Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,,look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.,There will never be a Christmas.,We will never get your issue solved,until we fix this issue first.,So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.,Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,,the issue we have to solve before we get to fix,the issues you care about.,No sensible reform, and we cannot afford,a world, a future, with no sensible reform. 
 Okay. So how do we do it?,Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.,If the problem is members spending an extraordinary,amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,,the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising,but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,,to spread it out,,to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea,of dependence upon the people alone.,And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,,changing the First Amendment.,To do this would require a single statute,,a statute establishing what we think of,as small dollar funded elections,,a statute of citizen-funded campaigns,,and there's any number of these proposals out there:,Fair Elections Now Act,,the American Anti-Corruption Act,,an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project,to give vouchers to people to fund elections,,an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.,Each of these would fix this corruption,by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us. 
 The analytics are easy here.,It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,,because this reform would shrink K Street,,and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,,a Democrat from Tennessee, put it,,has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.,Members and staffers and bureaucrats have,an increasingly common business model in their head,,a business model focused on their life after government,,their life as lobbyists.,Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004,left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.,Those numbers have only gone up,,and as United Republic calculated last April,,the average increase in salary for those who they tracked,was 1,452 percent.,So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?,Now I get this skepticism. 
 I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.,But I don't buy it.,This is a solvable issue.,If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve,in the 20th century,,issues like racism, or sexism,,or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,,those are hard issues.,You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.,It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,,out of the soul of a people.,But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.,Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,,and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems,have seen overnight a change in the practice.,When Connecticut adopted this system,,in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives,gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.,It's solvable,,not by being a Democrat,,not by being a Republican.,It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,,by being TEDizens.,Because if you want to kickstart reform,,look, I could kickstart reform,at half the price of fixing energy policy,,I could give you back a republic. 
 Okay. But even if you're not yet with me,,even if you believe this is impossible,,what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me,as I've spoken about this issue again and again is,,even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.,Irrelevant.,I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,,I write in my book, and she said to me,,"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.,There's nothing we can do.",When she said that, I scrambled.,I tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?,What is that sense of hopelessness?",And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.,And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,,"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.,Nothing you can do.",So would I do nothing?,Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?,I'm going off to build Google Glass.,Of course not. I would do everything I could,,and I would do everything I could because this is what love means,,that the odds are irrelevant and that you do,whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.,And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals,love this country. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so when the pundits and the politicians,say that change is impossible,,what this love of country says back is,,"That's just irrelevant.",We lose something dear,,something everyone in this room loves and cherishes,,if we lose this republic, and so we act,with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong. 
 So here's my question:,Do you have that love?,Do you have that love?,Because if you do,,then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing? 
 When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention,in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,,"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?",Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it.",A republic. A representative democracy.,A government dependent upon the people alone.,We have lost that republic.,All of us have to act to get it back. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)I made a film that was impossible to make,,but I didn't know it was impossible,,and that's how I was able to do it. 
 "Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.,It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.,No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before,because it's expensive, it's set in the future,,and it's got tons of visual effects,,and it's shot on green screen.,Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make,ever since I was a kid, really,,back when I was reading some comic books,and dreaming about what the future might be. 
 When American producers see my film,,they think that I had a big budget to do it,,like 23 million.,But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.,I did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million. 
 So you might wonder, what's the deal here?,How did I do this?,Well, it's two things. First, it's time.,When you don't have money, you must take time,,and it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril.",The second aspect is love.,I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.,And it seems like every department had nothing,,so they had to rely on our creativity,and turn every problem into an opportunity. 
 And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,,how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity. 
 But let me go back in time a bit.,In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,,but they weren't your usual graphic novels.,They were books telling a science fiction story,through images and text,,and most of the actors who are now starring,in the movie adaptation, they were already involved,in these books portraying characters,into a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way. 
 And one of these actors is the great stage director,and actor Robert Lepage.,And I just love this guy.,I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.,His career I admire a lot.,And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,,and he was kind enough to lend his image,to the character of Eugène Spaak,,who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation,in between time, space, love, music and women.,And he was a perfect fit for the part,,and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.,He was the one who believed in me,and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books,into a film, and to write, direct,,and produce the film myself. 
 And Robert is actually the very first example,of how constraints can boost creativity.,Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.,I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,,and he's really hard to get,,and I wanted him to be in the movie,,to reprise his role in the movie.,But the thing is, had I waited,for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be,a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?,But that's kind of a big problem.,How do you get somebody who is too busy,to star in a movie? 
 Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --,and this is a true story, by the way —,I said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?,Because, you know, he is everywhere,and nowhere on the planet at the same time,,and he's an illuminated being in my mind,,and he's in between reality and virtual reality,,so it would make perfect sense,to turn this guy into a hologram." 
 Everybody around the table laughed,,but the joke was kind of a good solution,,so that's what we ended up doing. 
 Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.,He was dressed in green and he was like,in a green aquarium.,Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,,so that in post-production we could use,pretty much any angle we needed,,and we shot only his head.,Six months later there was a guy on set,,a mime portraying the body,,the vehicle for the head.,And he was wearing a green hood,so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction,and replace it with Robert Lepage's head.,So he became like a renaissance man,,and here's what it looks like in the movie.

 Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments,that you see in this excerpt,,they're my second example of how,constraints can boost creativity,,because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.,They are objects of desire.,They are imaginary musical instruments.,And they carry a nice story with them.,Actually, I knew what these things would look like,in my mind for many, many years.,But my problem was, I didn't have the money,to pay for them. I couldn't afford them.,So that's kind of a big problem too.,How do you get something that you can't afford? 
 And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.,I said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?",(Laughter) 
 But who on Earth would be interested,by seven not-yet-built musical instruments,inspired by women's bodies?,And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,,because who better to understand the kind of,crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?,So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,,and I presented my crazy idea to him,with sketches like this and visual references,,and something pretty amazing happened.,Guy was interested by this idea,not because I was asking for his money,,but because I came to him with a good idea,in which everybody was happy.,It was kind of a perfect triangle,in which the art buyer was happy,because he got the instruments at a cheaper price,,because they weren't even made.,He took a leap of faith.,And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,,he was happy too because he had a dream project,to work on for a year.,And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments,in my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.,So here they are. 
 And my last example of how constraints,can boost creativity,comes from the green,,because this is a weird color, a crazy color,,and you need to replace the green screens eventually,and you must figure that out sooner rather than later.,And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind,as to what the world would be,,but then again I turned to my childhood imagination,and went to the work of Belgian comic book master,François Schuiten in Belgium.,And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,,and I wanted him to be involved in the movie,as a production designer.,But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,,the guy is too busy and he will say no.,Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,,I might as well call the real guy and ask him,,and I sent him my books,,and he answered that he was interested,in working on the film with me,because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.,In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.,So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,,drawing every single frame that's in the film,to turn that into Montreal in the future.,And it was an amazing collaboration,to work with this great artist whom I admire. 
 But then, you know, eventually you have to turn,all these drawings into reality.,So, again, my solution was to aim,for the best possible artist that I could think of.,And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois,called Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.,This guy had been lead compositor on such films,as "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,",and other unknown projects like this,,and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,,and I had to convince him,,and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,,he accepted to work on mine.,Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.,So if you don't have money to offer to people,,you must strike their imagination with something,as nice as you can think of. 
 So this is what happened on this movie,,and that's how it got made,,and we went to this very nice postproduction company,in Montreal called Vision Globale,,and they lent their 60 artists to work full time,for six months to do this crazy film. 
 So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas,in your mind, and that people tell you,that it's impossible to make,,well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,,because people have a tendency,to see the problems rather than the final result,,whereas if you start to deal with problems,as being your allies rather than your opponents,,life will start to dance with you,in the most amazing way.,I have experienced it.,And you might end up doing some crazy projects,,and who knows, you might even end up,going to Mars. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is my grandfather.,And this is my son.,My grandfather taught me to work with wood,when I was a little boy,,and he also taught me the idea that,if you cut down a treento turn it into something,,honor that tree's lifenand make it as beautiful,as you possibly can.,My little boy reminded me,that for all the technologynand all the toys in the world,,sometimes just a small block of wood,,if you stack it up tall,,actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.,These are my buildings.,I build all around the world,out of our officenin Vancouver and New York.,And we build buildingsnof different sizes and styles,and different materials,ndepending on where we are.,But wood is the materialnthat I love the most,,and I'm going to tell younthe story about wood.,And part of the reasonnI love it is that every time,people go into my buildings that are wood,,I notice they reactncompletely differently.,I've never seen anybody walkninto one of my buildings,and hug a steel or a concrete column,,but I've actually seennthat happen in a wood building.,I've actually seennhow people touch the wood,,and I think there's a reason for it.,Just like snowflakes,nno two pieces of wood,can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.,That's a wonderful thing.,I like to think that wood,gives Mother Naturenfingerprints in our buildings.,It's MothernNature's fingerprints that make,our buildings connect us to naturenin the built environment.,Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest,that grows to 33 stories tall.,Down the coast herenin California, the redwood forest,grows to 40 stories tall.,But the buildingsnthat we think about in wood,are only four stories tallnin most places on Earth.,Even building codes actually limitnthe ability for us to build,much taller than fournstories in many places,,and that's true here in the United States.,Now there are exceptions,,but there needs to be some exceptions,,and things are goingnto change, I'm hoping.,And the reason I think that way is that,today half of us live in cities,,and that number is goingnto grow to 75 percent.,Cities and density mean that our buildings,are going to continue to be big,,and I think there's a rolenfor wood to play in cities.,And I feel that waynbecause three billion people,in the world today,nover the next 20 years,,will need a new home.,That's 40 percent of the worldnthat are going to need,a new building built for themnin the next 20 years.,Now, one in three peoplenliving in cities today,actually live in a slum.,That's one billion peoplenin the world live in slums.,A hundred million peoplenin the world are homeless.,The scale of the challenge for architects,and for society to deal with in building,is to find a solutionnto house these people.,But the challenge is,nas we move to cities,,cities are built in these two materials,,steel and concrete,nand they're great materials.,They're the materials of the last century.,But they're also materialsnwith very high energy,and very high greenhouse gasnemissions in their process.,Steel represents about three percent,of man's greenhouse gas emissions,,and concrete is over five percent.,So if you think about that, eight percent,of our contributionnto greenhouse gases today,comes from those two materials alone.,We don't think about itna lot, and unfortunately,,we actually don't even thinknabout buildings, I think,,as much as we should.,This is a U.S. statisticnabout the impact of greenhouse gases.,Almost half of our greenhouse gasesnare related to the building industry,,and if we look at energy,nit's the same story.,You'll notice that transportation's sortnof second down that list,,but that's the conversationnwe mostly hear about.,And although a lotnof that is about energy,,it's also so much about carbon.,The problem I see is that, ultimately,,the clash of how we solve that problem,of serving those three billion peoplenthat need a home,,and climate change,nare a head-on collision,about to happen, or already happening.,That challenge means that we havento start thinking in new ways,,and I think wood is goingnto be part of that solution,,and I'm going to tellnyou the story of why.,As an architect, woodnis the only material,,big material, that I can build with,that's already grownnby the power of the sun.,When a tree grows in the forestnand gives off oxygen,and soaks up carbon dioxide,,and it dies and it fallsnto the forest floor,,it gives that carbon dioxide backnto the atmosphere or into the ground.,If it burns in a forest fire,nit's going to give that carbon,back to the atmosphere as well.,But if you take that woodnand you put it into a building,or into a piece of furniturenor into that wooden toy,,it actually has an amazing capacity,to store the carbon and providenus with a sequestration.,One cubic meter of wood will store,one tonne of carbon dioxide.,Now our two solutionsnto climate are obviously,to reduce our emissions and find storage.,Wood is the only majornmaterial building material,I can build with that actuallyndoes both those two things.,So I believe that we have,an ethic that the Earth grows our food,,and we need to movento an ethic in this century,that the Earth should grow our homes.,Now, how are we going to do that,when we're urbanizing at this rate,and we think about woodnbuildings only at four stories?,We need to reduce the concretenand steel and we need,to grow bigger,nand what we've been working on,is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.,We've been engineeringnthem with an engineer,named Eric Karsh who works with me on it,,and we've been doing this new work because,there are new wood productsnout there for us to use,,and we call them mass timber panels.,These are panels made with young trees,,small growth trees, small pieces of wood,glued together to makenpanels that are enormous:,eight feet wide, 64 feet long,nand of various thicknesses.,The way I describe thisnbest, I've found, is to say,that we're all usednto two-by-four construction,when we think about wood.,That's what people jumpnto as a conclusion.,Two-by-four constructionnis sort of like the little,eight-dot bricks of Legonthat we all played with as kids,,and you can make all kindsnof cool things out of Lego,at that size, and out of two-by-fours.,But do remember when you were a kid,,and you kind of siftednthrough the pile in your basement,,and you found that bign24-dot brick of Lego,,and you were kind of like,,"Cool, this is awesome. I cannbuild something really big,,and this is going to be great.",That's the change.,Mass timber panelsnare those 24-dot bricks.,They're changing the scalenof what we can do,,and what we've developednis something we call FFTT,,which is a Creative Commons solution,to building a very flexible system,of building with these largenpanels where we tilt up,six stories at a time if we want to.,This animation shows younhow the building goes together,in a very simple way, but thesenbuildings are available,for architects and engineersnnow to build on,for different cultures in the world,,different architecturalnstyles and characters.,In order for us to build safely,,we've engineered thesenbuildings, actually,,to work in a Vancouver context,,where we're a high seismic zone,,even at 30 stories tall.,Now obviously, every time I bring this up,,people even, you know, herenat the conference, say,,"Are you serious? Thirty stories?nHow's that going to happen?",And there's a lot of reallyngood questions that are asked,and important questionsnthat we spent quite a long time,working on the answersnto as we put together,our report and the peer reviewed report.,I'm just going to focus on a few of them,,and let's start with fire,nbecause I think fire,is probably the first one that you'renall thinking about right now.,Fair enough.,And the way I describe it is this.,If I asked you to takena match and light it,and hold up a log and trynto get that log to go on fire,,it doesn't happen, right?nWe all know that.,But to build a fire, you kindnof start with small pieces,of wood and you work your way up,,and eventually you cannadd the log to the fire,,and when you do add the lognto the fire, of course,,it burns, but it burns slowly.,Well, mass timber panels,nthese new products,that we're using, are much like the log.,It's hard to start themnon fire, and when they do,,they actually burnnextraordinarily predictably,,and we can use fire sciencenin order to predict,and make these buildingsnas safe as concrete,and as safe as steel.,The next big issue, deforestation.,Eighteen percent of our contribution,to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide,is the result of deforestation.,The last thing we wantnto do is cut down trees.,Or, the last thing we want to donis cut down the wrong trees.,There are models for sustainable forestry,that allow us to cut trees properly,,and those are the only trees appropriate,to use for these kinds of systems.,Now I actually think that these ideas,will change the economicsnof deforestation.,In countries with deforestation issues,,we need to find a way to provide,better value for the forest,and actually encouragenpeople to make money,through very fast growth cycles --,10-, 12-, 15-year-old treesnthat make these products,and allow us to build at this scale.,We've calculated a 20-story building:,We'll grow enough wood in NorthnAmerica every 13 minutes.,That's how much it takes.,The carbon story herenis a really good one.,If we built a 20-story buildingnout of cement and concrete,,the process would resultnin the manufacturing,of that cement and 1,200ntonnes of carbon dioxide.,If we did it in wood, in this solution,,we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,,for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.,That's the equivalent of about 900 cars,removed from the road in one year.,Think back to that three billion people,that need a new home,,and maybe thisnis a contributor to reducing.,We're at the beginningnof a revolution, I hope,,in the way we build, because thisnis the first new way,to build a skyscrapernin probably 100 years or more.,But the challenge is changingnsociety's perception,of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.,The engineering is, truthfully,nthe easy part of this.,And the way I describe it is this.,The first skyscraper, technically --,and the definition of a skyscraper is 10nstories tall, believe it or not —,but the first skyscrapernwas this one in Chicago,,and people were terrified to walknunderneath this building.,But only four years after it was built,,Gustave Eiffel was buildingnthe Eiffel Tower,,and as he built the Eiffel Tower,,he changed the skylinesnof the cities of the world,,changed and created a competition,between places like NewnYork City and Chicago,,where developers started buildingnbigger and bigger buildings,and pushing the envelopenup higher and higher,with better and better engineering.,We built this model in New York, actually,,as a theoretical model on the campus,of a technical university soon to come,,and the reason we picked this site,to just show you what thesenbuildings may look like,,because the exterior can change.,It's really just the structurenthat we're talking about.,The reason we picked it is because thisnis a technical university,,and I believe that wood is the most,technologically advancednmaterial I can build with.,It just happens to be that MothernNature holds the patent,,and we don't really feelncomfortable with it.,But that's the way it should be,,nature's fingerprintsnin the built environment.,I'm looking for this opportunity,to create an Eiffel Towernmoment, we call it.,Buildings are startingnto go up around the world.,There's a building in Londonnthat's nine stories,,a new building that justnfinished in Australia,that I believe is 10 or 11.,We're starting to push the heightnup of these wood buildings,,and we're hoping, and I'm hoping,,that my hometown of Vancouvernactually potentially,announces the world's tallestnat around 20 stories,in the not-so-distant future.,That Eiffel Tower momentnwill break the ceiling,,these arbitrary ceilings of height,,and allow wood buildingsnto join the competition.,And I believe the race is ultimately on.,Thank you.,(Applause)This is where I live. I live in Kenya,,at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.,Those are my dad's cows at the back,,and behind the cows,,that's the Nairobi National Park.,Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,,which means wild animals like zebras,migrate out of the park freely.,So predators like lions follow them,,and this is what they do.,They kill our livestock.,This is one of the cows which was killed at night,,and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,,and I felt so bad,,because it was the only bull we had. 
 My community, the Maasai, we believe that,we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land,for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.,So I grew up hating lions so much.,The morans are the warriors,who protect our community and the livestock,,and they're also upset about this problem.,So they kill the lions.,It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.,And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. 
 So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community,is responsible for his dad's cows,,and that's the same thing which happened to me. 
 So I had to find a way of solving this problem.,And the first idea I got was to use fire,,because I thought lions were scared of fire.,But I came to realize that that didn't really help,,because it was even helping the lions,to see through the cowshed.,So I didn't give up. I continued.,And a second idea I got was,to use a scarecrow.,I was trying to trick the lions,[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.,But lions are very clever. (Laughter),They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,,but the second day, they'll come and they say,,this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter),So he jumps in and kills the animals.,So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,,and that day, the lions didn't come.,And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.,So I had an idea.,Since I was a small boy,,I used to work in my room for the whole day,,and I even took apart my mom's new radio,,and that day she almost killed me,,but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter),So I got an old car battery,,an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,,and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.,And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.,And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. 
 So I set up everything.,As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,,and the battery supplies the power,to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.,And the indicator box makes the lights flash.,As you can see, the bulbs face outside,,because that's where the lions come from.,And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.,The lights flash and trick,the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,,but I was sleeping in my bed. 
 (Laughter),(Applause),Thanks. 
 So I set it up in my home two years ago,,and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.,And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.,One of them was this grandmother.,She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,,and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.,And I said, "Yes.",So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.,Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,,and they're really working.,And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya,for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,,and it's also being used,to scare elephants away from people's farms. 
 Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship,in one of the best schools in Kenya,,Brookhouse International School,,and I'm really excited about this.,My new school now is coming in and helping,by fundraising and creating an awareness.,I even took my friends back to my community,,and we're installing the lights to the homes,which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. 
 So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland,herding my father's cows,,and I used to see planes flying over,,and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.,And here I am today.,I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.,So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. 
 I used to hate lions, but now because my invention,is saving my father's cows and the lions,,we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.,Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is,to hear a story like yours.,So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep. 
 CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.,What's the next one on your list? 
 RT: My next invention is,,I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?,RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,,but I want to make mine.,(Laughter) 
 CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,,but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter) 
 CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.,We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.,Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)Let's talk dirty.,A few years ago, oddly enough,,I needed the bathroom,,and I found one, a public bathroom,,and I went into the stall,,and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:,use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.,And for some reason that day, instead,,I asked myself a question,,and it was, where does this stuff go?,And with that question, I found myself plunged,into the world of sanitation --,there's more coming -- (Laughter) —,sanitation, toilets and poop,,and I have yet to emerge.,And that's because it's such an enraging,,yet engaging place to be. 
 To go back to that toilet,,it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,,it wasn't as nice as this one,from the World Toilet Organization.,That's the other WTO. (Laughter),But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,,it had soap so I could wash my hands,,and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 But that day, when I asked that question,,I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking,that a toilet like that was my right,,when in fact it's a privilege.,2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.,They don't have a bucket or a box.,Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.,And they have to do what this little boy is doing,by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,,which is called open defecation,,or poo-pooing in the open.,And he does that every day,,and every day, probably, that guy in the picture,walks on by,,because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him. 
 But he should, because the problem,with all that poop lying around,is that poop carries passengers.,Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.,All those things, the eggs, the cysts,,the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel,in one gram of human feces.,How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.,He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,,and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food,and his environment,with whatever diseases he may be carrying,by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.,In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world,that most of us in this room are lucky to live in,,the most common symptoms associated with those diseases,,diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.,It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.,Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,,as a legacy of empire.,But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea,in a leading photo image agency,,this is the picture that you come up with.,(Laughter),Still not sure about the bikini.,And here's another image of diarrhea.,This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.,You can't see her, because she's buried,under that green grass in a little village in Liberia,,because she died in three days from diarrhea --,the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.,And that's her dad.,But she wasn't alone that day,,because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,,and they do every day.,Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,,and you've probably been asked to care about things,like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,,but diarrhea kills more children,than all those three things put together.,It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.,And the cost to the world is immense:,260 billion dollars lost every year,on the losses to poor sanitation.,These are cholera beds in Haiti.,You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.,It gets a fraction of the attention and funding,given to any of those other diseases. 
 But we know how to fix this.,We know, because in the mid-19th century,,wonderful Victorian engineers,installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment,and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.,Child mortality dropped by the most,it had ever dropped in history.,The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance,of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,,and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,,and surgery.,It's a wonderful waste disposal device. 
 But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell,,we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door —,and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.,We don't have a neutral word for it.,Poop's not particularly adequate.,Shit offends people. Feces is too medical. 
 Because I can't explain otherwise,,when I look at the figures, what's going on.,We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,,but if you look at the budgets of countries,,developing and developed,,you'll think there's something wrong with the math,,because you'll expect absurdities like,Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military,than it does on water and sanitation,,even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea,in Pakistan every year.,But then you look at that already minuscule,water and sanitation budget,,and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,,which is great; we all need water.,No one's going to refuse clean water.,But the humble latrine, or flush toilet,,reduces disease by twice as much,as just putting in clean water.,Think about it. That little boy,who's running back into his house,,he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,,but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with. 
 And I think that the real waste of human waste,is that we are wasting it as a resource,and as an incredible trigger for development,,because these are a few things that toilets,and poop itself can do for us.,So a toilet can put a girl back in school.,Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school,because they have no adequate sanitation.,They've been used to sitting through lessons,for years and years holding it in.,We've all done that, but they do it every day,,and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,,it just gets too much.,And I understand that. Who can blame them?,So if you met an educationalist and said,,"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent,with just one simple thing,",you'd make a lot of friends in education. 
 That's not the only thing it can do for you.,Poop can cook your dinner.,It's got nutrients in it.,We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.,We don't keep them all.,In Rwanda, they are now getting,75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system,from the contents of prisoners' bowels.,So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.,They're genocidal inmates, most of them,,and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,,because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,,pretty much like a stomach,,then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,,and you can cook with it.,And you might think it's just good karma,to see these guys stirring shit,,but it's also good economic sense,,because they're saving a million dollars a year.,They're cutting down on deforestation,,and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,,infinite and free at the point of production. 
 It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.,Here's a woman who's about to get a dose,of the brown stuff in those syringes,,which is what you think it is,,except not quite, because it's actually donated.,There is now a new career path called stool donor.,It's like the new sperm donor.,Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,,and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.,She's been suffering for years.,She gets a dose of healthy human feces,,and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.,It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.,Maybe it's the ick factor.,That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists,in Canada who have now created a stool sample,,a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate. 
 So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,,we give everyone a toilet.,And this is where it gets really interesting,,because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.,So the really interesting, exciting work --,this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that,we need to understand human psychology.,We need to understand software,as well as just giving someone hardware.,They've found in many developing countries that,governments have gone in and given out free latrines,and gone back a few years later and found that they've,got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms,with their owners happily walking past them,and going over to the open defecating ground. 
 So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.,It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it,in the early 20th century.,They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.,They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.,In India now there's a campaign,which persuades young brides,not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.,It's called "No Loo, No I Do.",(Laughter),And in case you think that poster's just propaganda,,here's Priyanka, 23 years old.,I met her last October in India,,and she grew up in a conservative environment.,She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,,and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,,she moved into her in-law's house.,And she was horrified to get there and find,that they didn't have a toilet.,She'd grown up with a latrine.,It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.,And the first night she was there, she was told,that at 4 o'clock in the morning --,her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside,and go and do it in the dark in the open.,And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.,She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.,After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.,She left.,And if you know anything about rural India,,you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.,But not just that.,She got her toilet, and now she goes around,all the other villages in India,persuading other women to do the same thing.,It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful,and really exciting. 
 Another version of this, another village in India,near where Priyanka lives,is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,,it had no toilets whatsoever.,Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.,Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks,like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit,and watching the flies go one to the other.,Somehow, people who'd been thinking,that what they were doing was not disgusting at all,suddenly thought, "Oops.",Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.,That's what really made them change their behavior.,So this woman, this boy's mother,installed this latrine in a few hours.,Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,,but she installed the latrine in a few hours.,It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life. 
 So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,,even though these are pretty exciting times,because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,reinventing the toilet, which is great,,we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,,which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.,But there are things to worry about.,It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.,It's about 50 or so years off track.,We're not going to meet targets,,providing people with sanitation at this rate.,So when I get sad about sanitation,,I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago,was a nation of people who used pit latrines,and wiped with sticks,,and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,,washlet toilets.,They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,,hands-free cleaning experience,,and they have various other features,like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device,which is known as the "marriage-saver.",(Laughter) 
 But most importantly, what they have done in Japan,,which I find so inspirational,,is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.,They've made it conversational.,People go out and upgrade their toilet.,They talk about it. They've sanitized it.,I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.,All we really need to do,is look at this issue,as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.,And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.,Our sewers are crumbling.,Things are going wrong here too.,The solution to all of this is pretty easy.,I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon,and just ask you to do one thing,,and that's to go out, protest,,speak about the unspeakable,,and talk shit. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle,that weighs less than a bicycle,,that you can carry with you anywhere,,that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,,and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers,on about a dollar of electricity.,But when I say the word electric vehicle,,people think about vehicles. They think about cars,and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.,But if you come about it from a different perspective,,you can create some more interesting,,more novel concepts. 
 So we built something.,I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.,So this is the motor.,This motor has enough power to take you,up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,,about 30 kilometers an hour,,and this battery, this battery right here,has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,,which is enough to cover about half of the car trips,in the U.S. alone.,But the best part about these components,is that we bought them at a toy store.,These are from remote control airplanes.,And the performance of these things has gotten so good,that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,,you can really change things. 
 So today we're going to show you one example,of how you can use this.,Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is,,but also how the portability that comes with this,can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco. 
 (Music),[6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph],[Uphill Climbing],[Regenerative Braking] 
 (Applause),(Cheers) 
 So we're going to show you what this thing can do.,It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,,so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,,go in reverse if you like, also have braking.,It's incredible just how light this thing is.,I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you,anywhere you go. 
 So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts,about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.,This uses 20 times less energy,for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,,which means not only is this thing fast to charge,and really cheap to build,,but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use,in terms of your transportation.,So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed,for each person in this room to get around in a city,,now you can look at much smaller amounts,and more sustainable transportation. 
 So next time you think about a vehicle,,I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Okay, it's great to be back at TED.,Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?

 Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.,He needs help getting 10 million dollars.,I like to pay attention to these,because that's how we originally funded the company,,and it's gone pretty well. 
 Though in all seriousness,,this position that you just saw me in,,looking down at my phone,,that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.,Because we ultimately questioned,whether this is the ultimate future,of how you want to connect to other people in your life,,how you want to connect to information.,Should it be by just walking around looking down?,But that was the vision behind Glass,,and that's why we've created this form factor.,Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot,,but I want to tell you a little bit more,about the motivation behind what led to it.,In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself,when you're out and about looking at your phone,,it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?,You're standing around there,and you're just rubbing,this featureless piece of glass.,You're just kind of moving around. 
 So when we developed Glass, we thought really about,,can we make something that frees your hands?,You saw all of the things people are doing,in the video back there.,They were all wearing Glass,,and that's how we got that footage. 
 And also you want something that frees your eyes.,That's why we put the display up high,,out of your line of sight,,so it wouldn't be where you're looking,and it wouldn't be where you're making,eye contact with people. 
 And also we wanted to free up the ears,,so the sound actually goes through,,conducts straight to the bones in your cranium,,which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.,And ironically, if you want to hear it better,,you actually just cover your ear,,which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works. 
 My vision when we started Google 15 years ago,was that eventually you wouldn't,have to have a search query at all.,You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.,And this is now, 15 years later,,sort of the first form factor,that I think can deliver that vision,when you're out and about on the street,talking to people and so forth. 
 This project has lasted now, been just over two years.,We've learned an amazing amount.,It's been really important to make it comfortable.,So our first prototypes we built were huge.,It was like cell phones strapped to your head.,It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.,We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer,until she actually accepted the job,,and then she almost ran away screaming.,But we've come a long way. 
 And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.,Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,,but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments,spent with my family, my kids.,I just never would have dug out a camera,or a phone or something else to take that moment. 
 And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,,that I also kind of have a nervous tic.,The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,,but it's also kind of a nervous habit.,Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.,I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.,You know, I'd be like --,But in this case, you know, I whip this out,and I sit there and look as if I have something,very important to do or attend to.,But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life,I spent just secluding away,,be it email or social posts or whatnot,,even though it wasn't really --,there's nothing really that important or that pressing.,And with this, I know I will get certain messages,if I really need them,,but I don't have to be checking them all the time. 
 Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more,,doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video. 
 Thank you all very much. 
 (Applause)Well, I have a big announcement to make today,,and I'm really excited about this.,And this may be a little bit of a surprise,to many of you who know my research,and what I've done well.,I've really tried to solve some big problems:,counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,,and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,,but I started thinking about all these problems,,and I realized that the really biggest problem we face,,what all these other problems come down to,,is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.,And I decided that I was going to set out,to try to solve this problem. 
 And this probably is not what you're expecting.,You're probably expecting me to come up here,and talk about fusion,,because that's what I've done most of my life.,But this is actually a talk about, okay --,(Laughter) —,but this is actually a talk about fission.,It's about perfecting something old,,and bringing something old into the 21st century. 
 Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.,In a nuclear power plant, you have,a big pot of water that's under high pressure,,and you have some fuel rods,,and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,,and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,,and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,,and that reaction heats up water,,the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,,and you produce electricity from it.,This is the same way we've been producing electricity,,the steam turbine idea, for 100 years,,and nuclear was a really big advancement,in a way to heat the water,,but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine. 
 And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?,Is fission kind of played out,,or is there something left to innovate here?,And I realized that I had hit upon something,that I think has this huge potential to change the world.,And this is what it is. 
 This is a small modular reactor.,So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.,This is between 50 and 100 megawatts.,But that's a ton of power.,That's between, say at an average use,,that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.,Now the really interesting thing about these reactors,is they're built in a factory.,So they're modular reactors that are built,essentially on an assembly line,,and they're trucked anywhere in the world,,you plop them down, and they produce electricity.,This region right here is the reactor. 
 And this is buried below ground, which is really important.,For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,,I can't extol to you,how great having something buried below the ground is,for proliferation and security concerns. 
 And inside this reactor is a molten salt,,so anybody who's a fan of thorium,,they're going to be really excited about this,,because these reactors happen to be really good,at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,,uranium-233. 
 But I'm not really concerned about the fuel.,You can run these off -- they're really hungry,,they really like down-blended weapons pits,,so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium,that's been down-blended.,It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,,but they love this stuff.,And we have a lot of it sitting around,,because this is a big problem.,You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal,of nuclear weapons, and that was great,,and we don't need them anymore,,and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?,What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?,Well, we're securing them, and it would be great,if we could burn them, eat them up,,and this reactor loves this stuff. 
 So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,,and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,,the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.,It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.,And then that's a heat exchanger,to what makes this design really, really interesting,,and that's a heat exchanger to a gas.,So going back to what I was saying before about all power,being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic --,being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,,that's actually not that efficient, and in fact,,in a nuclear power plant like this,,it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.,That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out,to how much electricity it's producing.,And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors,operate at pretty low temperature.,They operate anywhere from, you know,,maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.,And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,,which means the higher the temperature you go to,,thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.,And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,,so supercritical CO2 or helium,,and that goes into a turbine,,and this is called the Brayton cycle.,This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,,and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,,between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.,And I'm really excited about this,,because it's a very compact core.,Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature,,but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out,for how much uranium you're fissioning,,not to mention the fact that these burn up.,Their burn-up is much higher.,So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,,a lot more of it's being used. 
 And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this,is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,,and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.,Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,,and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.,So you have what's called the xenon pit,,and so some of these fission products love neutrons.,They love the neutrons that are going on,and helping this reaction take place.,And they eat them up, which means that, combined with,the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,,you can only run one of these reactors,for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.,So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,,which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,,because it means it's a sealed system.,No refueling means you can seal them up,and they're not going to be a proliferation risk,,and they're not going to have,either nuclear material or radiological material,proliferated from their cores. 
 But let's go back to safety, because everybody,after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,,and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor,was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,,and I'm really excited about this reactor,for essentially two reasons.,One, it doesn't operate at high pressure.,So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor,or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water,at very high pressures, and this means, essentially,,in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach,of this stainless steel pressure vessel,,the coolant would leave the core.,These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,,so there's no inclination for the fission products,to leave the reactor in the event of an accident.,Also, they operate at high temperatures,,and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,,but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,,or you lost off-site power in the case,of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.,Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,,you could actually just drain the core,into what's called a sub-critical setting,,basically a tank underneath the reactor,that has some neutrons absorbers.,And this is really important, because the reaction stops.,In this kind of reactor, you can't do that.,The fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,,and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,,Fukushima and Three Mile Island --,looking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while —,but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,,what happens is, when they see high pressure water,,steam, in an oxidizing environment,,they'll actually produce hydrogen,,and that hydrogen has this explosive capability,to release fission products.,So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure,and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,,means that there's no inclination for the fission products,to leave this reactor.,So even in the event of an accident,,yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,,sorry for the power company,,but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.,So I really think that in the, say,,20 years it's going to take us to get fusion,and make fusion a reality,,this could be the source of energy,that provides carbon-free electricity.,Carbon-free electricity. 
 And it's an amazing technology because,not only does it combat climate change,,but it's an innovation.,It's a way to bring power to the developing world,,because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.,You can put them anywhere in the world you want to. 
 And maybe something else.,As a kid, I was obsessed with space.,Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,,but before that I was obsessed with space,,and I was really excited about, you know,,being an astronaut and designing rockets,,which was something that was always exciting to me.,But I think I get to come back to this,,because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket,that produces 50 to 100 megawatts.,That is the rocket designer's dream.,That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.,Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts,to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,,but you have power once you get there.,You know, rocket designers who use solar panels,or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts --,wow, that's a lot of power.,I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.,That's a ton of power.,That could power a Martian community.,That could power a rocket there.,And so I hope that,maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore,my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion. 
 And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,,and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?",But we launch plutonium batteries all the time.,Everybody was really excited about Curiosity,,and that had this big plutonium battery on board,that has plutonium-238,,which actually has a higher specific activity,than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,,which means that the effects would be negligible,,because you launch it cold,,and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor. 
 So I'm really excited.,I think that I've designed this reactor here,that can be an innovative source of energy,,provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,,and I'm really prepared to do this.,I graduated high school in May, and --,(Laughter) (Applause) —,I graduated high school in May,,and I decided that I was going to start up a company,to commercialize these technologies that I've developed,,these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers,and these systems to produce medical isotopes,,but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up,a team of some of the most incredible people,I've ever had the chance to work with,,and I'm really prepared to make this a reality.,And I think, I think, that looking at the technology,,this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,,and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,,which is an advantage for the developing world. 
 And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing,to end with, which is weird for a scientist.,But I think there's something really poetic,about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,,because the stars are giant fusion reactors.,They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.,The energy that I'm able to talk to you today,,while it was converted to chemical energy in my food,,originally came from a nuclear reaction,,and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,,perfecting nuclear fission,and using it as a future source of innovative energy. 
 So thank you guys. 
 (Applause)How many of you have checked your email today?,Come on, raise your hands.,How many of you are checking it right now? 
 (Laughter) 
 And how about finances? Anybody check that today?,Credit card, investment account?,How about this week? 
 Now, how about your household energy use?,Anybody check that today?,This week? Last week?,A few energy geeks spread out across the room.,It's good to see you guys.,But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people,who are passionate about the future of this planet,,and even we aren't paying attention,to the energy use that's driving climate change.,The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.,We met her on our first family vacation.,Harriet's paying attention to her energy use,,and she is decidedly not an energy geek.,This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention. 
 This is coal,,the most common source of electricity on the planet,,and there's enough energy in this coal,to light this bulb for more than a year.,But unfortunately, between here and here,,most of that energy is lost to things,like transmission leakage and heat.,In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.,So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.,If you wanted to light this bulb for a year,,you'd need this much coal.,The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,,we waste nine.,That means there's good news,,because for every unit of energy we save,,we save the other nine.,So the question is, how can we get the people in this room,and across the globe to start paying attention,to the energy we're using,,and start wasting less of it? 
 The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment,that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,,and only 90 miles from here,,in San Marcos, California.,Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,,asking people to turn off their air conditioning,and turn on their fans.,One quarter of the homes received a message that said,,did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?,Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.,Another group got an environmental message.,And still a third group got a message about,being good citizens, preventing blackouts.,Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.,In fact, none of these messages worked.,They had zero impact on energy consumption.,It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all. 
 But there was a fourth message,,and this message simply said,,"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors,said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.,Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning,and turn on your fans.",And wouldn't you know it, they did.,The people who received this message,showed a marked decrease in energy consumption,simply by being told what their neighbors were doing. 
 So what does this tell us?,Well, if something is inconvenient,,even if we believe in it,,moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us --,but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.,And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.,In fact, it already is. 
 Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I,started a company called Opower.,We built software and partnered with utility companies,who wanted to help their customers save energy.,We deliver personalized home energy reports,that show people how their consumption,compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.,Just like those effective door hangers,,we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,,and then we give everyone targeted recommendations,to help them save.,We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,,web, and now even a controllable thermostat,,and for the last five years we've been running,the largest behavioral science experiment in the world. 
 And it's working.,Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved,more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,,and we're just getting started.,This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities,in six countries, we're going to generate,another two terawatt hours of electricity savings. 
 Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,,but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours,is more than enough energy to power every home,in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined,for more than a year.,Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half,what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.,And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,,we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows,every minute around the clock every day for an entire year,to get two terawatt hours of electricity.,And we're not burning anything.,We're just motivating people to pay attention,and change their behavior. 
 But we're just one company, and this is just,scratching the surface.,Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,,and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have,inefficient lightbulbs. They may.,I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,,and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.,That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted,on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being,but does contribute to climate change.,That's 40 billion -- with a B --,every year in the U.S. alone.,That's half our coal usage right there. 
 Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists,are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources,like these,,and this is both fantastic and essential.,But the most overlooked resource to get us,to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.,It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.,And we can harness this resource,with no new material science,simply by applying behavioral science.,We can do it today, we know it works,,and it will save us money right away. 
 So what are we waiting for?,Well, in most places, utility regulation,hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.,Utilities are still rewarded when their customers,waste energy.,They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it. 
 But this story is much more than about household energy use.,Take a look at the Prius.,It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science,but because they invested in behavioral science.,The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy,they're saving in real time,makes former speed demons,drive more like cautious grandmothers. 
 Which brings us back to Harriet.,We met her on our first family vacation.,She came over to meet my young daughter,,and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name,is also Harriet.,She asked me what I did for a living,,and I told her, I work with utilities,to help people save energy.,It was then that her eyes lit up. 
 She looked at me, and she said,,"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.,You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter,in the mail from our utility.,It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors.",(Laughter),"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,,talk about, and even argue about,,is what we should be doing to save energy.,We did everything that letter told us to do,,and still I know there must be more.,Now I'm here with a genuine expert.,Tell me. What should I do to save energy?" 
 There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.,My goal is to make sure,we are all asking it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The most massive,tsunami perfect storm,is bearing down upon us.,This perfect storm,is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,,and we are facing that reality,with the full belief,that we can solve our problems with technology,,and that's very understandable.,Now, this perfect storm that we are facing,is the result of our rising population,,rising towards 10 billion people,,land that is turning to desert,,and, of course, climate change. 
 Now there's no question about it at all:,we will only solve the problem,of replacing fossil fuels with technology.,But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --,are by no means the only thing,that is causing climate change. 
 Desertification,is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,,and this happens only when,we create too much bare ground.,There's no other cause.,And I intend to focus,on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. 
 But I have for you a very simple message,that offers more hope than you can imagine.,We have environments,where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.,On those, it is almost impossible,to create vast areas of bare ground.,No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.,And we have environments,where we have months of humidity,followed by months of dryness,,and that is where desertification is occurring.,Fortunately, with space technology now,,we can look at it from space,,and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.,Generally, what you see in green,is not desertifying,,and what you see in brown is,,and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.,About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying. 
 I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert,while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.,Think of it in terms of drums of water,,each containing 200 liters.,Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare,of that land that day.,The next day, the land looked like this.,Where had that water gone?,Some of it ran off as flooding,,but most of the water that soaked into the soil,simply evaporated out again,,exactly as it does in your garden,if you leave the soil uncovered.,Now, because the fate of water and carbon,are tied to soil organic matter,,when we damage soils, you give off carbon.,Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. 
 Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,,that desertification is only occurring,in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,,and that tall grasslands like this one,in high rainfall are of no consequence.,But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,,you find that most of the soil in that grassland,that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,,leading to increased runoff and evaporation.,That is the cancer of desertification,that we do not recognize till its terminal form. 
 Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,,mostly cattle, sheep and goats,,overgrazing the plants,,leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.,Almost everybody knows this,,from nobel laureates to golf caddies,,or was taught it, as I was.,Now, the environments like you see here,,dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,,and I loved wildlife,,and so I grew up hating livestock,because of the damage they were doing.,And then my university education as an ecologist,reinforced my beliefs. 
 Well, I have news for you.,We were once just as certain,that the world was flat.,We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.,And I want to invite you now,to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. 
 When I was a young man,,a young biologist in Africa,,I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas,as future national parks.,Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —,and no sooner did we remove the hunting,,drum-beating people to protect the animals,,than the land began to deteriorate,,as you see in this park that we formed.,Now, no livestock were involved,,but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,,I did the research and I proved we had too many,,and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers,and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.,Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,,and it was political dynamite, frankly.,So our government formed a team of experts,to evaluate my research.,They did. They agreed with me,,and over the following years,,we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.,And it got worse, not better.,Loving elephants as I do,,that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,,and I will carry that to my grave.,One good thing did come out of it.,It made me absolutely determined,to devote my life to finding solutions. 
 When I came to the United States, I got a shock,,to find national parks like this one,desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.,And there'd been no livestock on this land,for over 70 years.,And I found that American scientists,had no explanation for this,except that it is arid and natural.,So I then began looking,at all the research plots I could,over the whole of the Western United States,where cattle had been removed,to prove that it would stop desertification,,but I found the opposite,,as we see on this research station,,where this grassland that was green in 1961,,by 2002 had changed to that situation.,And the authors of the position paper on climate change,from which I obtained these pictures,attribute this change to "unknown processes." 
 Clearly, we have never understood,what is causing desertification,,which has destroyed many civilizations,and now threatens us globally.,We have never understood it.,Take one square meter of soil,and make it bare like this is down here,,and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn,and much hotter at midday,than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,,plant litter.,You have changed the microclimate.,Now, by the time you are doing that,and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground,on more than half the world's land,,you are changing macroclimate.,But we have just simply not understood,why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?,Why has it accelerated lately?,We had no understanding of that. 
 What we had failed to understand,was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,,the soil and the vegetation,developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,,and that these grazing animals,developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.,Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators,is to get into herds,,and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.,Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,,and they have to keep moving,,and it was that movement,that prevented the overgrazing of plants,,while the periodic trampling,ensured good cover of the soil,,as we see where a herd has passed. 
 This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.,It has just come through four months of rain,,and it's now going into eight months of dry season.,And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.,Now, all of that grass you see aboveground,has to decay biologically,before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,,the grassland and the soil begin to die.,Now, if it does not decay biologically,,it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,,and this smothers and kills grasses,,leading to a shift to woody vegetation,and bare soil, releasing carbon.,To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.,But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,,and worse than that,,burning one hectare of grassland,gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants,than 6,000 cars.,And we are burning in Africa, every single year,,more than one billion hectares of grasslands,,and almost nobody is talking about it.,We justify the burning, as scientists,,because it does remove the dead material,and it allows the plants to grow. 
 Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,,what could we do to keep that healthy?,And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.,Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more,without causing desertification and climate change.,We cannot burn it without causing,desertification and climate change.,What are we going to do?,There is only one option,,I'll repeat to you, only one option,left to climatologists and scientists,,and that is to do the unthinkable,,and to use livestock,,bunched and moving,,as a proxy for former herds and predators,,and mimic nature.,There is no other alternative left to mankind. 
 So let's do that.,So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.,We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,,and we've done so, and look at that.,All of that grass is now covering the soil,as dung, urine and litter or mulch,,as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,,and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,,to store carbon, and to break down methane.,And we did that,,without using fire to damage the soil,,and the plants are free to grow. 
 When I first realized,that we had no option as scientists,but to use much-vilified livestock,to address climate change and desertification,,I was faced with a real dilemma.,How were we to do it?,We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists,bunching and moving their animals,,but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.,Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,,and that had accelerated desertification,,as we first discovered in Africa,and then confirmed in the United States,,and as you see in this picture,of land managed by the federal government.,Clearly more was needed,than bunching and moving the animals,,and humans, over thousands of years,,had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.,But we biologists and ecologists,had never tackled anything as complex as this.,So rather than reinvent the wheel,,I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.,And I found there were planning techniques,that I could take and adapt to our biological need,,and from those I developed what we call,holistic management and planned grazing,,a planning process,,and that does address all of nature's complexity,and our social, environmental, economic complexity. 
 Today, we have young women like this one,teaching villages in Africa,how to put their animals together into larger herds,,plan their grazing to mimic nature,,and where we have them hold their animals overnight --,we run them in a predator-friendly manner,,because we have a lot of lands, and so on --,and where they do this and hold them overnight,to prepare the crop fields,,we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. 
 Let's look at some results.,This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.,It has just come through four months of very good rains,it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.,But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,,has evaporated from the soil surface.,Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,,and we have 150,000 people,on almost permanent food aid.,Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,,with the same rainfall, and look at that.,Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.,It's fine.,The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,,everything is now more productive,,and we have virtually no fear of dry years.,And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats,400 percent,,planning the grazing to mimic nature,and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,,giraffe and other animals that we have.,But before we began, our land looked like that.,This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years,regardless of what rain we got.,Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change,as we use livestock to mimic nature.,This was another site,where it had been bare and eroding,,and at the base of the marked small tree,,we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?,And again, watch the change,just using livestock to mimic nature.,And there are fallen trees in there now,,because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.,This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,,and I've had to mark the hill,because the change is so profound. 
 (Applause) 
 I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s,turn the desert that you see on the right there,back to grassland,,and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land,with hope for the future.,And look at the amazing change in this one,,where that gully has completely healed,using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,,and once more, we have the third generation of that family,on that land with their flag still flying. 
 The vast grasslands of Patagonia,are turning to desert as you see here.,The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,,and he has documented the steady decline of that land,over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.,They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,,really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,,and they have documented a 50-percent increase,in the production of the land in the first year. 
 We now have in the violent Horn of Africa,pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature,and openly saying it is the only hope they have,of saving their families and saving their culture.,Ninety-five percent of that land,can only feed people from animals. 
 I remind you that I am talking about,most of the world's land here that controls our fate,,including the most violent region of the world,,where only animals can feed people,from about 95 percent of the land.,What we are doing globally is causing climate change,as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,,and maybe more than fossil fuels.,But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,,violence, social breakdown and war,,and as I am talking to you,,millions of men, women and children,are suffering and dying.,And if this continues,,we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,,even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. 
 I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature,at very low cost,to reverse all this.,We are already doing so,on about 15 million hectares,on five continents,,and people who understand,far more about carbon than I do,calculate that, for illustrative purposes,,if we do what I am showing you here,,we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere,and safely store it in the grassland soils,for thousands of years,,and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands,that I've shown you,,we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,,while feeding people.,I can think of almost nothing,that offers more hope for our planet,,for your children,,and their children, and all of humanity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you, Chris. 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,,and I'm sure everyone here has,,A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.,I'm just going to ask you one quick question.,When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,,it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?,How do you start? 
 Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,,and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed,is during mine reclamation,,where it's 100 percent bare.,But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,,where I offered a £5 note,in a hundred-mile drive,if somebody could find one grass,in a hundred-mile drive,,and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,,the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,,just by the movement, mimicking nature,,and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.,It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that. 
 CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.,The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you,and try and -- I want to get more on this,that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful. 
 CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,,and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.,Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. 
 (Applause)I am sorry I cannot show you my face,,because if I do, the bad guys will come for me. 
 My journey started 14 years ago.,I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college. 
 Then I got a scoop.,The scoop was quite a very simple story.,Police officers were taking bribes,from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.,As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it,in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,,since everybody knew that it was happening,,and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system. 
 So I decided to go there,and act as a seller.,As part of selling, I was able to document,the hard core evidence.,The impact was great.,It was fantastic. 
 This was what many call immersion journalism,,or undercover journalism.,I am an undercover journalist.,My journalism is hinged on three basic principles:,naming, shaming and jailing.,Journalism is about results.,It's about affecting your community or your society,in the most progressive way.,I have worked on this for over 14 years,,and I can tell you, the results are very good. 
 One story that comes to mind,in my undercover pieces,is "Spirit Child.",It was about children who were born with deformities,,and their parents felt that once they were born,with those deformities,,they were not good enough to live in the society,,so they were given some concoction to take,and as a result they died.,So I built a prosthetic baby,,and I went into the village,,pretended as though this baby had been born,with a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.,They got themselves ready.,In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,,and they came that fateful morning,to come and kill the child.,I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.,They put it on fire. It was boiling hot,,getting ready to give to the kids.,Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,,they were on standby,,and just as the concoction was ready,,and they were about to give it to the kids,,I phoned the police,,and fortunately they came and busted them.,As I speak now, they are before the courts.,Don't forget the key principles:,naming, shaming and jailing.,The court process is taking place,,and I'm very sure at the end of the day,we will find them, and we will put them,where they belong too. 
 Another key story that comes to mind,,which relates to this spirit child phenomenon,,is "The Spell of the Albinos.",I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,,children who are born with albinism,are sometimes considered as being unfit,to live in society.,Their bodies are chopped up with machetes,and are supposed to be used for some concoctions,or some potions for people to get money --,or so many, many stories people would tell about it.,It was time to go undercover again.,So I went undercover as a man who was interested,in this particular business, of course.,Again, a prosthetic arm was built.,For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera,the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm,and they were ready to use it to prepare,those potions for people. 
 I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,,but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government,could only take action because the evidence was available.,My journalism is about hard core evidence.,If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence,that you have stolen.,I show you how you stole it,and when, or what you used,what you had stolen to do.,What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society? 
 My kind of journalism is a product,of my society.,I know that sometimes,people have their own criticisms,about undercover journalism. 
 (Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets,and put it on the table,,so that we should not be afraid.,He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.,So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.,I didn't utter a word.,But my colleagues didn't know.,So after collecting the money,,when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.,Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that,since I was the leader of the group,,I told my colleagues that if they come,,we will arrest them. 
 Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].,I've never stepped there before.,So I'm surprised.,You see a hand counting money just in front of me.,The next moment, you see the money in my hands,,counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.,I have not done any business with anybody.,Reporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter 
 Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,,he just smiled and gave this video extract,he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.,The officer who earlier denied involvement,pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money,they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled. 
 Anas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.,And here was him, denying.,But you see, when you have the hard core evidence,,you are able to affect society.,Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

 [Prez. Mills Storms Tema Harbour Over Anas Video],["Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills: Former president of Ghana"] 
 John Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says,is not something which is unknown to many of us,,but please, those of you who are agents,,and who are leading the customs officers into temptation,,I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say,any good things to you about this. 
 AAA: That was my president. 
 I thought that I couldn't come here,without giving you something special.,I have a piece, and I'm excited that,I'm sharing it for the first time with you here.,I have been undercover in the prisons.,I have been there for a long time.,And I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.,But again, I can only affect society,and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.,Many times, the prison authorities have denied,ever having issues of drug abuse,,issues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny,that it ever happens.,How can you obtain the hard core evidence? 
 So I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"],Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.,Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,,one of my friends, from his sick bed till death,,and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.,There were issues of bad food being served,as I recall that some of the food I ate,is just not good for a human being.,Toilet facilities: very bad.,I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend --,and that's what I call proper,,when four of us are on a manhole.,It is something that if you narrate it to somebody,,the person wouldn't believe it.,The only way that you can let the person believe,is when you show hard core evidence.,Of course, drugs were abundant.,It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,,faster even, in the prison than outside the prison. 
 Evil in the society is an extreme disease.,If you have extreme diseases,,you need to get extreme remedies.,My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents,or other countries,,but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent,of Africa, because usually, when people talk,about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?,Show me the evidence.",I say, "This is the evidence.",And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars. 
 You see, we on the continent are able,to tell the story better because we face the conditions,and we see the conditions.,That is why I was particularly excited,when we launched our "Africa Investigates" series,where we investigated a lot of African countries.,As a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,,we are moving on to World Investigates.,By the end of it, a lot more bad guys,on our continent will be put behind bars. 
 This will not stop.,I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,,because I know that when evil men destroy,,good men must build and bind. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.,I have some questions for you.,How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah? 
 AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about,setting the priorities right, so we got people,to take me to court.,So I went through the very legal process,,because at the end of the day, the prison authorities,want to check whether indeed you have been there or not,,and that's how I got in there. 
 CA: So someone sued you in court,,and they took you there, and you were in remand custody,for part of it, and you did that deliberately. 
 AAA: Yes, yes. 
 CA: Talk to me just about fear,and how you manage that,,because you're regularly putting your life at risk.,How do you do that? 
 AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.,Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.,And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear,whenever I am sure that all the steps,have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team,who help ensure that the safety and all the systems,are put in place, but you've got to take,very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.,If you don't, you will end up losing your life.,So yes, when the backup systems are put in place,,I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,,but it's a hazard of a profession.,I mean, everybody has their hazard.,And once you say that is yours,,you've got to take it, as and when it comes. 
 CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work,and you've taught us a story,like no story I think any of us have heard before.,And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas. 
 AAA: Thank you. 
 CA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)The writer George Eliot cautioned us that,,among all forms of mistake,,prophesy is the most gratuitous.,The person that we would all acknowledge,as her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed.,He said, "It's tough to make predictions,,especially about the future." 
 I'm going to ignore their cautions,and make one very specific forecast.,In the world that we are creating very quickly,,we're going to see more and more things,that look like science fiction,,and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs.,Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves,,which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers.,We're going to hook Siri up to Watson,and use that to automate a lot of the work,that's currently done by customer service reps,and troubleshooters and diagnosers,,and we're already taking R2D2,,painting him orange, and putting him to work,carrying shelves around warehouses,,which means we need a lot fewer people,to be walking up and down those aisles. 
 Now, for about 200 years,,people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you --,the age of technological unemployment is at hand —,starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain,just about two centuries ago,,and they have been wrong.,Our economies in the developed world have coasted along,on something pretty close to full employment. 
 Which brings up a critical question:,Why is this time different, if it really is?,The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years,,our machines have started demonstrating skills,they have never, ever had before:,understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing,,answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills.,For example, mobile humanoid robots,are still incredibly primitive,,but the research arm of the Defense Department,just launched a competition,to have them do things like this,,and if the track record is any guide,,this competition is going to be successful.,So when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all,when we're going to have androids,doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now.,And we're creating a world where there is going to be,more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs.,It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling,"the new machine age." 
 The thing to keep in mind is that,this is absolutely great news.,This is the best economic news on the planet these days.,Not that there's a lot of competition, right?,This is the best economic news we have these days,for two main reasons.,The first is, technological progress is what allows us,to continue this amazing recent run that we're on,where output goes up over time,,while at the same time, prices go down,,and volume and quality just continue to explode.,Now, some people look at this and talk about,shallow materialism,,but that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it.,This is abundance, which is exactly,what we want our economic system to provide.,The second reason that the new machine age,is such great news is that, once the androids,start doing jobs, we don't have to do them anymore,,and we get freed up from drudgery and toil. 
 Now, when I talk about this with my friends,in Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say,,"Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil.,This gives us the chance to imagine,an entirely different kind of society,,a society where the creators and the discoverers,and the performers and the innovators,come together with their patrons and their financiers,to talk about issues, entertain, enlighten,,provoke each other.",It's a society really, that looks a lot like the TED Conference.,And there's actually a huge amount of truth here.,We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place.,In a world where it is just about as easy,to generate an object as it is to print a document,,we have amazing new possibilities.,The people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists,are now makers, and they're responsible,for massive amounts of innovation.,And artists who were formerly constrained,can now do things that were never, ever possible,for them before.,So this is a time of great flourishing,,and the more I look around, the more convinced I become,that this quote, from the physicist Freeman Dyson,,is not hyperbole at all.,This is just a plain statement of the facts.,We are in the middle of an astonishing period. 
 ["Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences." — Freeman Dyson] 
 Which brings up another great question:,What could possibly go wrong in this new machine age?,Right? Great, hang up, flourish, go home.,We're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges,as we head deeper into the future that we're creating. 
 The first are economic, and they're really nicely summarized,in an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth,between Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther,,who was the head of the auto workers union.,They were touring one of the new modern factories,,and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says,,"Hey Walter, how are you going to get these robots,to pay union dues?",And Reuther shoots back, "Hey Henry,,how are you going to get them to buy cars?" 
 Reuther's problem in that anecdote,is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy,that's full of machines,,and we see this very clearly in the statistics.,If you look over the past couple decades,at the returns to capital -- in other words, corporate profits --,we see them going up,,and we see that they're now at an all-time high.,If we look at the returns to labor, in other words,total wages paid out in the economy,,we see them at an all-time low,and heading very quickly in the opposite direction. 
 So this is clearly bad news for Reuther.,It looks like it might be great news for Ford,,but it's actually not. If you want to sell,huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people,,you really want a large, stable, prosperous middle class.,We have had one of those in America,for just about the entire postwar period.,But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now.,We all know a lot of the statistics,,but just to repeat one of them,,median income in America has actually gone down,over the past 15 years,,and we're in danger of getting trapped,in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization,continue to go up over time. 
 The societal challenges that come along,with that kind of inequality deserve some attention.,There are a set of societal challenges,that I'm actually not that worried about,,and they're captured by images like this.,This is not the kind of societal problem,that I am concerned about.,There is no shortage of dystopian visions,about what happens when our machines become self-aware,,and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us.,I'm going to start worrying about those,the day my computer becomes aware of my printer. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about.,To tell you the kinds of societal challenges,that are going to come up in the new machine age,,I want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers.,And to make them really stereotypical,,let's make them both white guys.,And the first one is a college-educated,professional, creative type, manager,,engineer, doctor, lawyer, that kind of worker.,We're going to call him "Ted.",He's at the top of the American middle class.,His counterpart is not college-educated,and works as a laborer, works as a clerk,,does low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy.,We're going to call that guy "Bill." 
 And if you go back about 50 years,,Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives.,For example, in 1960 they were both very likely,to have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week.,But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented,,as we started to automate the economy,,and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses,,as we started to progressively inject technology,and automation and digital stuff into the economy,,the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot.,Over this time frame, Ted has continued,to hold a full-time job. Bill hasn't.,In many cases, Bill has left the economy entirely,,and Ted very rarely has.,Over time, Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy.,Bill's hasn't.,And Ted's kids have grown up in a two-parent home,,while Bill's absolutely have not over time.,Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society?,He's decreased his voting in presidential elections,,and he's started to go to prison a lot more often.,So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends,,and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves.,They're also true no matter which ethnic group,or demographic group we look at,,and they're actually getting so severe,that they're in danger of overwhelming,even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement. 
 And what my friends in Silicon Valley,and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.,They're living these amazingly busy, productive lives,,and they've got all the benefits to show from that,,while Bill is leading a very different life.,They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was,when he talked about the benefits of work,,and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils. 
 ["Work saves a man from three great evils: boredom, vice and need." — Voltaire] 
 So with these challenges, what do we do about them? 
 The economic playbook is surprisingly clear,,surprisingly straightforward, in the short term especially.,The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two,,so the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine:,Encourage entrepreneurship,,double down on infrastructure,,and make sure we're turning out people,from our educational system with the appropriate skills. 
 But over the longer term, if we are moving into an economy,that's heavy on technology and light on labor,,and we are, then we have to consider,some more radical interventions,,for example, something like a guaranteed minimum income.,Now, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable,,because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing,and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth.,I did a little bit of research on this notion,,and it might calm some folk down to know that,the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income,has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists,Friedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman.,And if you find yourself worried,that something like a guaranteed income,is going to stifle our drive to succeed,and make us kind of complacent,,you might be interested to know that social mobility,,one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States,,is now lower than it is in the northern European countries,that have these very generous social safety nets.,So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward. 
 The societal one is a lot more challenging.,I don't know what the playbook is,for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life. 
 I do know that education is a huge part of it.,I witnessed this firsthand.,I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education,,and what that education taught me,is that the world is an interesting place,and my job is to go explore it.,The school stopped in third grade,,so then I entered the public school system,,and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag.,With the benefit of hindsight, I now know the job,was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer,,but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of,bore me into some submission with what was going on around me.,We have to do better than this.,We cannot keep turning out Bills. 
 So we see some green shoots that things are getting better.,We see technology deeply impacting education,and engaging people, from our youngest learners,up to our oldest ones.,We see very prominent business voices telling us,we need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while.,And we see very serious and sustained,and data-driven efforts to understand,how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have. 
 So the green shoots are out there.,I don't want to pretend for a minute,that what we have is going to be enough.,We're facing very tough challenges.,To give just one example, there are about five million Americans,who have been unemployed for at least six months.,We're not going to fix things for them,by sending them back to Montessori.,And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world,where we're going to have glittering technologies,embedded in kind of a shabby society,and supported by an economy that generates inequality,instead of opportunity. 
 But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do.,I think we're going to do something a lot better,for one very straightforward reason:,The facts are getting out there.,The realities of this new machine age,and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known.,If we wanted to accelerate that process, we could do things,like have our best economists and policymakers,play "Jeopardy!" against Watson.,We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip.,And if we do enough of these kinds of things,,the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different.,And then we're off to the races,,because I don't believe for a second,that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges,or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try. 
 I started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths,who were separated by an ocean and a century.,Let me end it with words from politicians,who were similarly distant. 
 Winston Churchill came to my home of MIT in 1949,,and he said, "If we are to bring the broad masses,of the people in every land to the table of abundance,,it can only be by the tireless improvement,of all of our means of technical production." 
 Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient.,He said, "I am a firm believer in the people.,If given the truth, they can be depended upon,to meet any national crisis.,The great point is to give them the plain facts." 
 So the optimistic note, great point that I want to leave you with,is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear,,and I have every confidence that we're going to use them,to chart a good course into the challenging,,abundant economy that we're creating. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Everything is interconnected.,As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.,We are a small fishing tribe,situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island,near the town of Southampton in New York. 
 When I was a little girl,,my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.,There were no clouds in the sky.,And after a while I began to perspire.,And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,,"Look, do you see that?,That's part of you up there.,That's your water that helps to make the cloud,that becomes the rain that feeds the plants,that feeds the animals." 
 In my continued exploration of subjects in nature,that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,,I started storm chasing in 2008,after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that." 
 And so three days later, driving very fast,,I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,,capable of producing grapefruit-size hail,and spectacular tornadoes,,although only two percent actually do.,These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide,and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.,They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,,making it very dark and ominous standing under them. 
 Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.,There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back,and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.,And then there are the colors in the clouds,of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.,I've learned to respect the lightning.,My hair used to be straight. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm just kidding. 
 (Laughter) 
 What really excites me about these storms,is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,,with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.,They become lovely monsters. 
 When I'm photographing them,,I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.,As I stand under them,,I see not just a cloud,,but understand that what I have the privilege to witness,is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version,that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun,and even this very planet. 
 All my relations. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to go off script,and make Chris quite nervous here,by making this audience participation.,All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right. 
 So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand,if you've ever heard anheterosexual couple having sex.,Could be the neighbors, hotel room,,your parents. Sorry.,Okay. Pretty much everybody.,Now raise your hand if the man was making,more noise than the woman.,I see one guy there.,It doesn't count if it was you, sir.,(Laughter),So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.,Sitting next to a loud guy. 
 Now what does this tell us?,It tells us that human beings,make noise when they have sex,,and it's generally the woman who makes more noise.,This is known as female copulatory vocalization,to the clipboard crowd.,I wasn't even going to mention this,,but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,,and she is the world's most famous,female copulatory vocalizer.,So I thought, got to talk about that.,We'll get back to that a little bit later. 
 Let me start by saying human beings,are not descended from apes,,despite what you may have heard. We are apes.,We are more closely relatednto the chimp and the bonobo,than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,,as Jared Diamond pointednout in one of his early books.,We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos,than chimps and bonobos are related,to any other primate --,gorillas, orangutans, what have you.,So we're extremely closely related to them,,and as you'll see in terms of our behavior,,we've got some relationship as well.,So what I'm asking today, the question,I want to explore with you today is,,what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?,Now, since Darwin's day there's been,what Cacilda and I have called,the standard narrative of human sexual evolution,,and you're all familiar with it,,even if you haven't read this stuff.,The idea is that, as part of human nature,,from the beginning of our species' time,,men have sort of leasednwomen's reproductive potential,by providing them with certain goods and services.,Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,,protection, things like that.,And in exchange, women have offered fidelity,,or at least a promise of fidelity.,Now this sets men and women upnin an oppositional relationship.,The war between the sexes is built right intonour DNA, according to this vision. Right?,What Cacilda and I have argued is that no,,this economic relationship,,this oppositional relationship,,is actually an artifact of agriculture,,which only arose about 10,000nyears ago at the earliest.,Anatomically modern human beings,have been around for about 200,000 years,,so we're talking about five percent, at most,,of our time as a modern, distinct species.,So before agriculture,,before the agricultural revolution,,it's important to understand that human beings,lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are,characterized wherever they're found in the world,by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.,They not only share things,,they demand that things be shared:,meat, shelter, protection, all these things,that were supposedly being traded to women,for their sexual fidelity, it turns out,,are shared widely among these societies.,Now I'm not saying that our ancestors,were noble savages, and I'm not saying,modern day hunter-gatherersnare noble savages either.,What I'm saying is that this is simply,the best way to mitigate risk,in a foraging context.,And there's really no argumentnabout this among anthropologists.,All Cacilda and I have done is extendnthis sharing behavior to sexuality.,So we've argued that human sexuality,has essentially evolved, until agriculture,,as a way of establishing and maintaining,the complex, flexible social systems, networks,,that our ancestors were very good at,,and that's why our species has survived so well. 
 Now, this makes some people uncomfortable,,and so I always need to take na moment in these talks,to say, listen,,I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,,but I'm not saying they werenhaving sex with strangers.,There were no strangers. Right?,In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.,You've known these people your entire life.,So I'm saying, yes, there werenoverlapping sexual relationships,,that our ancestors probably hadnseveral different sexual relationships,going on at any given moment in their adult lives.,But I'm not saying they werenhaving sex with strangers.,I'm not saying that they didn't love thenpeople they were having sex with.,And I'm not saying there wasnno pair-bonding going on.,I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. 
 And those of us who havenchosen to be monogamous --,my parents, for example, have been married,for 52 years monogamously,,and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,,I don't want to hear about it—,I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying,there's anything wrong with this.,What I'm saying is that to argue,that our ancestors were sexual omnivores,is no more a criticism of monogamy,than to argue that our ancestorsnwere dietary omnivores,is a criticism of vegetarianism.,You can choose to be a vegetarian,,but don't think that just becausenyou've made that decision,,bacon suddenly stops smelling good.,Okay? So this is my point.,(Laughter),That one took a minute to sink in, huh? 
 Now, in addition to being a great genius,,a wonderful man, a wonderful husband,,a wonderful father, Charles Darwin,was also a world-class Victorian prude.,All right? He was perplexed,by the sexual swellings of certain primates,,including chimps and bonobos,,because these sexual swellings tend to provoke,many males to mate with the females.,So he couldn't understand why on Earth wouldnthe female have developed this thing,if all they were supposed to be doingnis forming their pair bond, right?,Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,,but chimps and bonobos mate,one to four times per hour,with up to a dozen males per day,when they have their sexual swellings.,Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings,through 40 percent, roughly,,of their menstrual cycle,,bonobos 90 percent,,and humans are among thenonly species on the planet,where the female is available for sex,throughout the menstrual cycle,,whether she's menstruating,nwhether she's post-menopausal,,whether she's already pregnant.,This is vanishingly rare among mammals.,So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.,Now, Darwin ignored the reflections,of the sexual swelling in his own day,,as scientists tend to do sometimes. 
 So what we're talking about is sperm competition.,Now the average human ejaculatenhas about 300 million sperm cells,,so it's already a competitive environment.,The question is whether these sperm are ncompeting against other men's sperm,or just their own.,There's a lot to talk about in this chart.,The one thing I'll call your attention to right away,is the little musical note above thenfemale chimp and bonobo and human.,That indicates female copulatory vocalization.,Just look at the numbers.,The average human has sex,about 1,000 times per birth.,If that number seems high for some of you,,I assure you it seems low for others in the room.,We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.,We don't share it with the other three apes,,the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,,who are more typical of mammals,,having sex only about a dozen times per birth.,Humans and bonobos are the only nanimals that have sex face-to-face,when both of them are alive.,(Laughter),And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo,all have external testicles, which in our book,we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage,just for beer.,If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge,in the garage, you expect a party to happen,at any moment, and you need to be ready.,That's what the external testicles are.,They keep the sperm cells cool,so you can have frequent ejaculations.,I'm sorry. It's true.,The human, some of you will be happy to hear,,has the largest, thickest penis of any primate. 
 Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.,It goes into anthropology as well.,Historical records are full of accounts of people,around the world who have sexual practices,that should be impossible,given what we have assumednabout human sexual evolution.,These women are the Mosuonfrom southwestern China.,In their society, everyone, men and women,,are completely sexually autonomous.,There's no shame associated with sexual behavior.,Women have hundreds of partners.,It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.nNobody gossips. It's not an issue.,When the woman becomes pregnant,,the child is cared for by her, nher sisters, and her brothers.,The biological father is a nonissue.,On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,,we've got many tribes which practice,what anthropologists call partible paternity.,These people actually believe --,and they have no contact among them,,no common language or anything,,so it's not an idea that spread,,it's an idea that's arisen around the world --,they believe that a fetus is literally made,of accumulated semen.,So a woman who wants to have a child,who's smart and funny and strong,makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,,the funny guy and the strong guy,,to get the essence of each ofnthese men into the baby,,and then when the child is born,,these different men will come forward,and acknowledge their paternity of the child.,So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor,in this society.,So there are all sorts of examples like this,that we go through in the book. 
 Now, why does this matter?,Edward Wilson says we need to understand,that human sexuality is first a bonding device,and only secondarily procreation.,I think that's true. This matters because,our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict,with many aspects of the modern world.,The contradictions between what we're told,we should feel and what we actually do feel,generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.,My hope is that a more accurate,,updated understanding of human sexuality,will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,,for each other,,greater respect for unconventionalnrelationship configurations,like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,,and that we'll finally put to rest the idea,that men have some innate, instinctive right,to monitor and control women's sexual behavior.,(Applause),Thank you.,And we'll see that it's not only gay people,that have to come out of the closet.,We all have closets we have to come out of. Right?,And when we do come out of those closets,,we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,,our fight is with an outdated, nVictorian sense of human sexuality,that conflates desire with property rights,,generates shame and confusion,in place of understanding and empathy.,It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,,because the truth is,that men are from Africa,and women are from Africa. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you.nChristopher Ryan: Thank you. 
 CA: So a question.,It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments,about evolutionary history,to turn that into what we ought to do today.,Someone could give a talk and say,,look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth,and muscles and a brain that's really good,at throwing weapons,,and if you look at lots of societies around the world,,you'll see very high rates of violence.,Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,,but it's not who you are.,How is that different,from the talk you gave? 
 CR: Well first of all, the evidence,for high levels of violence in prehistory,is very debatable.,But that's just an example.,Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me,,just because we lived a certain way in the past,doesn't mean we should live that nway now, and I agree with that.,Everyone has to respond to the modern world.,But the body does have its inherent,evolved trajectories.,And so you could live onnMcDonald's and milkshakes,,but your body will rebel against nthat. We have appetites.,I think it was Schopenhauer who said,,a person can do what they want,but not want what they want.,And so what I'm arguing against,is the shame that's associated with desires.,It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife,but you still are attracted to other people,,there's something wrong with you,,there's something wrong with your marriage,,something wrong with your partner.,I think a lot of families are fractured,by unrealistic expectations,that are based upon this falsenvision of human sexuality.,That's what I'm trying to get at. 
 CA: Thank you. Communicatednpowerfully. Thanks a lot. 
 CR: Thank you, Chris.n(Applause)It is said that the grass is always greener,on the other side of the fence,,and I believe this is true,,especially when I hear President Obama,often talk about the Korean education system,as a benchmark of success.,Well, I can tell you that,,in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature,of the Korean school system,,also known as pressure cooker,,not everyone can do well in that environment.,While many people responded in different ways,about our education system,,my response to the high-pressure environment,was making bows with pieces of wood,found near my apartment building. 
 Why bows?,I'm not quite sure.,Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure,,my caveman instinct of survival,has connected with the bows.,If you think about it,,the bow has really helped drive human survival,since prehistoric times.,The area within three kilometers of my home,used to be a mulberry forest,during the Joseon dynasty,,where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.,In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,,the government has planted mulberry trees.,The seeds from these trees,also have spread by birds here and there,nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway,that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.,The area near these walls,,which nobody bothers to pay attention to,,had been left free from major intervention,,and this is where I first found my treasures. 
 As I fell deeper into bow making,,I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.,When I went on school field trips,,family vacations, or simply on my way home,from extracurricular classes,,I wandered around wooded areas,and gathered tree branches,with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.,And they would be somethings like saws, knives,,sickles and axes,that I covered up with a piece of towel.,I would bring the branches home,,riding buses and subways,,barely holding them in my hands. 
 And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.,Airport security. 
 (Laughter),In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,,I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long,until a bow took shape. 
 One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece,and ended up setting the place on fire.,Where? The rooftop of my apartment building,,a place where 96 families call home.,A customer from a department store across from my building,called 911,,and I ran downstairs to tell my mom,with half of my hair burned.,I want to take this opportunity,to tell my mom, in the audience today:,Mom, I was really sorry,,and I will be more careful with open fire from now on. 
 My mother had to do a lot of explaining,,telling people that her son did not commit,a premeditated arson. 
 I also researched extensively on bows around the world.,In that process, I tried to combine,the different bows from across time and places,to create the most effective bow.,I also worked with many different types of wood,,such as maple, yew and mulberry,,and did many shooting experiments,in the wooded area near the urban expressway,that I mentioned before. 
 The most effective bow for me,would be like this. 
 One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness,when you draw and shoot the arrow. 
 Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,,which means more power. 
 Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb,for maximum tension storage. 
 And four: Horn used to store energy in compression. 
 After fixing, breaking, redesigning,,mending, bending and amending,,my ideal bow began to take shape,,and when it was finally done,,it looked like this.,I was so proud of myself,for inventing a perfect bow on my own.,This is a picture of Korean traditional bows,taken from a museum,,and see how my bow resembles them.,Thanks to my ancestors,for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter) 
 Through bowmaking,,I came in contact with part of my heritage.,Learning the information that has accumulated over time,and reading the message left by my ancestors,were better than any consolation therapy,or piece of advice any living adults could give me.,You see, I searched far and wide,,but never bothered to look close and near.,From this realization,,I began to take interest in Korean history,,which had never inspired me before.,In the end, the grass is often greener,on my side of the fence,,although we don't realize it. 
 Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.,And let's see how this one works.,This is a bamboo bow,,with 45-pound draw weights.,(Noise of shooting arrow),(Applause) 
 A bow may function in a simple mechanism,,but in order to make a good bow,,a great amount of sensitivity is required.,You need to console and communicate,with the wood material.,Each fiber in the wood,has its own reason and function for being,,and only through cooperation and harmony among them,comes a great bow.,I may be an [odd] student,with unconventional interests,,but I hope I am making a contribution,by sharing my story with all of you. 
 My ideal world is a place,where no one is left behind,,where everyone is needed exactly where they are,,like the fibers and the tendons in a bow,,a place where the strong is flexible,and the vulnerable is resilient.,The bow resembles me,,and I resemble the bow.,Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.,No, better yet, a part of my mind,has just been shot over to your mind.,Did it strike you? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The day I left home for the first time,to go to university was a bright day,brimming with hope and optimism.,I'd done well at school.nExpectations for me were high,,and I gleefully entered the student life,of lectures, partiesnand traffic cone theft.,Now appearances, of course,ncan be deceptive,,and to an extent, thisnfeisty, energetic persona,of lecture-going and trafficncone stealing was a veneer,,albeit a very well-craftednand convincing one.,Underneath, I was actuallyndeeply unhappy, insecure,and fundamentally frightened --,frightened of other people,nof the future, of failure,and of the emptinessnthat I felt was within me.,But I was skilled at hidingnit, and from the outside,appeared to be someonenwith everything to hope for,and aspire to.,This fantasy of invulnerabilitynwas so complete,that I even deceived myself,,and as the first semesternended and the second began,,there was no way that anyonencould have predicted,what was just about to happen.,I was leaving a seminar when it started,,humming to myself, fumbling with my bag,just as I'd done a hundred times before,,when suddenly I heardna voice calmly observe,,"She is leaving the room.",I looked around, and therenwas no one there,,but the claritynand decisiveness of the comment,was unmistakable.,Shaken, I left my booksnon the stairs and hurried home,,and there it was again.,"She is opening the door.",This was the beginning.nThe voice had arrived.,And the voice persisted,,days and then weeks of it, on and on,,narrating everything I didnin the third person.,"She is going to the library.","She is going to a lecture.",It was neutral, impassivenand even, after a while,,strangely companionate and reassuring,,although I did notice that itsncalm exterior sometimes slipped,and that it occasionally mirrorednmy own unexpressed emotion.,So, for example, if I was angrynand had to hide it,,which I often did, being very adeptnat concealing how I really felt,,then the voice would sound frustrated.,Otherwise, it was neithernsinister nor disturbing,,although even at that point it was clear,that it had something to communicate to me,about my emotions, particularly emotions,which were remote and inaccessible.,Now it was then that I madena fatal mistake,,in that I told a friendnabout the voice, and she was horrified.,A subtle conditioning process had begun,,the implication that normalnpeople don't hear voices,and the fact that I did meantnthat something was very seriously wrong.,Such fear and mistrust was infectious.,Suddenly the voice didn'tnseem quite so benign anymore,,and when she insistednthat I seek medical attention,,I duly complied, and which proved to be,mistake number two.,I spent some time telling the college G.P.,about what I perceivednto be the real problem:,anxiety, low self-worth,nfears about the future,,and was met with bored indifference,until I mentioned the voice,,upon which he dropped his pen, swung round,and began to question menwith a show of real interest.,And to be fair, I was desperatenfor interest and help,,and I began to tell himnabout my strange commentator.,And I always wish, at thisnpoint, the voice had said,,"She is digging her own grave.",I was referrednto a psychiatrist, who likewise,took a grim view of the voice's presence,,subsequently interpretingneverything I said,through a lens of latent insanity.,For example, I was partnof a student TV station,that broadcast news bulletinsnaround the campus,,and during an appointmentnwhich was running very late,,I said, "I'm sorry,ndoctor, I've got to go.,I'm reading the news at six.",Now it's down on my medicalnrecords that Eleanor,has delusions that she's a televisionnnews broadcaster.,It was at this point that events began,to rapidly overtake me.,A hospital admissionnfollowed, the first of many,,a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,,and then, worst of all,na toxic, tormenting sense,of hopelessness, humiliation and despair,about myself and my prospects.,But having been encouragednto see the voice,not as an experience but as a symptom,,my fear and resistancentowards it intensified.,Now essentially, this represented taking,an aggressive stance towards my own mind,,a kind of psychic civil war,,and in turn this causednthe number of voices to increase,and grow progressivelynhostile and menacing.,Helplessly and hopelessly,nI began to retreat,into this nightmarish inner world,in which the voicesnwere destined to become,both my persecutorsnand my only perceived companions.,They told me, for example,nthat if I proved myself worthy,of their help, thennthey could change my life,back to how it had been,,and a series of increasinglynbizarre tasks was set,,a kind of labor of Hercules.,It started off quite small, for example,,pull out three strands of hair,,but gradually it grew more extreme,,culminating in commands to harm myself,,and a particularly dramatic instruction:,"You see that tutor over there?,You see that glass of water?,Well, you have to go over and pour itnover him in front of the other students.",Which I actually did,nand which needless to say,did not endear me to the faculty.,In effect, a vicious cyclenof fear, avoidance,,mistrust and misunderstandingnhad been established,,and this was a battlenin which I felt powerless,and incapable of establishingnany kind of peace or reconciliation.,Two years later,nand the deterioration was dramatic.,By now, I had the wholenfrenzied repertoire:,terrifying voices, grotesque visions,,bizarre, intractable delusions.,My mental health statusnhad been a catalyst,for discrimination, verbal abuse,,and physical and sexual assault,,and I'd been told by my psychiatrist,,"Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,,because cancer is easiernto cure than schizophrenia.",I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,,and was by now so tormented by the voices,that I attempted to drillna hole in my head,in order to get them out.,Now looking back on the wreckagenand despair of those years,,it seems to me now as if someonendied in that place,,and yet, someone else was saved.,A broken and hauntednperson began that journey,,but the person who emerged was a survivor,and would ultimately grow into the person,I was destined to be.,Many people have harmed me in my life,,and I remember them all,,but the memories grow pale and faint,in comparison with the peoplenwho've helped me.,The fellow survivors,nthe fellow voice-hearers,,the comrades and collaborators;,the mother who never gave up on me,,who knew that one daynI would come back to her,and was willing to wait for menfor as long as it took;,the doctor who only workednwith me for a brief time,but who reinforcednhis belief that recovery,was not only possible but inevitable,,and during a devastating period of relapse,told my terrified family,n"Don't give up hope.,I believe that Eleanorncan get through this.,Sometimes, you know, itnsnows as late as May,,but summer always comes eventually.",Fourteen minutes is not enough time,to fully credit thosengood and generous people,who fought with me and for me,and who waited to welcome me back,from that agonized, lonely place.,But together, they forgedna blend of courage,,creativity, integrity,nand an unshakeable belief,that my shattered self couldnbecome healed and whole.,I used to say that these people saved me,,but what I now know is they did something,even more importantnin that they empowered me,to save myself,,and crucially, they helpednme to understand something,which I'd always suspected:,that my voices were a meaningful response,to traumatic life events,nparticularly childhood events,,and as such were not my enemies,but a source of insightninto solvable emotional problems.,Now, at first, this was veryndifficult to believe,,not least because the voicesnappeared so hostile,and menacing, so in thisnrespect, a vital first step,was learning to separatenout a metaphorical meaning,from what I'd previouslyninterpreted to be a literal truth.,So for example, voicesnwhich threatened to attack my home,I learned to interpretnas my own sense of fear,and insecurity in the world, rathernthan an actual, objective danger.,Now at first, I would have believed them.,I remember, for example,nsitting up one night,on guard outside my parents'nroom to protect them,from what I thought was a genuinenthreat from the voices.,Because I'd had such a badnproblem with self-injury,that most of the cutlerynin the house had been hidden,,so I ended up arming myselfnwith a plastic fork,,kind of like picnic ware,nand sort of sat outside the room,clutching it and waiting to springninto action should anything happen.,It was like, "Don't mess with me.,I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?",Strategic.,But a later response,nand much more useful,,would be to try and deconstructnthe message behind the words,,so when the voices warnednme not to leave the house,,then I would thank themnfor drawing my attention,to how unsafe I felt --,because if I was aware of it, then I couldndo something positive about it --,but go on to reassure both them and myself,that we were safe and didn'tnneed to feel frightened anymore.,I would set boundaries for the voices,,and try to interact with themnin a way that was assertive,yet respectful,nestablishing a slow process,of communication and collaboration,in which we could learn to workntogether and support one another.,Throughout all of this,nwhat I would ultimately realize,was that each voice was closely related,to aspects of myself,nand that each of them,carried overwhelmingnemotions that I'd never had,an opportunity to process or resolve,,memories of sexual trauma and abuse,,of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.,The voices took the place of this pain,and gave words to it,,and possibly one of the greatestnrevelations,was when I realized that the most hostilenand aggressive voices,actually represented the parts of me,that had been hurt most profoundly,,and as such, it was these voices,that needed to be shownnthe greatest compassion and care.,It was armed with thisnknowledge that ultimately,I would gather together my shattered self,,each fragment representednby a different voice,,gradually withdraw from all my medication,,and return to psychiatry, only thisntime from the other side.,Ten years after the voice firstncame, I finally graduated,,this time with the highestndegree in psychology,the university had everngiven, and one year later,,the highest masters, which shall we say,isn't bad for a madwoman.,In fact, one of the voicesnactually dictated the answers,during the exam, which technicallynpossibly counts as cheating.,(Laughter),And to be honest, sometimes I quitenenjoyed their attention as well.,As Oscar Wilde has said,nthe only thing worse,than being talked about is notnbeing talked about.,It also makes you veryngood at eavesdropping,,because you can listennto two conversations simultaneously.,So it's not all bad.,I worked in mental health services,,I spoke at conferences,,I published book chaptersnand academic articles,,and I argued, and continue to do so,,the relevance of the following concept:,that an important question in psychiatry,shouldn't be what's wrong with you,but rather what's happened to you.,And all the while,nI listened to my voices,,with whom I'd finally learnednto live with peace and respect,and which in turnnreflected a growing sense,of compassion, acceptancenand respect towards myself.,And I remember the most movingnand extraordinary moment,when supporting another young womannwho was terrorized by her voices,,and becoming fully aware,nfor the very first time,,that I no longer felt that way myself,but was finally able to helpnsomeone else who was.,I'm now very proud to bena part of Intervoice,,the organizational body of the InternationalnHearing Voices Movement,,an initiative inspired by the worknof Professor Marius Romme,and Dr. Sandra Escher,,which locates voice hearingnas a survival strategy,,a sane reaction to insane circumstances,,not as an aberrant symptomnof schizophrenia to be endured,,but a complex, significantnand meaningful experience,to be explored.,Together, we envisage and enact a society,that understandsnand respects voice hearing,,supports the needsnof individuals who hear voices,,and which values them as full citizens.,This type of society is not only possible,,it's already on its way.,To paraphrase Chavez, oncensocial change begins,,it cannot be reversed.,You cannot humiliatenthe person who feels pride.,You cannot oppress the people,who are not afraid anymore.,For me, the achievementsnof the Hearing Voices Movement,are a reminder that empathy, fellowship,,justice and respect are more than words;,they are convictions and beliefs,,and that beliefs can change the world.,In the last 20 years,nthe Hearing Voices Movement,has established hearing voices networks,in 26 countries across five continents,,working together to promotendignity, solidarity,and empowerment for individualsnin mental distress,,to create a new languagenand practice of hope,,which, at its very center,nlies an unshakable belief,in the power of the individual.,As Peter Levine has said, the human animal,is a unique being,endowed with an instinctualncapacity to heal,and the intellectual spiritnto harness this innate capacity.,In this respect, for members of society,,there is no greater honor or privilege,than facilitating that processnof healing for someone,,to bear witness, to reach out a hand,,to share the burdennof someone's suffering,,and to hold the hope for their recovery.,And likewise, for survivorsnof distress and adversity,,that we remember we don'tnhave to live our lives,forever defined by the damagingnthings that have happened to us.,We are unique. We are irreplaceable.,What lies within us cannnever be truly colonized,,contorted, or taken away.,The light never goes out.,As a very wonderfulndoctor once said to me,,"Don't tell me what other peoplenhave told you about yourself.,Tell me about you.",Thank you.,(Applause)Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream,would persuade you to think of trying,to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car? 
 Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.,I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely,to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?,I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport,and sustainable energy production.,That sort of overall sustainable energy problem,is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,,independent of environmental concerns.,In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,,given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,,we need to find some sustainable means of operating. 
 CA: Most of American electricity comes from,burning fossil fuels.,How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help? 
 EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.,One is that, even if you take the same source fuel,and produce power at the power plant,and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.,So if you take, say, natural gas,,which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,,if you burn that in a modern,General Electric natural gas turbine,,you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.,If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,,you get about 20 percent efficiency.,And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,,you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,,is voluminous,,and you can take the waste heat,and run a steam turbine and generate,a secondary power source.,So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,,even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off,charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant. 
 CA: That scale delivers efficiency. 
 EM: Yes, it does.,And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means,of power generation anyway, electricity generation.,So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,,then it makes sense for us to have electric cars,as the mode of transport. 
 CA: So we've got some video here,of the Tesla being assembled,,which, if we could play that first video --,So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle? 
 EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,,and I should say that I think, actually,,all modes of transport will become fully electric,with the ironic exception of rockets.,There's just no way around Newton's third law.,The question is how do you accelerate,the advent of electric transport?,And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with,a really energy efficient car,,so that means making it incredibly light,,and so what you're seeing here,is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car,made in North America.,In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques,to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.,And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient,of any car of its size.,So as a result, the energy usage is very low,,and it has the most advanced battery pack,,and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,,so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range. 
 CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,,but you think the math can still work out intelligently --,by combining light body, heavy battery,,you can still gain spectacular efficiency. 
 EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light,to offset the mass of the pack,,and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.,And in fact, customers of the Model S,are sort of competing with each other,to try to get the highest possible range.,I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge. 
 CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,,broke the world record.EM: Congratulations. 
 CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that,to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed,and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter) 
 EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --,if you drive it 65 miles an hour,,under normal conditions,,250 miles is a reasonable number. 
 CA: Let's show that second video,showing the Tesla in action on ice.,Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.,What is the most surprising thing about the experience,of driving the car? 
 EM: In creating an electric car,,the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.,So we wanted really to have people feel as though,they've almost got to mind meld with the car,,so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,,and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,,like the car has ESP.,You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.,You can't do that with a gasoline car.,I think that's really a profound difference,,and people only experience that when they have a test drive. 
 CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.,Is there a road map where this becomes,a mass-market vehicle? 
 EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been,to have a sort of three-step process,,where version one was an expensive car at low volume,,version two is medium priced and medium volume,,and then version three would be low price, high volume.,So we're at step two at this point.,So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.,Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.,And our third generation car, which should hopefully,be out in about three or four years,will be a $30,000 car.,But whenever you've got really new technology,,it generally takes about three major versions,in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.,And so I think we're making progress in that direction,,and I feel confident that we'll get there. 
 CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,,you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.,There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.,Do you see that coming, really, truly,,or just on a few key routes? 
 EM: There actually are far more charging stations,than people realize,,and at Tesla we developed something,called a Supercharging technology,,and we're offering that if you buy a Model S,for free, forever.,And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.,We actually have California and Nevada covered,,and we've got the Eastern seaboard,from Boston to D.C. covered.,By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive,from L.A. to New York,just using the Supercharger network,,which charges at five times the rate of anything else.,And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,,to stop time, of about six or seven.,So if you drive for three hours,,you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,,because that's normally what people will stop for.,So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,,by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,,hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going. 
 CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.,So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.,Wait for an hour, but the good news is,,you're helping save the planet,,and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. 
 EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people,to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.,It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles,and then stop for half an hour,and then keep going.,That's the natural cadence of a trip.,CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.,You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.,What's unusual about that? 
 EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,,we have to have sustainable electricity production,as well as consumption,,so I'm quite confident that the primary means,of power generation will be solar.,I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.,We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,,and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy,for purposes of human civilization.,What most people know but don't realize they know,is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.,If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball,at three degrees Kelvin,,and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.,The whole ecosystem is solar-powered. 
 CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,,effectively, thousands of years of sun power,compressed into a small space,,so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,,and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,,fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here? 
 EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar,will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas. 
 (Applause)CA: How? 
 EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble. 
 CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.,What are you doing?,EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system,or you can lease a solar system.,Most people choose to lease.,And the thing about solar power is that,it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,,so once it's installed, it's just there.,It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.,So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost,of that initial installation low,,and then get the cost of the financing low,,because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.,And we've made huge progress in that direction,,and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas. 
 CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,,don't pay so much up front. 
 EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.,We will install panels on your roof.,You will then pay, how long is a typical lease? 
 EM: Typical leases are 20 years,,but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.,It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.,Pretty good deal. 
 CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.,No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.,For you, the dream here then is that --,I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?,I mean, how do you, the company, benefit? 
 EM: Well, essentially,,SolarCity raises a chunk of capital,from say, a company or a bank.,Google is one of our big partners here.,And they have an expected return on that capital.,With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof,and then charges the homeowner or business owner,a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill. 
 CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.,You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility. 
 EM: Exactly. What it amounts to,is a giant distributed utility.,I think it's a good thing, because utilities,have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.,So effectively it's the first time,there's been competition for this monopoly,,because the utilities have been the only ones,that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.,So I think it's actually very empowering,for homeowners and businesses. 
 CA: And you really picture a future,where a majority of power in America,,within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar? 
 EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,,and most likely a majority,,and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.,I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is? 
 EM: More from solar than any other source. 
 CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with? 
 EM: With a friend who will remain nameless. 
 CA: Just between us. (Laughter) 
 EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,,so in roughly 18 years,,I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. 
 CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made,with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.,You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.,You decided to build a space company.,Why on Earth would someone do that?,(Laughter) 
 EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.,People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy,who made a small fortune in the space industry?",Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.,And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out,the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.,And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?" 
 CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened? 
 EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.,We came very close to failure,,but we managed to get through that point in 2008.,The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,,and in particular to try to crack a problem,that I think is vital,for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,,which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket. 
 CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?,So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?,You've dreamed of Mars and beyond? 
 EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,,but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.,It was really more from the standpoint of,what are the things that need to happen in order for,the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?,And I really think there's a fundamental difference,,if you sort of look into the future,,between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,,that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,,and I think that's really exciting,,compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth,until some eventual extinction event. 
 CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building,a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.,How on Earth have you done that?,NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this? 
 EM: Well, we've made significant advances,in the technology of the airframe, the engines,,the electronics and the launch operation.,There's a long list of innovations,that we've come up with there,that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but -- 
 CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?,You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. 
 EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's,more dangerous to patent than not to patent. 
 EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,,the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause) 
 CA: That's really, really interesting.,But the big innovation is still ahead,,and you're working on it now. Tell us about this. 
 EM: Right, so the big innovation— 
 CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here. 
 EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that,they're all expendable.,All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.,The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,,but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,,and the parts that were reusable,took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.,So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.,Obviously that doesn't work very well for — 
 CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land? 
 EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages,be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site,and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours. 
 CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause),And so what a lot of people don't realize is,,the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.,It's much like on a jet.,So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent,of the cost of the rocket.,So it's possible to achieve, let's say,,roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight,if you can effectively reuse the rocket.,That's why it's so important.,Every mode of transport that we use,,whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,,is reusable, but not rockets.,So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization. 
 CA: You asked me the question earlier,of how popular traveling on cruises would be,if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic. 
 CA: Definitely more expensive.,So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,,and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,,at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.,You'd like to see a colony on Mars. 
 EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination,of companies and governments, needs to make progress,in the direction of making life multi-planetary,,of establishing a base on another planet,,on Mars -- being the only realistic option --,and then building that base up,until we're a true multi-planet species. 
 CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,",how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.,How's it going? 
 EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently,with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,,where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,,the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.,And we've had some good tests. 
 CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.,So that's just to give a sense of scale.,We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash,and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter) 
 CA: All right, let's see that video then,,because this is actually amazing when you think about it.,You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then -- 
 EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size,of a 12-story building.,(Rocket launch),So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,,and it's constantly adjusting,the angle, the pitch nand yaw of the main engine,,and maintaining roll nwith cold gas thrusters. 
 CA: How cool is that? (Applause),Elon, how have you done this?,These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,,Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,,they're such ambitious projects at scale.,How on Earth has one person,been able to innovate in this way?,What is it about you? 
 EM: I don't know, actually.,I don't have a good answer for you.,I work a lot. I mean, a lot. 
 CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right. 
 CA: My theory is that you,have an ability to think at a system level of design,that pulls together design, technology and business,,so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,,into one package,,synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --,and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident,in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.,You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.,I mean, almost no one can do that.,Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?,Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?,It is truly amazing what you've done. 
 EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.,Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.,It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.,Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,,boil things down to their fundamental truths,and reason up from there,,as opposed to reasoning by analogy.,Through most of our life, we get through life,by reasoning by analogy,,which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.,And you have to do that.,Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.,But when you want to do something new,,you have to apply the physics approach.,Physics is really figuring out how to discover,new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.,It's really counterintuitive.,So I think that's an important thing to do,,and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,,and solicit it, particularly from friends.,This may sound like simple advice,,but hardly anyone does that,,and it's incredibly helpful. 
 CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.,Learn from this man.,Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED. 
 EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.,Look at that. (Applause) 
 Just take a bow. That was fantastic.,Thank you so much.Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,,and we both study complex networks.,And we met a couple years ago when we discovered,that we had both given a short TED Talk,about the ecology of war,,and we realized that we were connected,by the ideas we shared before we ever met.,And then we thought, you know, there are thousands,of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,,that are popping up all over the world.,How are they connected,,and what does that global conversation look like?,So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that. 
 Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks,from around the world, 147 different countries,,and we took these talks and we wanted to find,the mathematical structures that underly,the ideas behind them.,And we wanted to do that so we could see how,they connected with each other. 
 And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,,you need a lot of data.,So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,,and we can go down and basically pull,all the open information from YouTube,,all the comments, all the views, who's watching it,,where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.,But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,,we can pull the entire transcript,,and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.,So we can take their transcript,and actually do some pretty cool things.,We can take natural language processing algorithms,to kind of read through with a computer, line by line,,extracting key concepts from this.,And we take those key concepts and they sort of form,this mathematical structure of an idea.,And we call that the meme-ome.,And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,,is the mathematics that underlies an idea,,and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,,which I want to share with you now. 
 So each idea has its own meme-ome,,and each idea is unique with that,,but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,,they kind of steal sometimes,,and they certainly build on each other,,and we can go through mathematically,and take the meme-ome from one talk,and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,,and if there's a similarity between the two of them,,we can create a link and represent that as a graph,,just like Eric and I are connected. 
 So that's theory, that's great.,Let's see how it works in actual practice.,So what we've got here now is the global footprint,of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years,exploding out around the world,from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.,And what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,,and we started to see where the connections occurred,,where they connected with each other.,Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty,connected over into Europe.,We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine,radiating outwards from the Middle East.,And we've got something a little broader,like big data with a truly global footprint,reminiscent of a conversation,that is happening everywhere. 
 So from this, we kind of run up against the limits,of what we can actually do with a geographic projection,,but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out,into multidimensional space.,So we can take in our network projection,and apply a physics engine to this,,and the similar talks kind of smash together,,and the different ones fly apart,,and what we're left with is something quite beautiful. 
 EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,,they're linked if they share similar ideas,,and that comes from a machine reading,of entire talk transcripts,,and then all these topics that pop out,,they're not from tags and keywords.,They come from the network structure,of interconnected ideas. Keep going. 
 SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,,but he's going to slow me down.,We've got education connected to storytelling,triangulated next to social media.,You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,,which you might expect,,but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,,as those two spaces interface with each other. 
 But I want to take you into one cluster,that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.,And I want to kind of zoom in on that,and see if we can get a little more resolution.,So as we go in here, what we start to see,,apply the physics engine again,,we see what's one conversation,is actually composed of many smaller ones.,The structure starts to emerge,where we see a kind of fractal behavior,of the words and the language that we use,to describe the things that are important to us,all around this world.,So you've got food economy and local food at the top,,you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.,What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,,each connected to each other through the ideas,and the language they share,,creating a broader concept of the environment.,And of course, from here, we can go,and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?,And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.,This is their kind of resonance,for the conversation around the environment.,If we split along gender lines,,we can see females resonating heavily,with food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism. 
 And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,,and I'll throw to Eric for the next part. 
 EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,,you cannot get this kind of perspective,from a simple tag search on YouTube.,Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation,out of environment, and look at all the talks together.,Now often, when we're faced with this amount of content,,we do a couple of things to simplify it.,We might just say, well,,what are the most popular talks out there?,And a few rise to the surface.,There's a talk about gratitude.,There's another one about personal health and nutrition.,And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?,And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.,What's trending now? What's the popular talk now?,And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic,is about digital privacy. 
 So this is great. It simplifies things.,But there's so much creative content,that's just buried at the bottom.,And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface,that's maybe really creative and interesting?,Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas,to do that.,Remember, it's that network structure,that is creating these emergent topics,,and let's say we could take two of them,,like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks,that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.,And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix,is one of the hallmarks of innovation.,Well here's one by Jessica Green,about the microbial ecology of buildings.,It's literally defining a new field.,And we could go back to those topics and say, well,,what talks are central to those conversations?,In the cities cluster, one of the most central,was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,,and in the genetics cluster,,we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.,These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.,We could go the other direction and say, well,,what are talks that are broadly synthesizing,a lot of different kinds of fields.,We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.,Like, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,,very synthetic. 
 And then, of course, there are talks that are so unique,they're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,,and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.,And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,,and I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there,in the stratosphere of our idea space?",And apparently it smells like bacon.,I wouldn't know.,So we're using these network motifs,to find talks that are unique,,ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,,ones that are central to their topic,,and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.,Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession,with what's trending now.,And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,,or the patterns of how things are connected. 
 SG: So that's exactly right.,We've got ourselves in a world,that's massively complex,,and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down,so we can navigate through it.,And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,,are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,,because we can realize that their complexity is not random.,It has mathematical structure,,and we can use that mathematical structure,to go and explore things like the world of ideas,to see what's being said, to see what's not being said,,and to be a little bit more human,and, hopefully, a little smarter. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I'll be talking about the success of my campus,,the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,,in educating students of all types,,across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.,What makes our story especially important,is that we have learned so much from a group of students,who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder --,students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.,And what makes the story especially unique,is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,,students from low-income backgrounds,,to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering. 
 And so I begin with a story about my childhood.,We all are products of our childhood experiences.,It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years,since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,,a kid who loved getting A's,,a kid who loved math, who loved to read,,a kid who would say to the teacher --,when the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class,,this little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more.",And the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman.",And there was a designated kicker every day.,And so I was always asking this question:,"Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?" 
 And amazingly, one week in church,,when I really didn't want to be there,and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,,I heard this man say this:,"If we can get the children,to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,,we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong,and that children really do want to get the best possible education.",And I looked up and said, "Who is that man?",And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.,And I said to my parents, "I've got to go.,I want to go. I want to be a part of this.",And they said, "Absolutely not." 
 (Laughter) 
 And we had a rough go of it.,And at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.,And somehow I said, "You know, you guys are hypocrites.,You make me go to this. You make me listen.,The man wants me to go, and now you say no.",And they thought about it all night.,And they came into my room the next morning.,They had not slept.,They had been literally crying and praying and thinking,,"Will we let our 12-year-old,participate in this march and probably have to go to jail?",And they decided to do it.,And when they came in to tell me,,I was at first elated.,And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,,and I got really scared, I really did.,And one of the points I make to people all the time,is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,,it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.,It simply means that they believe it's important to do it. 
 I wanted a better education.,I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.,I wanted to know that the school I attended,not only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.,And as a result of that experience,,in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,,Dr. King came and said with our parents,,"What you children do this day,will have an impact on children who have not been born." 
 I recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today,had not been born at the time of 1963.,And so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,,in many ways, if they see it on TV,,it's like our looking at the 1863 "Lincoln" movie:,It's history.,And the real question is, what lessons did we learn?,Well amazingly, the most important for me was this:,That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.,They can be taught to be passionate,about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions. 
 And so it is especially significant,that the university I now lead,,the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,,was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.,And what made that institutional founding especially important,is that Maryland is the South, as you know,,and, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state,founded at a time when students of all races could go there.,And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.,And it has been for 50 years an experiment.,The experiment is this:,Is it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,,where people from all backgrounds can come and learn,and learn to work together and learn to become leaders,and to support each other in that experience? 
 Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this:,We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.,And so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.,And we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.,We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.,A lot of our students get into theater.,It's great work.,The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face --,that students in the sciences and engineering,,black students were not succeeding.,But when I looked at the data,,what I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,,large numbers were not making it.,And as a result of that,,we decided to do something that would help, first of all,,the group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students. 
 And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help.",Robert Meyerhoff said, "Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,,if it's not about basketball, is not positive?,I'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive.",We married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.,And what is significant about the program,is that we learned a number of things.,And the question is this:,How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans,who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?,That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.,That's a big deal. It really is. 
 (Applause) 
 You see, most people don't realize,that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.,Quite frankly, you're talking about Americans.,If you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics,who begin with a major in science and engineering,will actually graduate in science and engineering,,only 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas,actually succeed and graduate in those areas,,and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans. 
 And so, the real question is, what is the challenge?,Well a part of it, of course, is K-12.,We need to strengthen K-12.,But the other part has to do with the culture,of science and engineering on our campuses.,Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's,and large numbers of A.P. credits,who go to the most prestigious universities in our country,begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.,And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,,is they did not do well in first year science courses.,In fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,,weed-out courses or barrier courses. 
 How many of you in this audience know somebody,who started off in pre-med or engineering,and changed their major within a year or two?,It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.,I know. I know. I know.,And what is interesting about that,is that so many students are smart and can do it.,We need to find ways of making it happen. 
 So what are the four things we did to help minority students,that now are helping students in general?,Number one: high expectations.,It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students --,their grades, the rigor of the course work,,their test-taking skills, their attitude,,the fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.,And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.,But equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.,I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.,Smart simply means you're ready to learn.,You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions. 
 I. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,,all of his friends' parents would ask them,"What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day.,And he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,,"Izzy, did you ask a good question today?",And so high expectations have to do with curiosity,and encouraging young people to be curious.,And as a result of those high expectations,,we began to find students we wanted to work with,to see what could we do to help them,,not simply to survive in science and engineering,,but to become the very best, to excel. 
 Interestingly enough, an example:,One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,,we said, "We need to have you retake the course,,because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level.",Every foundation makes the difference in the next level.,He retook the course.,That young man went on to graduate from UMBC,,to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.,He now works at Harvard.,Nice story. Give him a hand for that too. 
 (Applause) 
 Secondly, it's not about test scores only.,Test scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.,One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.,But she had a factor that was very important.,She never missed a day of school, K-12.,There was fire in that belly.,That young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.,She's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.,She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.,Big hand for her. Big hand for her.,(Applause),And so high expectations, very important. 
 Secondly, the idea of building community among the students.,You all know that so often in science and engineering,we tend to think cutthroat.,Students are not taught to work in groups.,And that's what we work to do with that group,to get them to understand each other,,to build trust among them, to support each other,,to learn how to ask good questions,,but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.,As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,,it's another thing to help someone else do well.,And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.,So building community among those students, very important. 
 Third, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.,Whether you're talking about artists producing artists,or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,,whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example --,you need scientists to pull the students into the work.,And so our students are working in labs regularly. 
 And one great example that you'll appreciate:,During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,,the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant,literally came back to work in his lab after several days,,and all these students had refused to leave the lab.,They had food they had packed out.,They were in the lab working,,and they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.,They knew they were working on AIDS research.,They were looking at this amazing protein design.,And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.,And he said, "It doesn't get any better than that." 
 And then finally, if you've got the community,and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,,you have to have people who are willing as faculty,to get involved with those students, even in the classroom.,I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,,"I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,,and he seems like he's just not excited about the work.,He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him.",What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student,to understand who was really involved and who was not,and was saying, "Let me see how I can work with them.,Let me get the staff to help me out.",It was that connecting.,That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.,Give him a big hand for that. 
 (Applause) 
 And so the significance is that we have now developed this model,that is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.,And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.,And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.,But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.,Because so many students are bored in class.,Do you know that?,Many students, K-12 and in universities,,don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.,They need to be engaged. 
 And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,,you'll see people coming from all over the country,to look at how we are redesigning courses,,having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,,using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,,and not giving students the theories,,but having them struggle with those theories.,And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,,more and more courses are being redesigned. 
 It's called academic innovation. 
 And what does all of that mean?,It means that now, not just in science and engineering,,we now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,,in teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.,If you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline,in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.,And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference,will be building community among students,,telling young women, young minority students and students in general,,you can do this work.,And most important, giving them a chance to build that community,with faculty pulling them into the work,and our assessing what works and what does not work.,Most important, if a student has a sense of self,,it is amazing how the dreams and the values,can make all the difference in the world. 
 When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,,I kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be.",I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham,to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,,where students are not there just to survive,,where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,,where they will one day change the world. 
 Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.,It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.,It represents the wisest option among many alternatives.",And then he said something that gives me goosebumps.,He said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny.",Choice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values. 
 Thank you all very much. 
 (Applause)When I was little, I thought my countrynwas the best on the planet.,And I grew up singing a songncalled "Nothing To Envy.",And I was very proud.,In school, we spent a lot of timenstudying the history of Kim Il-Sung,,but we never learned muchnabout the outside world,,except that America, South Korea,nJapan are the enemies.,Although I often wonderednabout the outside world,,I thought I would spendnmy entire life in North Korea,,until everything suddenly changed. 
 When I was seven years old,nI saw my first public execution.,But I thought my lifenin North Korea was normal.,My family was not poor,,and myself, I had nevernexperienced hunger. 
 But one day, in 1995,nmy mom brought home a letter,from a coworker's sister.,It read, "When you read this,,our five family membersnwill not exist in this world,,because we haven't eatennfor the past three weeks.,We are lying on the floor together,,and our bodies are so weak,nwe are waiting to die." 
 I was so shocked.,This was the first time I heardnthat people in my country were suffering.,Soon after, when I was walkingnpast a train station,,I saw something terrible that to this daynI can't erase from my memory.,A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,,while an emaciated child in her arms,just stared helplesslynat his mother's face.,But nobody helped them,,because they were so focused on takingncare of themselves and their families. 
 A huge famine hit North Koreanin the mid-1990s.,Ultimately, more than a millionnNorth Koreans died during the famine,,and many only survived by eatingngrass, bugs and tree bark.,Power outages also becamenmore and more frequent,,so everything around menwas completely dark at night,,except for the sea of lights in China,,just across the river from my home.,I always wonderednwhy they had lights, but we didn't.,This is a satellite picturenshowing North Korea at night,,compared to neighbors. 
 This is the Amnok River,,which serves as a part of the bordernbetween North Korea and China.,As you can see, the river can benvery narrow at certain points,,allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.,But many die.,Sometimes, I saw dead bodiesnfloating down the river.,I can't reveal many detailsnabout how I left North Korea,,but I only can say thatnduring the ugly years of the famine,,I was sent to China to livenwith distant relatives.,But I only thought that I wouldnbe separated from my family,for a short time.,I could have never imagined,that it would take 14 yearsnto live together. 
 In China, it was hard livingnas a young girl without my family.,I had no idea what lifenwas going to be like,as a North Korean refugee.,But I soon learned it's notnonly extremely difficult,,it's also very dangerous,,since North Korean refugees are considerednin China as illegal migrants.,So I was living in constant fearnthat my identity could be revealed,,and I would be repatriatednto a horrible fate,,back in North Korea. 
 One day, my worst nightmare came true,,when I was caught by the Chinese police,,and brought to the police stationnfor interrogation.,Someone had accused menof being North Korean,,so they tested my Chinesenlanguage abilities,,and asked me tons of questions.,I was so scared.,I thought my heart was going to explode.,If anything seemed unnatural,nI could be imprisoned and repatriated.,I thought my life was over.,But I managed to controlnall the emotions inside me,,and answer the questions.,After they finished questioning me,,one official said to another,,"This was a false report.nShe's not North Korean.",And they let me go. It was a miracle. 
 Some North Koreans in Chinanseek asylum in foreign embassies.,But many can be caughtnby the Chinese police,,and repatriated.,These girls were so lucky.,Even though they were caught,,they were eventually released,nafter heavy international pressure.,These North Koreans were not so lucky.,Every year, countless North Koreansnare caught in China,and repatriated to North Korea,,where they can be tortured, imprisoned,nor publicly executed. 
 Even though I wasnreally fortunate to get out,,many other North Koreansnhave not been so lucky.,It's tragic that North Koreansnhave to hide their identities,and struggle so hard just to survive.,Even after learning a newnlanguage and getting a job,,their whole world can be turnednupside down in an instant.,That's why, after 10 yearsnof hiding my identity,,I decided to risk going to South Korea.,And I started a new life yet again. 
 Settling down in South Korea,was a lot more challengingnthan I had expected.,English was so important in South Korea,,so I had to start learningnmy third language.,Also, I realized there was a wide gapnbetween North and South.,We are all Korean, but inside,,we have become very different,ndue to 67 years of division.,I even went through an identity crisis.,Am I South Korean or North Korean?,Where am I from? Who am I?,Suddenly, there was no countrynI could proudly call my own. 
 Even though adjusting to lifenin South Korea was not easy,,I made a plan -- I started studyingnfor the university entrance exam. 
 Just as I was startingnto get used to my new life,,I received a shocking phone call.,The North Korean authoritiesnintercepted some money,that I sent to my family,,and, as a punishment, my familynwas going to be forcibly removed,to a desolate location in the countryside.,They had to get out quickly.,So I started planningnhow to help them escape. 
 North Koreans have to travelnincredible distances,on the path to freedom.,It's almost impossible to cross the border,between North Korea and South Korea.,So, ironically, I tookna flight back to China,and headed toward the North Korean border.,Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,,I had to guide them somehownthrough more than 2,000 miles,in China, and then into Southeast Asia.,The journey by bus took one week,,and we were almost caught several times.,One time, our bus was stoppednand boarded by a Chinese police officer.,He took everyone's I.D. cards,,and he started asking them questions.,Since my family couldn'tnunderstand Chinese,,I thought my familynwas going to be arrested.,As the Chinese officernapproached my family,,I impulsively stood up, and I told him,that these are deaf and dumb peoplenthat I was chaperoning.,He looked at me suspiciously,,but luckily, he believed me. 
 We made it all the waynto the border of Laos.,But I had to spend almost all my money,to bribe the border guards in Laos.,But even after we got past the border,,my family was arrested and jailednfor illegal border crossing.,After I paid the fine and bribe,,my family was released in one month.,But soon after, my familynwas arrested and jailed again,,in the capital of Laos. 
 This was one of the lowestnpoints in my life.,I did everything to getnmy family to freedom,,and we came so close,,but my family was thrown in jail,,just a short distancenfrom the South Korean embassy.,I went back and forthnbetween the immigration office,and the police station,,desperately trying to get my family out.,but I didn't have enough moneynto pay a bribe or fine anymore.,I lost all hope. 
 At that moment, I heardnone man's voice ask me,,"What's wrong?",I was so surprised that a total strangerncared enough to ask.,In my broken English,nand with a dictionary,,I explained the situation,nand without hesitating,,the man went to the ATM,,and he paid the restnof the money for my family,,and two other North Koreansnto get out of jail. 
 I thanked him with all my heart,nand I asked him,,"Why are you helping me?" 
 "I'm not helping you," he said.,"I'm helping the North Korean people." 
 I realized that thisnwas a symbolic moment in my life.,The kind stranger symbolized new hopenfor me and the North Korean people,,when we needed it most.,And he showed menthat the kindness of strangers,and the supportnof the international community,are truly the rays of hopenwe North Korean people need. 
 Eventually, after our long journey,,my family and I were reunitednin South Korea.,But getting to freedomnis only half the battle.,Many North Koreansnare separated from their families,,and when they arrive in a new country,,they start with little or no money.,So we can benefitnfrom the international community,for education, English language training,njob training, and more.,We can also act as a bridge,between the people inside North Koreanand the outside world.,Because many of us stay in contactnwith family members still inside,,and we send information and money,that is helping to changenNorth Korea from inside. 
 I've been so lucky, receivednso much help and inspiration in my life,,so I want to help givenaspiring North Koreans,a chance to prospernwith international support.,I'm confident that you will seenmore and more North Koreans,succeeding all over the world,,including the TED stage. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals',latest and nastiest creations.,So basically, please don't go and download,any of the viruses that I show you. 
 Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,,and I thought I'd give you a quick insight,into my career so far.,It's a pretty accurate description.,This is what someone that specializes,in malware and hacking looks like. 
 So today, computer viruses and trojans,,designed to do everything from stealing data,to watching you in your webcam,to the theft of billions of dollars.,Some malicious code today goes as far,as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure. 
 Let me give you a quick snapshot,of what malicious code is capable of today.,Right now, every second, eight new users,are joining the Internet.,Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.,We will see 30,000 new infected websites.,And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,,lots of people think that when you get infected,with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.,Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,,if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.,People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter),Actually, about 80 percent of these,are small business websites getting infected. 
 Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?,Well, many of you have the image, don't you,,of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,,hacking away for notoriety.,But actually today, cybercriminals,are wonderfully professional and organized.,In fact, they have product adverts.,You can go online and buy a hacking service,to knock your business competitor offline.,Check out this one I found. 
 (Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,,and that reason is,because you need your business competitors,,rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,,they are to go down.,Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.,If you want your business competitors to go down,,well, they can.,If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.,Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term,DDOS service or scheduled attack,,starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites,to 10 to 50 dollars per hour. 
 James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay,one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.,Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.,Turns out that's not cool.,But regardless, it's amazing how many products,and services are available now to cybercriminals.,For example, this testing platform,,which enables the cybercriminals,to test the quality of their viruses,before they release them on the world.,For a small fee, they can upload it,and make sure everything is good. 
 But it goes further.,Cybercriminals now have crime packs,with business intelligence reporting dashboards,to manage the distribution of their malicious code.,This is the market leader in malware distribution,,the Black Hole Exploit Pack,,responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution,in the last couple of quarters.,It comes with technical installation guides,,video setup routines,,and get this, technical support.,You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you,how to set up your illegal hacking server. 
 So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.,What I've got here is two systems,,an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,,and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.,Now normally, these would be on different sides,of the planet or of the Internet,,but I've put them side by side,because it makes things much more interesting. 
 Now, there are many ways you can get infected.,You will have come in contact with some of them.,Maybe some of you have received an email,that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,,and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars,because I like your face.",Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it,was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America. 
 Now there are many ways you can get infected.,I want to show you a couple of my favorites.,This is a little USB key.,Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?,Well, you could try looking really cute.,Awww.,Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.,So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,,looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.,which I've covered in coffee,,and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key,and print me a new one.,So let's have a look here on my victim computer.,What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.,After a couple of seconds,,things start to happen on the computer on their own,,usually a bad sign.,This would, of course, normally happen,in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,,but I've kind of slowed it down,so you can actually see the attack occurring.,Malware is very boring otherwise.,So this is writing out the malicious code,,and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,,you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.,Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,,this is what we call a command prompt,,and using this we can navigate around the computer.,We can access your documents, your data.,You can turn on the webcam.,That can be very embarrassing.,Or just to really prove a point,,we can launch programs like my personal favorite,,the Windows Calculator. 
 So isn't it amazing how much control,the attackers can get with such a simple operation?,Let me show you how most malware,is now distributed today.,What I'm going to do is open up a website,that I wrote.,It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.,And it's got a comments section here,where we can submit comments to the website.,Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.,Unfortunately, when this was implemented,,the developer was slightly inebriated,and managed to forget,all of the secure coding practices he had learned.,So let's imagine that our attacker,,called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,,inserts something a little nasty.,This is a script.,It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.,So I'm going to submit this post,,and then, on my victim computer,,I'm going to open up the web browser,and browse to my website,,www.incrediblyhacked.com.,Notice that after a couple of seconds,,I get redirected.,That website address at the top there,,which you can just about see, microshaft.com,,the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,,and up pops fake antivirus.,This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,,and it will go through and it will scan the system,,have a look at what its popping up here.,It creates some very serious alerts.,Oh look, a child porn proxy server.,We really should clean that up.,What's really insulting about this is,not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,,but when the scan finishes, they tell you,in order to clean up the fake viruses,,you have to register the product.,Now I liked it better when viruses were free.,(Laughter),People now pay cybercriminals money,to run viruses,,which I find utterly bizarre. 
 So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.,Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day,is a massive challenge,,and those numbers are only growing,directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.,So I want to talk to you briefly,about a group of hackers we tracked for a year,and actually found --,and this is a rare treat in our job.,Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,,people from Facebook, independent researchers,,guys from Sophos.,So here we have a couple of documents,which our cybercriminals had uploaded,to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,,like many of you might use.,At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.,What this would do is send the cybercriminals,a text message every day telling them how much money,they'd made that day,,so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.,If you look closely, you'll notice a series,of what are Russian telephone numbers.,Now that's obviously interesting,,because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.,Down below, highlighted in red,,in the other section of source code,,is this bit "leded:leded.",That's a username,,kind of like you might have on Twitter. 
 So let's take this a little further.,There are a few other interesting pieces,the cybercriminals had uploaded.,Lots of you here will use smartphones,to take photos and post them from the conference.,An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones,is that when you take a photo,,it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.,In fact, I've been spending a lot of time,on Internet dating sites recently,,obviously for research purposes,,and I've noticed that about 60 percent,of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites,contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,,which is kind of scary,because you wouldn't give out your home address,to lots of strangers,,but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates,to plus or minus 15 meters.,And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.,So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.,We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.,We used Google.,Using the email address, the telephone number,and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert,for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,,on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.,One of these was more stereotypical for me.,A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.,Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals,sharing information scarcely.,Imagine what you could find,about each of the people in this room.,A bit more searching through the profile,and there's a photo of their office.,They were working on the third floor.,And you can also see some photos,from his business companion,where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.,It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation. 
 But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.,The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.,And herein is the greatest lesson,of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.,Our friends, our families and our colleagues,can break our security even when we do the right things.,This is MobSoft, one of the companies,that this cybercriminal gang owned,,and an interesting thing about MobSoft,is the 50-percent owner of this,posted a job advert,,and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers,from the code earlier.,This woman was Maria,,and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.,And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings,and clicked on every option imaginable,to make herself really, really insecure.,By the end of the investigation,,where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,,we had photos of the cybercriminals,,even the office Christmas party,when they were out on an outing.,That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,,as it turns out.,Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.,Let me come back to that in just a minute. 
 I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,,a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,,but is interesting in exposing how much information,we're all giving away,,and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.,This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets,trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately. 
 Many of you all know about the concept,of scanning for wireless networks.,You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry,and connect to something like TEDAttendees.,But what you might not know,is that you're also beaming out a list of networks,you've previously connected to,,even when you're not using wireless actively.,So I ran a little scan.,I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,,who wouldn't be so concerned by law,,and here you can see my mobile device.,Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.,TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?,My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,,which I think is a great name.,Sophos\_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.,Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.,CIASurveillanceVan.,We called it that at one of our conferences,because we thought that would freak people out,,which is quite fun.,This is how geeks party. 
 So let's make this a little bit more interesting.,Let's talk about you.,Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks,recently and used the wireless network.,Things get more interesting.,Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,,XYZ Employee network.,This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.,Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,,absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.,Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.,Your wireless network name is so unique,that I was able to pinpoint it,using data available openly on the Internet,with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.,And I should mention as well that,some of you do use your names,,"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.,And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity. 
 So something for you to think about:,As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,,as we play with these shiny new toys,,how much are we trading off convenience,for privacy and security?,Next time you install something,,look at the settings and ask yourself,,"Is this information that I want to share?,Would someone be able to abuse it?" 
 We also need to think very carefully,about how we develop our future talent pool.,You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,,and that 250,000 pieces of malware,won't stay the same for long.,There's a very concerning trend,that whilst many people coming out of schools now,are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,,fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects,to know how that technology works under the covers.,In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,,and there are similar statistics all over the world. 
 We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.,The cybercriminals I talked about,,despite theft of millions of dollars,,actually still haven't been arrested,,and at this point possibly never will.,Most laws are national in their implementation,,despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet,is borderless and international by definition.,Countries do not agree, which makes this area,exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective. 
 But my biggest ask is this:,You see, you're going to leave here,and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.,You're going to read about malware doing incredible,and terrifying, scary things.,However, 99 percent of it works,because people fail to do the basics.,So my ask is this: Go online,,find these simple best practices,,find out how to update and patch your computer.,Get a secure password.,Make sure you use a different password,on each of your sites and services online.,Find these resources. Apply them. 
 The Internet is a fantastic resource,for business, for political expression,,for art and for learning.,Help me and the security community,make life much, much more difficult,for cybercriminals. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, we used to solve big problems.,On July 21st, 1969,,Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module,and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.,Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,,but their presence on the moon's gray surface,was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort. 
 The Apollo program was the greatest,peacetime mobilization,in the history of the United States.,To get to the moon, NASA spent,around 180 billion dollars in today's money,,or four percent of the federal budget.,Apollo employed around 400,000 people,and demanded the collaboration of 20,000,companies, universities and government agencies.,People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.,But before the Apollo program ended,,24 men flew to the moon.,Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,,following the death of Armstrong last year,,is now the most senior. 
 So why did they go?,They didn't bring much back:,841 pounds of old rocks,,and something all 24 later emphasized --,a new sense of the smallness,and the fragility of our common home.,Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went,because President Kennedy wanted to show,the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.,But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962,provide a better clue. 
 (Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?,Why choose this as our goal?,And they may well ask,,why climb the highest mountain?,Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?,Why does Rice play Texas?,We choose to go to the moon.,We choose to go to the moon.,(Applause),We choose to go to the moon in this decade,,and do the other things,,not because they are easy, but because they are hard. 
 Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,,Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East,in the Cold War.,At the time, the strongest emotion,was of wonder,at the transcendent powers of technology.,They went because it was a big thing to do.,Landing on the moon occurred in the context,of a long series of technological triumphs.,The first half of the 20th century produced,the assembly line and the airplane,,penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.,In the middle years of the century,,polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.,Technology itself seemed to possess,what Alvin Toffler in 1970,called "accelerative thrust.",For most of human history,,we could go no faster than a horse,or a boat with a sail,,but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10,flew at 25,000 miles an hour. 
 Since 1970, no human beings,have been back to the moon.,No one has traveled faster than the crew,of Apollo 10,,and blithe optimism about technology's powers,has evaporated,as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,,such as going to Mars,,creating clean energy, curing cancer,,or feeding the world have come to seem,intractably hard. 
 I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.,I was five years old,,and my mother told me not to stare,at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.,I vaguely knew this was to be the last,of the moon missions,,but I was absolutely certain there would be,Mars colonies in my lifetime. 
 So "Something happened,to our capacity to solve big problems with technology",has become a commonplace.,You hear it all the time.,We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.,It feels as if technologists have diverted us,and enriched themselves with trivial toys,,with things like iPhones and apps and social media,,or algorithms that speed automated trading.,There's nothing wrong with most of these things.,They've expanded and enriched our lives.,But they don't solve humanity's big problems. 
 What happened?,So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,,which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies,than it did in the years when it financed,Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.,Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,,in particular the incentives that venture capitalists,offer to entrepreneurs.,Silicon Valley says that venture investing,shifted away from funding transformational ideas,and towards funding incremental problems,or even fake problems.,But I don't think that explanation is good enough.,It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.,Even when venture capitalists were at their most,risk-happy, they preferred small investments,,tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.,V.C.s have always struggled,to invest profitably in technologies such as energy,whose capital requirements are huge,and whose development is long and lengthy,,and V.C.s have never, never funded the development,of technologies meant to solve big problems,that possess no immediate commercial value.,No, the reasons we can't solve big problems,are more complicated and more profound. 
 Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.,We could go to Mars if we want.,NASA even has the outline of a plan.,But going to Mars would follow a political decision,with popular appeal, and that will never happen.,We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks,there are more important things,to do here on Earth. 
 Sometimes, we can't solve big problems,because our political systems fail.,Today, less than two percent,of the world's energy consumption,derives from advanced, renewable sources,such as solar, wind and biofuels,,less than two percent,,and the reason is purely economic.,Coal and natural gas are cheaper,than solar and wind,,and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.,We want alternative energy sources,that can compete on price. None exist.,Now, technologists, business leaders,and economists all basically agree,on what national policies and international treaties,would spur the development of alternative energy:,mostly, a significant increase in energy,research and development,,and some kind of price on carbon.,But there's no hope in the present political climate,that we will see U.S. energy policy,or international treaties that reflect that consensus. 
 Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological,turn out not to be so.,Famines were long understood to be caused,by failures in food supply.,But 30 years of research have taught us,that famines are political crises,that catastrophically affect food distribution.,Technology can improve things like crop yields,or systems for storing and transporting food,,but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments. 
 Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution,because we don't really understand the problem.,President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,,but we soon discovered,there are many kinds of cancer,,most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,,and it is only in the last 10 years,that effective, viable therapies,have come to seem real.,Hard problems are hard. 
 It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.,We can, we must, but these four elements,must all be present:,Political leaders and the public,must care to solve a problem;,institutions must support its solution;,It must really be a technological problem;,and we must understand it. 
 The Apollo mission,,which has become a kind of metaphor,for technology's capacity to solve big problems,,met these criteria.,But it is an irreproducible model for the future.,It is not 1961.,There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,,no politician like John Kennedy,who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,,and no popular science fictional mythology,such as exploring the solar system.,Most of all, going to the moon,turned out to be easy.,It was just three days away.,And arguably it wasn't even solving,much of a problem. 
 We are left alone with our day,,and the solutions of the future will be harder won.,God knows, we don't lack for the challenges. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We always hear that texting is a scourge.,The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall,of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,,among young people in the United States,and now the whole world today.,The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,,and it's easy to think that it is true,,but in order to see it in another way,,in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,,not just energetic, but a miraculous thing,,a kind of emergent complexity,that we're seeing happening right now,,we have to pull the camera back for a bit,and look at what language really is,,in which case, one thing that we see,is that texting is not writing at all.,What do I mean by that? 
 Basically, if we think about language,,language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,,at least 80,000 years,,and what it arose as is speech. People talked.,That's what we're probably genetically specified for.,That's how we use language most.,Writing is something that came along much later,,and as we saw in the last talk,,there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,,but according to traditional estimates,,if humanity had existed for 24 hours,,then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.,That's how much of a latterly thing writing is.,So first there's speech, and then writing comes along,as a kind of artifice. 
 Now don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.,When you write, because it's a conscious process,,because you can look backwards,,you can do things with language that are much less likely,if you're just talking.,For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's,"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:" 
 "The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,,till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed,into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example,was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself." 
 That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.,Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested,in reproducing. That --,(Laughter),is not the way any human being speaks casually. 
 Casual speech is something quite different.,Linguists have actually shown,that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,,we tend to speak in word packets of maybe,seven to 10 words.,You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record,yourself or a group of people talking.,That's what speech is like.,Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.,It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.,So we naturally tend to think, because we see language,written so often, that that's what language is,,but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things. 
 Now of course, as history has gone by,,it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed,between speech and writing.,So, for example, in a distant era now,,it was common when one gave a speech,to basically talk like writing.,So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving,in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,,"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak,in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.,It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.,It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,,we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln,because of the movie.,The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.,For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke,on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today,and barely did then.,The point of it was to listen to him,speaking like writing.,Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.,It was perfectly natural.,That's what people did then, speaking like writing. 
 Well, if you can speak like writing,,then logically it follows that you might want to also,sometimes write like you speak.,The problem was just that in the material,,mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day,for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.,It's almost impossible to do that with your hand,except in shorthand, and then communication is limited.,On a manual typewriter it was very difficult,,and even when we had electric typewriters,,or then computer keyboards, the fact is,that even if you can type easily enough to keep up,with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have,somebody who can receive your message quickly. 
 Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,,then you have the conditions that allow,that we can write like we speak.,And that's where texting comes in.,And so, texting is very loose in its structure.,No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,,but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?,No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting? 
 What texting is, despite the fact that it involves,the brute mechanics of something that we call writing,,is fingered speech. That's what texting is.,Now we can write the way we talk.,And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless,easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.,We see this general bagginess of the structure,,the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to,learning on the blackboard, and so we think,that something has gone wrong.,It's a very natural sense. 
 But the fact of the matter is that what is going on,is a kind of emergent complexity.,That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.,And in order to understand it, what we want to see,is the way, in this new kind of language,,there is new structure coming up. 
 And so, for example, there is in texting a convention,,which is LOL.,Now LOL, we generally think of,as meaning "laughing out loud.",And of course, theoretically, it does,,and if you look at older texts, then people used it,to actually indicate laughing out loud.,But if you text now, or if you are someone who,is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,,you'll notice that LOL,does not mean laughing out loud anymore.,It's evolved into something that is much subtler. 
 This is an actual text that was done,by a non-male person of about 20 years old,not too long ago. 
 "I love the font you're using, btw." 
 Julie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now" 
 Now if you think about it, that's not funny.,No one's laughing. (Laughter),And yet, there it is, so you assume,there's been some kind of hiccup. 
 Then Susan says "lol, I know,",again more guffawing than we're used to,when you're talking about these inconveniences. 
 So Julie says, "I just sent you an email." 
 Susan: "lol, I see it." 
 Very funny people, if that's what LOL means. 
 This Julie says, "So what's up?" 
 Susan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper." 
 She's not amused. Let's think about it.,LOL is being used in a very particular way.,It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.,We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.,Any spoken language that's used by real people has them.,If you happen to speak Japanese, think about,that little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.,If you listen to the way black youth today speak,,think about the use of the word "yo.",Whole dissertations could be written about it,,and probably are being written about it.,A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.,It's a way of using the language between actual people. 
 Another example is "slash.",Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,,along the lines of, "We're going to have,a party-slash-networking session.",That's kind of like what we're at.,Slash is used in a very different way,in texting among young people today.,It's used to change the scene. 
 So for example, this Sally person says,,"So I need to find people to chill with",and Jake says, "Haha" --,you could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that —,"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?" 
 Sally: "For this summer program at NYU." 
 Jake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players,trying to shoot with one eye." 
 The slash is interesting.,I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,,but you notice that he's changing the topic.,Now that seems kind of mundane,,but think about how in real life,,if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,,there are ways of doing it gracefully.,You don't just zip right into it.,You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,,or you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think --",when it really didn't, but what you're really --,(Laughter) —,what you're really trying to do is change the topic.,You can't do that while you're texting,,and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.,All spoken languages have what a linguist calls,a new information marker -- or two, or three.,Texting has developed one from this slash. 
 So we have a whole battery of new constructions,that are developing, and yet it's easy to think,,well, something is still wrong.,There's a lack of structure of some sort.,It's not as sophisticated,as the language of The Wall Street Journal.,Well, the fact of the matter is,,look at this person in 1956,,and this is when texting doesn't exist,,"I Love Lucy" is still on the air. 
 "Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,,cannot write grammatically -- " 
 We've heard that sort of thing before,,not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.,1917. This is the time when we all assume,that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect,because the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,,or something like that. 
 So, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,,'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'" 
 And so on. You can go even further back than this.,It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.,There's no electricity. People have three names. 
 "Bad spelling,,incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing." 
 And he's talking about people who are otherwise,well prepared for college studies. 
 You can go even further back.,1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset,because of what he has for a long time "noted with regret,the almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah. 
 Or you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. -- (Laughter) --,and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way,people are speaking Latin.,As it happens, he was writing about what had become French.,And so, there are always — (Laughter) (Applause) —,there are always people worrying about these things,and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning. 
 And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is,that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing,that young people are developing,,which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,,and that means that they're able to do two things.,Increasing evidence is that being bilingual,is cognitively beneficial.,That's also true of being bidialectal.,That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.,And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act,that young people are using today, not consciously, of course,,but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.,It's very simple.,If somebody from 1973 looked at,what was on a dormitory message board in 1993,,the slang would have changed a little bit,since the era of "Love Story,",but they would understand what was on that message board.,Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago,,this is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- those people.,Take those people and they read,a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.,Often they would have no idea what half of it meant,because a whole new language has developed,among our young people doing something as mundane,as what it looks like to us when they're batting around,on their little devices. 
 So in closing, if I could go into the future,,if I could go into 2033,,the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon,had done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.,And — I really would ask that —,and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey.",That'd be the second thing.,And then the third thing would be,,please show me a sheaf of texts,written by 16-year-old girls,,because I would want to know where this language,had developed since our times,,and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now,so we could examine this linguistic miracle,happening right under our noses.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,,where I work as a curator.,It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,,and that it grows,,and basically it means I collect dead animals.,Back in 1995,,we got a new wing next to the museum.,It was made of glass,,and this building really helped me to do my job good.,The building was a true bird-killer.,You may know that birds don't understand,the concept of glass. They don't see it,,so they fly into the windows and get killed.,The only thing I had to do was go out,,pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.,(Laughter),And in those days,,I developed an ear to identify birds,just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass. 
 And it was on June 5, 1995,,that I heard a loud bang against the glass,that changed my life and ended that of a duck.,And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.,This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.,It's laying dead on its belly.,But next to the dead duck is a live duck,,and please pay attention.,Both are of the male sex.,And then this happened.,The live duck mounted the dead duck,,and started to copulate. 
 Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.,I said, "Something's wrong here.",One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.,I look. Both are of the male sex.,Homosexual necrophilia. 
 So I -- (Laughter) 
 I took my camera, I took my notebook,,took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.,After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —,I had seen enough, and I got hungry,,and I wanted to go home.,So I went out, collected the duck,,and before I put it in the freezer,,I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.,And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,,so it was indeed of the male sex.,It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds,and only 300 possess a penis. 
 [The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)] 
 I knew I'd seen something special,,but it took me six years to decide to publish it.,(Laughter),I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party,or at the coffee machine,,but to share this among your peers is something different.,I didn't have the framework.,So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,,so I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia,in the mallard.",And here's the situation again.,A is my office,,B is the place where the duck hit the glass,,and C is from where I watched it.,And here are the ducks again. 
 As you probably know, in science,,when you write a kind of special paper,,only six or seven people read it.,(Laughter),But then something good happened.,I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,,and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:,the Ig Nobel Prize.",And the Ig Nobel Prize —,(Laughter) (Applause) —,the Ig Nobel Prize honors research,that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,,with the ultimate goal to make more people,interested in science.,That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.,(Laughter) 
 I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams,didn't call me from Stockholm.,He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.,So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,,and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony,held at Harvard University, and this ceremony,is a very nice experience.,Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.,That's the first thing.,And there are nine other winners who get prizes.,Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton,who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,,"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans,under farming conditions in Britain.",(Laughter),And I think there are one or two more,Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.,Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?,Applause for Dan.,(Applause),Dan won his prize in medicine,for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine,works better than low-priced fake medicine.,(Laughter) 
 So here's my one minute of fame,,my acceptance speech,,and here's the duck.,This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.,I'm going to pass it around.,(Laughter),Yeah?,You can pass it around.,Please note it's a museum specimen,,but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu. 
 After winning this prize, my life changed.,In the first place, people started to send me,all kinds of duck-related things,,and I got a real nice collection.,(Laughter),More importantly,,people started to send me their observations,of remarkable animal behavior,,and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,,I know about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a moose.,It's a moose trying to copulate,with a bronze statue of a bison.,This is in Montana, 2008.,This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.,This is the Netherlands, 2011.,These are cane toads in Australia.,This is roadkill.,Please note that this is necrophilia.,It's remarkable: the position.,The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.,These are pigeons in Rotterdam.,Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.,This is a turkey in Wisconsin,on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.,It took all day,,and the prisoners had a great time. 
 So what does this mean?,I mean, the question I ask myself,,why does this happen in nature?,Well, what I concluded,from reviewing all these cases,is that it is important that this happens,only when death is instant,and in a dramatic way,and in the right position for copulation.,At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.,And here you see a dead duck.,It's been there for three days,,and it's laying on its back.,So there goes my theory of necrophilia. 
 Another example of the impact,of glass buildings on the life of birds.,This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.,The only thing this bird did was fly against this window,from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.,Here he goes, and here's a short video. 
 (Music) (Clunk),(Clunk),(Clunk),(Clunk) 
 So what this bird does,is fight his own image.,He sees an intruder in his territory,,and it's coming all the time and he's there,,so there is no end to it.,And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --,that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?,It's not. I show you here some slides,,some frames from the video,,and at the last moment before he hits the glass,,he puts his feet in front,,and then he bangs against the glass. 
 So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.,That's on June 5 every year.,At five minutes to six in the afternoon,,we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,,the duck comes out of the museum,,and we try to discuss new ways,to prevent birds from colliding with windows.,And as you know, or as you may not know,,this is one of the major causes of death,for birds in the world.,In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die,in collision with glass buildings.,And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant,and we have a six-course duck dinner. 
 So I hope to see you,next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,,for Dead Duck Day.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Oh, sorry.,May I have my duck back, please? 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Thank you.So imagine, you're in the supermarket,,you're buying some groceries,,and you get given the option,for a plastic or a paper shopping bag.,Which one do you choose if you want to do,the right thing by the environment? 
 Most people do pick the paper.,Okay, let's think of why.,It's brown to start with.,Therefore, it must be good for the environment.,It's biodegradable. It's reusable.,In some cases, it's recyclable.,So when people are looking at the plastic bag,,it's likely they're thinking of something like this,,which we all know is absolutely terrible,,and we should be avoiding at all expenses,these kinds of environmental damages.,But people are often not thinking,of something like this,,which is the other end of the spectrum.,When we produce materials,,we need to extract them from the environment,,and we need a whole bunchnof environmental impacts. 
 You see, what happens is, when we need,to make complex choices,,us humans like really simple solutions,,and so we often ask for simple solutions.,And I work in design.,I advise designers,and innovators around sustainability,,and everyone always says to me, "Oh Leyla,,I just want the eco-materials." 
 And I say, "Well, that's very complex,,and we'll have to spend four hours talking about,what exactly an eco-material means,,because everything at some point,comes from nature,,and it's how you use the material,that dictates the environmental impact.,So what happens is, we have to rely,on some sort of intuitive framework,when we make decisions.,So I like to call that intuitive framework,our environmental folklore.,It's either the little voicenat the back of your head,,or it's that gut feeling you get,when you've done the right thing,,so when you've picked the paper bag,or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.,And environmental folklore is a really important thing,because we're trying to do the right thing.,But how do we know if we're actually,reducing the net environmental impacts,that our actions as individuals and as professionals,and as a society are actually having,on the natural environment? 
 So the thing about environmental folklore is,it tends to be based on our experiences,,the things we've heard from other people.,It doesn't tend to be basednon any scientific framework.,And this is really hard, because we live,in incredibly complex systems.,We have the human systems,of how we communicate and interrelate,and have our whole constructed society,,We have the industrial systems,nwhich is essentially the entire economy,,and then all of that has to operate,within the biggest system,,and, I would argue, the most important,,the ecosystem.,And you see, the choices that we make,as an individual,,but the choices that we make,in every single job that we have,,no matter how high or lownyou are in the pecking order,,has an impact on all of these systems.,And the thing is that we have to find ways,if we're actually going to address sustainability,of interlocking those complex systems,and making better choices that result,in net environmental gains.,What we need to do is we need to learn,to do more with less.,We have an increasing population,,and everybody likes their mobile phones,,especially in this situation here.,So we need to find innovative ways of solvingnsome of these problems that we face. 
 And that's where this process callednlife cycle thinking comes in.,So essentially, everything that is created,goes through a series of life cycle stages,,and we use this scientific process,called life cycle assessment,,or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,,in order to have a clearer picture of how,everything that we do in thentechnical part of those systems,affects the natural environment.,So we go all the way back,to the extraction of raw materials,,and then we look at manufacturing,,we look at packaging and transportation,,use, and end of life,,and at every single one of these stages,,the things that we do,have an interaction with the natural environment,,and we can monitor how that interaction,is actually affecting the systems and services,that make life on Earth possible.,And through doing this,,we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.,And we've busted a bunch of myths. 
 So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.,It's used a lot in marketing,,and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation,when we're talking about sustainability,,and that's the word biodegradability.,Now biodegradability is a material property;,it is not a definition of environmental benefits.,Allow me to explain.,When something natural,,something that's made from a cellulose fiber,like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,,or even a piece of paper,,when something natural ends up,in the natural environment, it degrades normally.,Its little carbon molecules that it stored up,as it was growing are naturally released,back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,,but this is a net situation.,Most natural things,don't actually end up in nature.,Most of the things, the waste that nwe produce, end up in landfill.,Landfill is a different environment.,In landfill, those same carbon molecules,degrade in a different way,,because a landfill is anaerobic.,It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.,Those same molecules, they become methane,,and methane is a 25 times more potent,greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.,So our old lettuces and products,that we have thrown out that are made,out of biodegradable materials,,if they end up in landfill,,contribute to climate change.,You see, there are facilities now,that can actually capture that methane,and generate power,,displacing the need for fossil fuel power,,but we need to be smart about this.,We need to identify how we can start to leverage,these types of things that are already happening,and start to design systems and services,that alleviate these problems.,Because right now, what people donis they turn around and they say,,"Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper,because that is better for the environment.",But if you're throwing it in the bin,,and your local landfill facility,is just a normal one,,then we're having what's called a double negative. 
 I'm a product designer by trade.,I then did social science.,And so I'm absolutely fascinated,by consumer goods and how the consumer goods,that we have kind of become immune to,that fill our lives,have an impact on the natural environment.,And these guys are, like, serial offenders,,and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room,has a refrigerator.,Now America has this amazing ability,to keep growing refrigerators.,In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot,on average, the standard size,of a refrigerator.,And the problem is, they're so big now,,it's easier for us to buy more food,that we can't eat or find.,I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator,that have been there for years, all right?,And so what happens is, we waste more food.,And as I was just explaining,nfood waste is a problem.,In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent,of food purchased for the home is wasted.,Half of the world's produced food is wasted.,That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.,It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.,And I blame it on the refrigerator,,well, especially in Western cultures,,because it makes it easier.,I mean, there's a lot of complexnsystems going on here.,I don't want to make it so simplistic. 
 But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,,and one of the features of it,is the crisper drawer.,You all got crisper drawers?,The drawer that you put your lettuces in?,Lettuces have a habit of going soggy,in the crisper drawers, don't they?,Yeah? Soggy lettuces?,In the U.K., this is such a problem,that there was a government report a few years ago,that actually said the second biggest offender,of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.,It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.,Okay? So this is a problem, people.,These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out,left, right and center because the crisper drawers,are not designed to actually keep things crisp.,Okay. You need a tight environment.,You need, like, an airless environment,to prevent the degrading thatnwould happen naturally.,But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer,with a slightly better seal.,Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.,Don't ever invite me over because I'll justnstart going through your refrigerator,and looking at all sorts of things like that.,But essentially, this is a big problem.,Because when we lose somethingnlike the lettuce from the system,,not only do we have that impact nI just explained at the end of life,,but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.,The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.,We've had to clear land.,We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,,fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.,All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce,get lost from the system,,which makes it a far bigger environmental impact,than the loss of the energy from the fridge.,So we need to design things like this far better,if we're going to start addressingnserious environmental problems.,We could start with the crisper drawer and the size.,For those of you in the room who do design fridges,,that would be great. 
 The problem is, imagine if we,actually started to reconsider nhow we designed things.,So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,,but we actually haven't really changed the design,of them that much since the 1950s.,A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,,cold boxes that we store stuff in.,So imagine if we actually really started,to identify these problems and use that,as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant,design solutions that will solve those problems.,This is design-led system change,,design dictating the way in which the system,can be far more sustainable.,Forty percent food waste is a major problem.,Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that. 
 Another item that I find fascinating,is the electric tea kettle,,which I found out that,you don't do tea kettles innthis country, really, do you?,But that's really big in the U.K.,Ninety-seven percent of households,in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.,So they're very popular.,And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm,or a designer, and they were designing one of these,,and they wanted to do it eco,,they'd usually ask me two things.,They'd say, "Leyla, how do Inmake it technically efficient?",Because obviously energy'sna problem with this product.,Or, "How do I make it green materials?,How do I make the materials green,in the manufacturing?",Would you ask me those questions?,They seem logical, right? Yeah.,Well I'd say, "You're looking at the wrong problems.",Because the problem is with use.,It's with how people use the product.,Sixty-five percent of Brits,admit to over-filling their kettle,when they only need one cup of tea.,All of this extra water that's being boiled,requires energy, and it's been calculated,that in one day of extra energy use,from boiling kettles,is enough to light all of the streetlights,in England for a night. 
 But this is the thing.,This is what I call a product-person failure.,But we've got a product-system failurengoing on with these little guys,,and they're so ubiquitous, you ndon't even notice they're there.,And this guy over here, though, he does.nHe's named Simon.,Simon works for the nationalnelectricity company in the U.K.,He has a very important job of monitoring,all of the electricity coming into the system,to make sure there is enough,so it powers everybody's homes.,He's also watching television.,The reason is because there's a unique,phenomenon that happens in the U.K.,the moment that very popular TV shows end.,The minute the ad break comes on,,this man has to rush,to buy nuclear power from France,,because everybody turns their kettles on,at the same time.,(Laughter),1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.,So imagine if you designed kettles,,you actually found a way tonsolve these system failures,,because this is a huge amount of pressure,on the system,,just because the product hasn'tnthought about the problem,that it's going to have when it exists in the world.,Now, I looked at a number ofnkettles available on the market,,and found the minimum fill lines,,so the little piece of information that tells you,how much you need to put in there,,was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water,just to make one cup of tea.,So this kettle here is an example of one where,it actually has two reservoirs.,One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.,The user actually has to push that button,to get their hot water boiled,,which means, because we're all lazy,,you only fill exactly what you need.,And this is what I call behavior-changing products:,products, systems or services,that intervene and solve these problems up front. 
 Now, this is a technology arena,,so obviously these things are quite popular,,but I think if we're going to keep,designing, buying and using and throwing out,these kinds of products at the rate we currently do,,which is astronomically high,,there are seven billion people,who live in the world right now.,There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions,as of last year.,Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones,roll off production lines,,and some companies report their production rate,as being greater than the human birth rate.,One hundred fifty-two million phones nwere thrown out in the U.S. last year;,only 11 percent were recycled.,I'm from Australia. We have anpopulation of 22 million -- don't laugh --,and it's been reported that 22 million phones,are in people's drawers.,We need to find ways of solvingnthe problems around this,,because these things are so complicated.,They have so much locked up inside them.,Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now,to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones,than it is out of a ton of gold ore?,There's a number of highly complex and valuable,materials embodied inside these things,,so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,,because this is otherwise what happens.,This is a community in Ghana,,and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste,is reported by the U.N.,as being up to 50 million tons trafficked.,This is how they get the gold,and the other valuable materials out.,They burn the electronic waste,in open spaces.,These are communities, and thisnis happening all over the world.,And because we don't see the ramifications,of the choices that we make as designers,,as businesspeople, as consumers,,then these kinds of externalities happen,,and these are people's lives.,So we need to find smarter, more systems-based,,innovative solutions to these problems,,if we're going to start to livensustainably within this world. 
 So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,,your new one because you replaced your old one --,after 15 to 18 months is the average time,that people replace their phones, by the way —,so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient,mobile phone replacing, then we should,be looking at closing the loop on these systems.,The people who produce these phones,,and some of which I'm surenare in the room right now,,could potentially look at doing whatnwe call closed-loop systems,,or product system services,,so identifying that there is a market demand,and that market demand's not going to go anywhere,,so you design the product to solve the problem.,Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting.,We heard some of those kinds of strategies,being used in the Tesla Motors car today.,These kinds of approaches are not hard,,but understanding the system,and then looking for viable, market-driven,consumer demand alternatives,is how we can start radically altering,the sustainability agenda,,because I hate to break it to you all:,Consumption is the biggest problem.,But design is one of the best solutions. 
 These kinds of products are everywhere.,By identifying alternative ways of doing things,,we can actually start to innovate,,and I say actually start to innovate.,I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.,But in the regards to using sustainability,as a parameter, as a criteria,for fueling systems-based solutions,,because as I've just demonstratednwith these simple products,,they're participating in these major problems.,So we need to look across the entire life,of the things that we do. 
 If you just had paper or plastic --,obviously reusable is far more beneficial --,then the paper is worse,,and the paper is worse because it weighs,four to 10 times more than the plastic,,and when we actually compare,nfrom a life cycle perspective,,a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,,the paper is far better,,but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag,to carry your groceries home is not ndone with a kilo of each material.,It's done with a very small amount of plastic,and quite a lot more paper.,Because functionality defines environmental impact,,and I said earlier that the designersnalways ask me for the eco-materials.,I say, there's only a few materialsnthat you should completely avoid.,The rest of them, it's all about application,,and at the end of the day, everythingnwe design and produce in the economy,or buy as consumers is done so for function.,We want something, therefore we buy it.,So breaking things back down and delivering,smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions,that take into consideration the entire system,and the entire life of the thing, everything,,all the way back to the extractionnthrough to the end of life,,we can start to actually findnreally innovative solutions. 
 And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing,that a designer said to me recently nwho I work with, a senior designer.,I said, "How come you're not doing nsustainability? I know you know this.",And he said, "Well, recently I pitchedna sustainability project to a client,,and turned and he said to me,,'I know it's going to cost less,,I know it's going to sell more,,but we're not pioneers, becausenpioneers have arrows in their backs.'" 
 I think we've got a roomful of pioneers,,and I hope there are far more pioneers out there,nbecause we need to solve these problems. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I was trained to become a gymnast,for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.,When I was in the first grade, the government,wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,,all expenses paid.,But my tiger mother said, "No.",My parents wanted me to become,an engineer like them.,After surviving the Cultural Revolution,,they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:,a safe and well-paid job.,It is not important if I like the job or not. 
 But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.,That is me playing my imaginary piano.,An opera singer must start training young,to learn acrobatics,,so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.,I even wrote to the school principal,and the host of a radio show.,But no adults liked the idea.,No adults believed I was serious.,Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,,just as powerless as I was.,So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.,My dream would never come true.,I was afraid that for the rest of my life,some second-class happiness,would be the best I could hope for. 
 But that's so unfair.,So I was determined to find another calling.,Nobody around to teach me? Fine.,I turned to books. 
 I satisfied my hunger for parental advice,from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"] 
 I found my role model of an independent woman,when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"] 
 And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"] 
 And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. 
 ["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin] 
 I came to the U.S. in 1995,,so which books did I read here first?,Books banned in China, of course.,"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.,That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.,The Bible is interesting, but strange.,(Laughter),That's a topic for a different day.,But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:,"You shall honor your father and mother.","Honor," I said. "That's so different,,and better, than obey.",So it becomes my tool to climb out,of this Confucian guilt trap,and to restart my relationship with my parents. 
 Encountering a new culture also started my habit,of comparative reading.,It offers many insights.,For example, I found this map out of place at first,because this is what Chinese students grew up with.,It had never occurred to me,,China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.,A map actually carries somebody's view.,Comparative reading actually is nothing new.,It's a standard practice in the academic world.,There are even research fields,such as comparative religion and comparative literature. 
 Compare and contrast gives scholars,a more complete understanding of a topic.,So I thought, well, if comparative reading,works for research, why not do it in daily life too?,So I started reading books in pairs.,So they can be about people --,["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --,who are involved in the same event,,or friends with shared experiences.,["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder],I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter),[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --,or similar stories from different cultures,,as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell],For example, both the Christ and the Buddha,went through three temptations.,For the Christ, the temptations,are economic, political and spiritual.,For the Buddha, they are all psychological:,lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. 
 So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun,to read your favorite books in two languages.,["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts],Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.,For example, it's through translation that I realized,"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!,"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.,(Laughter) 
 Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people,of the past and the present.,I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.,Having a dream shattered really is nothing,compared to what many others have suffered.,I have come to believe that coming true,is not the only purpose of a dream.,Its most important purpose is to get us in touch,with where dreams come from,,where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.,Even a shattered dream can do that for you. 
 So because of books, I'm here today,,happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,,most of the time.,So may books be always with you. 
 Thank you.

 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,,I try to question the inter-canceling relationship,between our civilization and its development.,Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question,the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship,between our civilization and its development. 
 LB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.,And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked,before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.,I also want to use this work to let more people,pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.,In the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a,protesting, reflective,and uncompromising spirit.,When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method,to better protect myself,and to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter) 
 After finishing this series of protests,,I started questioning why my fate was like this,,and I realized that it's not just me --,all Chinese are as confused as I am.,As you can see, these works,are about family planning, election in accordance with the law,and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress. 
 This work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").,"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".,It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.,From 1998 to 2000,,21.37 million people,lost their jobs in China.,The six people in the photo,are Xia Gang workers.,I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.,On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:,"The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party.",For half a month,I looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.,We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here,are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible. 
 This piece is called The Studio.,This spring,,I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris,to shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 --,I picked the news photos of the day.,One is about the war in the Middle East,,and another one is about a public demonstration in France.,I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions. 
 This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.,Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. 
 (Applause) 
 LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,,but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.,So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.,But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.,Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,,but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.,So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.,But it doesn't work, my eyes are still small. 
 LB: This one is about 9/11 memories. 
 This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River. 
 Kenny Scharf's graffiti.,(Laughter) 
 This is Venice, Italy.,Because global temperatures rise,,the sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.,This is the ancient city of Pompeii.,Interpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.,LB: This is the Borghese Gallery,in Rome. 
 When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.,For instance, why would I make myself invisible?,What will making myself invisible here cause people to think? 
 This one is called Instant Noodles.,Interpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter),LB: Since August 2012,,harmful phosphors have been found,in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.,These phosphors can even cause cancer.,To create this artwork,,I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups,and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.,And my task is to stand there, trying to be still,,setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant,and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body,on the front of my body. If the background is simple,,I usually have to stand for three to four hours.,The background of this piece is more complex,,so I need three to four days in advance for preparation.,This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.,There is no Photoshop involved.,Interpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.,There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter) 
 LB: These works are on China's cultural memories. 
 And this one,,this is about food safety in China.,Unsafe food can harm people's health,,and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter),The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,,in different countries and at different times. 
 I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.,If an artwork is to touch someone,,it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.,And the repeated struggles in life create artwork,,no matter in what form. 
 (Music) 
 That's all I want to say. 
 Thank you. (Applause)I'm here to show you,how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.,You're about to experience a new, available,and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink,how we waterproof our lives. 
 What I have here is a cinder block,that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray,that can be applied to almost any material.,It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,,and when you apply it to any material,,it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.,So this is a cinder block, uncoated,,and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.,Not anymore.,Porous, nonporous. 
 So what's superhydrophobic?,Superhydrophobic is how we measure,a drop of water on a surface.,The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,,and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.,A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump,to about 90 degrees.,A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.,But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,,and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.,So as part of the demonstration,,what I have is a pair of gloves,,and we've coated one of the gloves,with the nanotechnology coating,,and let's see if you can tell which one,,and I'll give you a hint. 
 Did you guess the one that was dry? 
 When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,,what's occurred is that we're able to now,look at atoms and molecules and actually control them,for great benefits.,And we're talking really small here.,The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,,and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,,and to put some scale to that,,if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,,and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,,you'd be the width of a human hair.,So very small, but very useful. 
 And it's not just water that this works with.,It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,,water-based paint,,mud,,and also some refined oils as well. 
 You can see the difference. 
 Moving onto the next demonstration,,we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,,we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,,and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,,and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass,like you'd normally think it would,,except when it hits the coating, it stops,,and I can't even coax it to leave.,It's that afraid of the water. 
 (Applause) 
 So what's going on here? What's happening?,Well, the surface of the spray coating,is actually filled with nanoparticles,that form a very rough and craggly surface.,You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.,And it has billions of interstitial spaces,,and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,,reach up and grab the air molecules,,and cover the surface with air.,It's an umbrella of air all across it,,and that layer of air is what the water hits,,the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.,So if I put this inside this water here,,you can see a silver reflective coating around it,,and that silver reflective coating,is the layer of air that's protecting the water,from touching the paddle, and it's dry. 
 So what are the applications?,I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.,Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,,"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this.",The applications in a general sense,could be anything that's anti-wetting.,We've certainly seen that today.,It could be anything that's anti-icing,,because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.,It could be anti-corrosion.,No water, no corrosion.,It could be anti-bacterial.,Without water, the bacteria won't survive.,And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well. 
 So imagine how something like this,could help revolutionize your field of work.,And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,,but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,,and think small.,(Applause),It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. 
 Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter) 
 [Two minutes later...] 
 He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.,It's happening!,(Applause)When I was in my 20s,,I saw my very first psychotherapy client.,I was a Ph.D. studentnin clinical psychology at Berkeley.,She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex. 
 Now Alex walked into her first sessionnwearing jeans and a big slouchy top,,and she droppednonto the couch in my office,and kicked off her flats,and told me she was therento talk about guy problems.,Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.,My classmate got an arsonistnfor her first client. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I got a twentysomethingnwho wanted to talk about boys.,This I thought I could handle.,But I didn't handle it.,With the funny storiesnthat Alex would bring to session,,it was easy for me just to nod my head,while we kicked the can down the road.,"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,,and as far as I could tell, she was right.,Work happened later,nmarriage happened later,,kids happened later,neven death happened later.,Twentysomethings like Alex and Inhad nothing but time. 
 But before long, my supervisor pushed mento push Alex about her love life.,I pushed back.,I said, "Sure, she's dating down,,she's sleeping with a knucklehead,,but it's not like she's goingnto marry the guy.",And then my supervisor said,,"Not yet, but she might marrynthe next one.,Besides, the best timento work on Alex's marriage,is before she has one." 
 That's what psychologistsncall an "Aha!" moment.,That was the moment I realized,n30 is not the new 20.,Yes, people settle down laternthan they used to,,but that didn't make Alex's 20sna developmental downtime.,That made Alex's 20sna developmental sweet spot,,and we were sitting there, blowing it.,That was when I realizednthat this sort of benign neglect,was a real problem,nand it had real consequences,,not just for Alex and her love life,but for the careersnand the families and the futures,of twentysomethings everywhere. 
 There are 50 million twentysomethingsnin the United States right now.,We're talking about 15 percentnof the population,,or 100 percent if you consider,that no one's getting through adulthoodnwithout going through their 20s first. 
 (Laughter) 
 Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.,I really want to seensome twentysomethings here.,Oh, yay! You are all awesome.,If you work with twentysomethings,nyou love a twentysomething,,you're losing sleepnover twentysomethings, I want to see —,Okay. Awesome,ntwentysomethings really matter. 
 So, I specialize in twentysomethingsnbecause I believe,that every single one of thosen50 million twentysomethings,deserves to know what psychologists,,sociologists, neurologistsnand fertility specialists,already know:,that claiming your 20snis one of the simplest,,yet most transformative, things you can do,for work, for love, for your happiness,,maybe even for the world. 
 This is not my opinion.,These are the facts.,We know that 80 percentnof life's most defining moments,take place by age 35.,That means that eight out of 10,of the decisions and experiencesnand "Aha!" moments,that make your life what it is,will have happened by your mid-30s.,People who are over 40, don't panic.,This crowd is going to be fine, I think.,We know that the firstn10 years of a career,has an exponential impactnon how much money you're going to earn.,We know that more than half of Americans,are married or are living with or datingntheir future partner by 30.,We know that the brain caps off,its second and lastngrowth spurt in your 20s,as it rewires itself for adulthood,,which means that whatever it is you wantnto change about yourself,,now is the time to change it.,We know that personalitynchanges more during your 20s,than at any other time in life,,and we know that female fertilitynpeaks at age 28,,and things get tricky after age 35.,So your 20s are the timento educate yourself,about your body and your options. 
 So when we think about child development,,we all know that the firstnfive years are a critical period,for language and attachment in the brain.,It's a time when your ordinary,nday-to-day life,has an inordinate impactnon who you will become.,But what we hear less aboutnis that there's such a thing,as adult development,,and our 20s are that critical periodnof adult development. 
 But this isn't whatntwentysomethings are hearing.,Newspapers talk about the changingntimetable of adulthood.,Researchers call the 20snan extended adolescence.,Journalists coin silly nicknamesnfor twentysomethings,like "twixters" and "kidults." 
 (Laughing) It's true! 
 As a culture, we have trivialized,what is actuallynthe defining decade of adulthood. 
 Leonard Bernstein saidnthat to achieve great things,,you need a plan and not quite enough time. 
 (Laughing) Isn't that true? 
 So what do you think happens,when you pat a twentysomethingnon the head and you say,,"You have 10 extra yearsnto start your life"?,Nothing happens.,You have robbed that personnof his urgency and ambition,,and absolutely nothing happens. 
 And then every day, smart,ninteresting twentysomethings,like you or like your sons and daughters,come into my officenand say things like this:,"I know my boyfriend's no good for me,,but this relationship doesn't count.nI'm just killing time.",Or they say, "Everybody saysnas long as I get started,on a career by the timenI'm 30, I'll be fine." 
 But then it starts to sound like this:,"My 20s are almost over,nand I have nothing to show for myself.,I had a better résumé the daynafter I graduated from college.",And then it starts to sound like this:,"Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.,Everybody was running aroundnand having fun,,but then sometime around 30nit was like the music turned off,and everybody started sitting down.,I didn't want to benthe only one left standing up,,so sometimes I think I married my husband,because he was the closestnchair to me at 30." 
 Where are the twentysomethings here?,Do not do that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, now that sounds a little flip,nbut make no mistake,,the stakes are very high.,When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,,there is enormous thirtysomething pressure,to jump-start a career,npick a city, partner up,,and have two or three kidsnin a much shorter period of time.,Many of these things are incompatible,,and as research is just starting to show,,simply harder and more stressful to donall at once in our 30s. 
 The post-millennial midlife crisisnisn't buying a red sports car.,It's realizing you can't haventhat career you now want.,It's realizing you can't haventhat child you now want,,or you can't give your child a sibling.,Too many thirtysomethingsnand fortysomethings,look at themselves, and at me,nsitting across the room,,and say about their 20s,,"What was I doing? What was I thinking?",I want to change what twentysomethingsnare doing and thinking. 
 Here's a story about how that can go.,It's a story about a woman named Emma.,At 25, Emma came to my office,because she was, in her words,nhaving an identity crisis.,She said she thought she mightnlike to work in art or entertainment,,but she hadn't decided yet,,so she'd spent the last few yearsnwaiting tables instead.,Because it was cheaper,nshe lived with a boyfriend,who displayed his tempernmore than his ambition.,And as hard as her 20s were,,her early life had been even harder.,She often cried in our sessions,,but then would collect herself by saying,,"You can't pick your family,nbut you can pick your friends." 
 Well one day, Emma comes innand she hangs her head in her lap,,and she sobbed for most of the hour.,She'd just bought a new address book,,and she'd spent the morningnfilling in her many contacts,,but then she'd been leftnstaring at that empty blank,that comes after the words,"In case of emergency, please call ...",She was nearly hystericalnwhen she looked at me and said,,"Who's going to be there for menif I get in a car wreck?,Who's going to take care of menif I have cancer?" 
 Now in that moment,nit took everything I had,not to say, "I will.",But what Emma needed wasn't some therapistnwho really, really cared.,Emma needed a better life,nand I knew this was her chance.,I had learned too muchnsince I first worked with Alex,to just sit therenwhile Emma's defining decade,went parading by. 
 So over the next weeks and months,,I told Emma three things,that every twentysomething,nmale or female,,deserves to hear. 
 First, I told Emma to forgetnabout having an identity crisis,and get some identity capital.,By "get identity capital,",I mean do somethingnthat adds value to who you are.,Do something that's an investment,in who you might want to be next.,I didn't know the future of Emma's career,,and no one knows the future of work,,but I do know this:,Identity capital begets identity capital.,So now is the timenfor that cross-country job,,that internship, that startupnyou want to try.,I'm not discountingntwentysomething exploration here,,but I am discounting explorationnthat's not supposed to count,,which, by the way, is not exploration.,That's procrastination.,I told Emma to explorenwork and make it count. 
 Second, I told Emmanthat the urban tribe is overrated.,Best friends are greatnfor giving rides to the airport,,but twentysomethings who huddle togethernwith like-minded peers,limit who they know,,what they know, how they think,,how they speak, and where they work.,That new piece of capital,nthat new person to date,almost always comesnfrom outside the inner circle.,New things comenfrom what are called our weak ties,,our friends of friends of friends.,So yes, half of twentysomethingsnare un- or under-employed.,But half aren't,,and weak ties are hownyou get yourself into that group.,Half of new jobs are never posted,,so reaching out to your neighbor's bossnis how you get that unposted job.,It's not cheating. It's the sciencenof how information spreads. 
 Last but not least, Emma believed,that you can't pick your family,nbut you can pick your friends.,Now this was true for her growing up,,but as a twentysomething,nsoon Emma would pick her family,when she partnered with someonenand created a family of her own.,I told Emma the timento start picking your family is now. 
 Now you may be thinking that 30nis actually a better time to settle down,than 20, or even 25,,and I agree with you.,But grabbing whoever you're livingnwith or sleeping with,when everyone on Facebooknstarts walking down the aisle,is not progress.,The best time to work on your marriagenis before you have one,,and that means beingnas intentional with love,as you are with work.,Picking your familynis about consciously choosing,who and what you want,rather than just making it worknor killing time,with whoever happens to be choosing you. 
 So what happened to Emma?,Well, we went through that address book,,and she found an old roommate's cousin,who worked at an art museumnin another state.,That weak tie helped her get a job there.,That job offer gave her the reasonnto leave that live-in boyfriend.,Now, five years later, she's a specialnevents planner for museums.,She's married to a mannshe mindfully chose.,She loves her new career,nshe loves her new family,,and she sent me a card that said,,"Now the emergency contact blanks,don't seem big enough." 
 Now Emma's story made that sound easy,,but that's what I love about workingnwith twentysomethings.,They are so easy to help.,Twentysomethings are like airplanesnjust leaving LAX,,bound for somewhere west.,Right after takeoff,na slight change in course,is the difference between landingnin Alaska or Fiji.,Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,,one good conversation, one good break,,one good TED Talk,ncan have an enormous effect,across years and even generations to come. 
 So here's an idea worth spreading,to every twentysomething you know.,It's as simple as what I learnednto say to Alex.,It's what I now have the privilege,of saying to twentysomethingsnlike Emma every single day:,Thirty is not the new 20,nso claim your adulthood,,get some identity capital,nuse your weak ties,,pick your family.,Don't be defined by what you didn't know,or didn't do.,You're deciding your life right now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I live in South Central.,This is South Central:,liquor stores,,fast food,,vacant lots. 
 So the city planners, they get together and they figure,they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,,so they change it to South Los Angeles,,like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.,This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter),Liquor stores,,fast food,,vacant lots. 
 Just like 26.5 million other Americans,,I live in a food desert,,South Central Los Angeles,,home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.,Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.,People are dying from curable diseases,in South Central Los Angeles.,For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood,is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,,which is probably eight, 10 miles away. 
 I got tired of seeing this happening.,And I was wondering, how would you feel,if you had no access to healthy food,,if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects,that the present food system has on your neighborhood?,I see wheelchairs bought and sold,like used cars.,I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.,And I figured, this has to stop.,So I figured that the problem is the solution.,Food is the problem and food is the solution.,Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip,to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. 
 So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.,It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.,It's 150 feet by 10 feet.,Thing is, it's owned by the city.,But you have to maintain it.,So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,,since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it.",And this is how I decided to maintain it. 
 So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together,and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,,you know, the whole nine, vegetables.,What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,,where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,,from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,,and everything we do is free.,And the garden, it was beautiful. 
 And then somebody complained.,The city came down on me,,and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,,which this citation was turning into a warrant.,And I'm like, "Come on, really?,A warrant for planting food on a piece of land,that you could care less about?" (Laughter),And I was like, "Cool. Bring it.",Because this time it wasn't coming up.,So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it,and talked to the councilman,,and one of the Green Grounds members,,they put up a petition on Change.org,,and with 900 signatures, we were a success.,We had a victory on our hands.,My councilman even called in and said how they endorse,and love what we're doing.,I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?,L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.,They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.,That's 20 Central Parks.,That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.,Why in the hell would they not okay this?,Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.,When one dollar's worth of green beans,will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.,It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.,Growing your own food is like printing your own money. 
 (Applause) 
 See, I have a legacy in South Central.,I grew up there. I raised my sons there.,And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality,that was manufactured for me by some other people,,and I'm manufacturing my own reality. 
 See, I'm an artist.,Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.,Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,,me, I beautify lawns, parkways.,I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,,and the plants and the trees,,that's my embellishment for that cloth.,You'd be surprised what the soil could do,if you let it be your canvas.,You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is,and how it affects people. 
 So what happened?,I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,,a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.,To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.,We are the soil.,You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.,Gardening is the most therapeutic,and defiant act you can do,,especially in the inner city.,Plus you get strawberries. 
 (Laughter) 
 I remember this time,,there was this mother and a daughter came,,it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,,and I came out and they looked so ashamed.,So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,,and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.,This is on the street for a reason.,It made me feel ashamed to see people,that were this close to me that were hungry,,and this only reinforced why I do this,,and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid,people are going to steal your food?",And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.,That's why it's on the street.,That's the whole idea.,I want them to take it, but at the same time,,I want them to take back their health." 
 There's another time when I put,a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.,These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.,It was cool, and they just shared the stories,about how this affected them and how,they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,,and it was just cool to see how this changed them,,if it was only for that one moment. 
 So Green Grounds has gone on to plant,maybe 20 gardens.,We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins,and participate, and it's all volunteers.,If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.,(Laughter),If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause),But when none of this is presented to them,,if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,,they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. 
 I see young people,and they want to work,,but they're in this thing where they're caught up --,I see kids of color and they're just on this track,that's designed for them,,that leads them to nowhere.,So with gardening, I see an opportunity,where we can train these kids,to take over their communities,,to have a sustainable life.,And when we do this, who knows?,We might produce the next George Washington Carver.,but if we don't change the composition of the soil,,we will never do this. 
 Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.,I want to plant a whole block of gardens,where people can share in the food in the same block.,I want to take shipping containers,and turn them into healthy cafes.,Now don't get me wrong.,I'm not talking about no free shit,,because free is not sustainable.,The funny thing about sustainability,,you have to sustain it.,(Laughter) (Applause),What I'm talking about is putting people to work,,and getting kids off the street, and letting them know,the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,,opening farmer's markets. 
 So what I want to do here,,we gotta make this sexy.,So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,,gangstas, gangsta gardeners.,We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.,If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.,Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?,And let that be your weapon of choice. 
 (Applause) 
 So basically, if you want to meet with me,,you know, if you want to meet,,don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs,and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --,where you talk about doing some shit.,If you want to meet with me, come to the garden,with your shovel so we can plant some shit. 
 Peace. Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)I moved back home 15 years ago,after a 20-year stay in the United States,,and Africa called me back.,And I founded my country's first,graphic design and new media college.,And I called it the ZimbabwenInstitute of Vigital Arts.,The idea, the dream, was reallynfor a sort of Bauhaus,sort of school where newnideas were interrogated,and investigated,,the creation of a new visual language,based on the African creative heritage.,We offer a two-year diploma,to talented students who havensuccessfully completed,their high school education.,And typography's a very importantnpart of the curriculum,and we encourage our studentsnto look inward for influence.,Here's a poster designednby one of the students,under the theme "Education is a right.",Some logos designed by my students.,Africa has had a longntradition of writing,,but this is not such a well-known fact,,and I wrote the book "AfrikannAlphabets" to address that.,The different types of writing in Africa,,first was proto-writing,,as illustrated by Nsibidi,,which is the writingnsystem of a secret society,of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.,So it's a special-interest writing system.,The Akan of people of Ghananand [Cote d'Ivoire],developed Adinkra symbolsnsome 400 years ago,,and these are proverbs,nhistorical sayings,,objects, animals, plants,,and my favorite Adinkra system,is the first one at the top on the left.,It's called Sankofa.,It means, "Return and getnit." Learn from the past.,This pictograph by the Jokwenpeople of Angola,tells the storynof the creation of the world.,At the top is God,nat the bottom is man, mankind,,and on the left is the sun,non the right is the moon.,All the paths lead to and from God.,These secret societiesnof the Yoruba, Kongo,and Palo religions,in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,,developed this intricate writing system,which is alive and wellntoday in the New World,in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.,In the rainforests of the DemocraticnRepublic of Congo,,in the Ituri society,,the men pound out a clothnout of a special tree,,and the women, who are alsonthe praise singers,,paint interweaving patterns,that are the same in structure,as the polyphonic structuresnthat they use in their singing --,a sort of a musical score, if you may.,In South Africa, Ndebele women,use these symbols and otherngeometric patterns,to paint their homes in bright colors,,and the Zulu women use the symbols,in the beads that they weave,into bracelets and necklaces.,Ethiopia has had the longestntradition of writing,,with the Ethiopic scriptnthat was developed,in the fourth century A.D.,and is used to write Amharic,,which is spoken by over 24 million people.,King Ibrahim Njoya of the BamumnKingdom of Cameroon,developed Shü-mom at the age of 25.,Shü-mom is a writing system.,It's a syllabary. It's notnexactly an alphabet.,And here we seenthree stages of development,that it went through in 30 years.,The Vai people of Liberia hadna long tradition of literacy,before their first contactnwith Europeans in the 1800s.,It's a syllabary and readsnfrom left to right.,Next door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende,also developed a syllabary,,but theirs reads from right to left.,Africa has had a long tradition of design,,a well-defined design sensibility,,but the problem in Africa has been that,,especially today, designers in Africa,struggle with all forms of design,because they are more apt to look outward,for influence and inspiration.,The creative spirit in Africa,nthe creative tradition,,is as potent as it has always been,,if only designers could look within.,This Ethiopic cross illustrates,what Dr. Ron Eglash has established:,that Africa has a lotnto contribute to computing,and mathematics through their intuitivengrasp of fractals.,Africans of antiquityncreated civilization,,and their monuments,nwhich still stand today,,are a true testimony of their greatness.,Most probably,none of humanity's greatest achievements,is the invention of the alphabet,,and that has been attributednto Mesopotamia,with their inventionnof cuneiform in 1600 BC,,followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,,and that story has been castnin stone as historical fact.,That is, until 1998,,when one Yale professornJohn Coleman Darnell,discovered these inscriptionsnin the Thebes desert,on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,,and these have been datednat between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,,centuries before Mesopotamia.,Called Wadi el-Hol,because of the placenthat they were discovered,,these inscriptions --nresearch is still going on,,a few of them have been deciphered,,but there is consensus among scholars,that this is reallynhumanity's first alphabet.,Over here, you see a paleographic chart,that shows what hasnbeen deciphered so far,,starting with the letternA, "ālep," at the top,,and "bêt," in the middle, and so forth.,It is time that studentsnof design in Africa,read the works of titansnlike Cheikh Anta Diop,,Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop,,whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated,by this discovery.,The last word goesnto the great Jamaican leader,Marcus Mosiah Garvey,and the Akan people of Ghana,with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa,,which encourages us to go to the past,so as to inform our present,and build on a futurenfor us and our children.,It is also time that designers in Africa,stop looking outside.,They've been lookingnoutward for a long time,,yet what they were looking for,has been right therenwithin grasp, right within them.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)There's so many of you. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was a kid,,I hid my heart under the bed,nbecause my mother said,,"If you're not careful,nsomeday someone's going to break it.",Take it from me: Under the bednis not a good hiding spot.,I know because I've beennshot down so many times,,I get altitude sicknessnjust from standing up for myself.,But that's what we were told.,"Stand up for yourself.",And that's hard to donif you don't know who you are.,We were expected to define ourselvesnat such an early age,,and if we didn't do it,nothers did it for us.,Geek. Fatty.,Slut. Fag. 
 And at the same time we werenbeing told what we were,,we were being asked,,"What do you want to be when you grow up?",I always thoughtnthat was an unfair question.,It presupposes that we can't benwhat we already are.,We were kids. 
 When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.,I wanted a registerednretirement savings plan,that would keep me in candynlong enough to make old age sweet. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.,Now, not so much. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was eight,nI wanted to be a marine biologist.,When I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,",and thought to myself, "No, thank you." 
 (Laughter) 
 And when I was 10,,I was told that my parents leftnbecause they didn't want me.,When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.,When I was 12, I wanted to die.nWhen I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.,When I was 14, I was askednto seriously consider a career path. 
 I said, "I'd like to be a writer." 
 And they said,n"Choose something realistic." 
 So I said, "Professional wrestler." 
 And they said, "Don't be stupid." 
 See, they asked me what I wanted to be,,then told me what not to be. 
 And I wasn't the only one.,We were being toldnthat we somehow must become,what we are not, sacrificing what we are,to inherit the masqueradenof what we will be.,I was being told to accept the identitynthat others will give me. 
 And I wondered, what madenmy dreams so easy to dismiss?,Granted, my dreams are shy,,because they're Canadian. 
 (Laughter) 
 My dreams are self-consciousnand overly apologetic.,They're standing alonenat the high school dance,,and they've never been kissed.,See, my dreams got called names too.,Silly. Foolish.,Impossible.,But I kept dreaming.,I was going to be a wrestler.nI had it all figured out.,I was going to be The Garbage Man. 
 (Laughter) 
 My finishing move was goingnto be The Trash Compactor.,My saying was going to be,n"I'm taking out the trash!" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And then this guy,nDuke "The Dumpster" Droese,,stole my entire shtick. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was crushed,,as if by a trash compactor. 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought to myself,n"What now? Where do I turn?" 
 Poetry. 
 (Laughter) 
 Like a boomerang,nthe thing I loved came back to me.,One of the first lines of poetrynI can remember writing,was in response to a worldnthat demanded I hate myself.,From age 15 to 18, I hated myself,for becoming the thing that I loathed:,a bully. 
 When I was 19, I wrote,,"I will love myselfndespite the ease with which,I lean toward the opposite." 
 Standing up for yourselfndoesn't have to mean,embracing violence. 
 When I was a kid,,I traded in homeworknassignments for friendship,,then gave each friend a late slipnfor never showing up on time,,and in most cases, not at all.,I gave myself a hall passnto get through each broken promise.,And I remember this plan,nborn out of frustration,from a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,",then pointed at my tummy and said,n"Too many picnic baskets.",Turns out it's not that hardnto trick someone,,and one day before class, I said,,"Yeah, you can copy my homework,",and I gave him all the wrong answersnthat I'd written down the night before.,He got his paper backnexpecting a near-perfect score,,and couldn't believe it when he lookednacross the room at me and held up a zero.,I knew I didn't have to hold upnmy paper of 28 out of 30,,but my satisfaction was completenwhen he looked at me, puzzled,,and I thought to myself, "Smarternthan the average bear, motherfucker." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This is who I am.,This is how I stand up for myself. 
 When I was a kid,,I used to think that pork chopsnand karate chops were the same thing.,I thought they were both pork chops.,My grandmother thought it was cute,,and because they were my favorite,nshe let me keep doing it.,Not really a big deal.,One day, before I realized fat kidsnare not designed to climb trees,,I fell out of a treenand bruised the right side of my body.,I didn't want to tell my grandmother,because I was scared I'd get in trouble,for playing somewherenI shouldn't have been.,The gym teacher noticed the bruise,nand I got sent to the principal's office.,From there, I was sent to anothernsmall room with a really nice lady,who asked me all kinds of questionsnabout my life at home.,I saw no reason to lie.,As far as I was concerned,nlife was pretty good.,I told her, whenever I'm sad,nmy grandmother gives me karate chops. 
 (Laughter) 
 This led to a full-scale investigation,,and I was removednfrom the house for three days,,until they finally decidednto ask how I got the bruises.,News of this silly little storynquickly spread through the school,,and I earned my first nickname:,Porkchop.,To this day,,I hate pork chops. 
 I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,,surrounded by peoplenwho used to say that rhyme,about sticks and stones,,as if broken bones hurt morenthan the names we got called,,and we got called them all.,So we grew up believingnno one would ever fall in love with us,,that we'd be lonely forever,,that we'd never meet someonento make us feel like the sun,was something they builtnfor us in their toolshed.,So broken heartstrings bled the blues,,and we tried to empty ourselvesnso we'd feel nothing.,Don't tell me that hurtsnless than a broken bone,,that an ingrown lifenis something surgeons can cut away,,that there's no waynfor it to metastasize; it does. 
 She was eight years old,,our first day of grade threenwhen she got called ugly.,We both got moved to the back of class,so we would stopngetting bombarded by spitballs.,But the school halls were a battleground.,We found ourselves outnumberednday after wretched day.,We used to stay inside for recess,nbecause outside was worse.,Outside, we'd havento rehearse running away,,or learn to stay still like statues,ngiving no clues that we were there.,In grade five, they tapedna sign to the front of her desk,that read, "Beware of dog." 
 To this day,,despite a loving husband,nshe doesn't think she's beautiful,,because of a birthmark that takes upna little less than half her face.,Kids used to say,n"She looks like a wrong answer,that someone tried to erase,nbut couldn't quite get the job done.",And they'll never understandnthat she's raising two kids,whose definition of beautynbegins with the word "Mom,",because they see her heartnbefore they see her skin,,because she's only evernalways been amazing. 
 He was a broken branch graftednonto a different family tree,,adopted,,not because his parents optednfor a different destiny.,He was three when he became a mixed drink,of one part left alonenand two parts tragedy,,started therapy in eighth grade,,had a personalitynmade up of tests and pills,,lived like the uphills were mountainsnand the downhills were cliffs,,four-fifths suicidal,na tidal wave of antidepressants,,and an adolescent being called "Popper,",one part because of the pills,,99 parts because of the cruelty.,He tried to kill himself in grade 10,when a kid who could stillngo home to Mom and Dad,had the audacity to tell him,n"Get over it.",As if depression is somethingnthat could be remedied,by any of the contentsnfound in a first-aid kit. 
 To this day, he is a stick of TNTnlit from both ends,,could describe to you in detailnthe way the sky bends,in the moment before it's about to fall,,and despite an army of friendsnwho all call him an inspiration,,he remains a conversation piecenbetween people who can't understand,sometimes being drug-freenhas less to do with addiction,and more to do with sanity. 
 We weren't the only kidsnwho grew up this way.,To this day, kids are stillnbeing called names.,The classics weren"Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz.",Seems like every schoolnhas an arsenal of names,getting updated every year.,And if a kid breaks in a schoolnand no one around chooses to hear,,do they make a sound?,Are they just background noisenfrom a soundtrack stuck on repeat,,when people say things like,n"Kids can be cruel.",Every school was a big top circus tent,,and the pecking ordernwent from acrobats to lion tamers,,from clowns to carnies,nall of these miles ahead of who we were.,We were freaks --,lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,,oddities jugglingndepression and loneliness,,playing solitaire, spin the bottle,,trying to kiss the woundednparts of ourselves and heal,,but at night, while the others slept,,we kept walking the tightrope.,It was practice, and yes, some of us fell. 
 But I want to tell them that all of this,is just debris,left over when we finally decide to smashnall the things we thought we used to be,,and if you can't see anythingnbeautiful about yourself,,get a better mirror, lookna little closer, stare a little longer,,because there's something inside younthat made you keep trying,despite everyone who told you to quit.,You built a cast around your broken heart,and signed it yourself, "They were wrong.",Because maybe you didn't belongnto a group or a clique.,Maybe they decided to pick you lastnfor basketball or everything.,Maybe you used to bring bruises and brokennteeth to show-and-tell, but never told,,because how can you hold your ground,if everyone around younwants to bury you beneath it?,You have to believe that they were wrong.,They have to be wrong.,Why else would we still be here? 
 We grew up learningnto cheer on the underdog,because we see ourselves in them.,We stem from a root planted in the belief,that we are not what we were called.,We are not abandoned cars stalled outnand sitting empty on some highway,,and if in some way we are, don't worry.,We only got out to walk and get gas.,We are graduating membersnfrom the class of We Made It,,not the faded echoes of voices crying out,,"Names will never hurt me.",Of course they did. 
 But our lives will only ever alwaysncontinue to be a balancing act,that has less to do with pain,and more to do with beauty. 
 (Applause)There is an ancient proverb that says,it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,,especially when there is no cat.,I find this a particularly apt description of science,and how science works --,bumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,,trying to figure out what shape this might be,,what that might be,,there are reports of a cat somewhere around,,they may not be reliable, they may be,,and so forth and so on. 
 Now I know this is different than the way most people,think about science.,Science, we generally are told,,is a very well-ordered mechanism for,understanding the world,,for gaining facts, for gaining data,,that it's rule-based,,that scientists use this thing called the scientific method,and we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now,,and the scientific method is a set of rules,for getting hard, cold facts out of the data. 
 I'd like to tell you that's not the case.,So there's the scientific method,,but what's really going on is this. (Laughter) 
 [The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around] 
 And it's going on kind of like that. 
 [... in the dark] (Laughter) 
 So what is the difference, then,,between the way I believe science is pursued,and the way it seems to be perceived?,So this difference first came to me in some ways,in my dual role at Columbia University,,where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience,where we try to figure out how the brain works.,We do this by studying the sense of smell,,the sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory,,it's a great pleasure and fascinating work,and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs,and think up cool experiments to understand how this,sense of smell works and how the brain might be working,,and, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating. 
 But at the same time, it's my responsibility,to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain,,and that's a big subject,,and it takes quite a while to organize that,,and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting,,but I have to say, it's not so exhilarating.,So what was the difference?,Well, the course I was and am teaching,is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. (Laughs),It's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts,,it uses this giant book called "Principles of Neural Science",by three famous neuroscientists.,This book comes in at 1,414 pages,,it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds.,Just to put that in some perspective,,that's the weight of two normal human brains. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I began to realize, by the end of this course,,that the students maybe were getting the idea,that we must know everything there is to know about the brain.,That's clearly not true.,And they must also have this idea, I suppose,,that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts,and stick them in these big books.,And that's not really the case either.,When I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over,and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues,,we never talk about what we know.,We talk about what we don't know.,We talk about what still has to get done,,what's so critical to get done in the lab.,Indeed, this was, I think, best said by Marie Curie,who said that one never notices what has been done,but only what remains to be done.,This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining,her second graduate degree, I should say. 
 I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie,,because I am convinced that that glow behind her,is not a photographic effect. (Laughter),That's the real thing.,It is true that her papers are, to this day,,stored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française,in a concrete room that's lead-lined,,and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks,,you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit,,so it's pretty scary business. 
 Nonetheless, this is what I think we were leaving out,of our courses,and leaving out of the interaction that we have,with the public as scientists, the what-remains-to-be-done.,This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting.,It is, if you will, the ignorance.,That's what was missing. 
 So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course,on ignorance,,something I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.,So I did start teaching this course on ignorance,,and it's been quite interesting,and I'd like to tell you to go to the website.,You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.,And it's been really quite an interesting time for me,to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk,about what it is they don't know. 
 Now I use this word "ignorance," of course,,to be at least in part intentionally provocative,,because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations,and I clearly don't mean any of those.,So I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference,to fact or reason or data.,The ignorant are clearly unenlightened, unaware,,uninformed, and present company today excepted,,often occupy elected offices, it seems to me.,That's another story, perhaps. 
 I mean a different kind of ignorance.,I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative,,a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge,,something that's just not there to be known,or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from,,the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up,in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell,,perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein,,who said, "Thoroughly conscious ignorance,is the prelude to every real advance in science.",I think it's a wonderful idea:,thoroughly conscious ignorance. 
 So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today,,but of course the first thing we have to clear up,is what are we going to do with all those facts?,So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate.,We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts,,this accumulation model of science, as many have called it,,and it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.,How can you ever know all of this?,And indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate.,In 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published.,There's about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate,,and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published.,Divide that by the number of minutes in a year,,and you wind up with three new papers per minute.,So I've been up here a little over 10 minutes,,I've already lost three papers.,I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read. 
 So what do we do about this? Well, the fact is,that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will.,We just don't worry about it, in a way.,The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff,to be a scientist. That's true.,But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist.,You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer,or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter.,But in science, knowing a lot of stuff is not the point.,Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get,to more ignorance.,So knowledge is a big subject, but I would say,ignorance is a bigger one. 
 So this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit,about, some of the models of science that we tend to use,,and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.,So one of them, a popular one, is that scientists,are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together,to reveal some grand scheme or another.,This is clearly not true. For one, with puzzles,,the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution.,We don't have any such guarantee.,Indeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I think the puzzle model doesn't work. 
 Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things,the way you unravel the peels of an onion.,So peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion,to get at some fundamental kernel of truth.,I don't think that's the way it works either.,Another one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea,,that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath,is where most of the iceberg is hidden.,But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts,that we can somehow or another get completed.,We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is,,or we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days,,but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right?,Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case.,I think what really happens in science,is a model more like the magic well,,where no matter how many buckets you take out,,there's always another bucket of water to be had,,or my particularly favorite one,,with the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond.,So if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond,,the important thing to realize is that our ignorance,,the circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.,So the knowledge generates ignorance.,This is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw.,This is actually part of a toast that he delivered,to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work,,in which he claims that science,just creates more questions than it answers.n["Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more."] 
 I find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right,,plus it's a kind of job security.,As it turns out, he kind of cribbed that,from the philosopher Immanuel Kant,who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea,of question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.,I love that term, "question propagation,",this idea of questions propagating out there. 
 So I'd say the model we want to take is not,that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together,and then we gain knowledge.,It's rather kind of the other way around, really.,What do we use this knowledge for?,What are we using this collection of facts for?,We're using it to make better ignorance,,to come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.,Because, you know, there's low-quality ignorance,and there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same.,Scientists argue about this all the time.,Sometimes we call them bull sessions.,Sometimes we call them grant proposals.,But nonetheless, it's what the argument is about.,It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know.,It's what makes a good question. 
 So how do we think about these questions?,I'm going to show you a graph that shows up,quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments.,This graph asks the relationship between what you know,and how much you know about it.,So what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course,,and how much you know about it can be anywhere,from a little to a lot.,So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.,Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest.,They're interested in almost everything.,Now you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education,,and you see they know a bit more,,but it's been narrowed somewhat.,And finally you get your Ph.D., where it turns out,you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing. (Laughter),What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that,because, of course, when it dips below the zero axis, there,,it gets into a negative area.,That's where you find people like me, I'm afraid. 
 So the important thing here is that this can all be changed.,This whole view can be changed,by just changing the label on the x-axis.,So instead of how much you know about it,,we could say, "What can you ask about it?",So yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist,,but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff,is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right?,Knowing a lot of stuff, the purpose is,to be able to ask lots of questions,,to be able to frame thoughtful, interesting questions,,because that's where the real work is. 
 Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions.,I'm a neuroscientist, so how would we come up,with a question in neuroscience?,Because it's not always quite so straightforward.,So, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does?,Well, one thing the brain does, it moves us around.,We walk around on two legs.,That seems kind of simple, somehow or another.,I mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age,walks around on two legs, right?,So that maybe is not that interesting.,So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.,How about the visual system?,There it is, the visual system.,I mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff.,Indeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists,who work on the visual system,,from the retina to the visual cortex,,in an attempt to understand not just the visual system,but to also understand how general principles,of how the brain might work.,But now here's the thing:,Our technology has actually been pretty good,at replicating what the visual system does.,We have TV, we have movies,,we have animation, we have photography,,we have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.,They work differently than our visual systems in some cases,,but nonetheless we've been pretty good at,making a technology work like our visual system.,Somehow or another, a hundred years of robotics,,you never saw a robot walk on two legs,,because robots don't walk on two legs,because it's not such an easy thing to do.,A hundred years of robotics,,and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other.,You ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over.,Turn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem.,So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?,What ought we to be studying?,Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs, or the motor system.,I'll give you an example from my own lab,,my own particularly smelly question,,since we work on the sense of smell.,But here's a diagram of five molecules,and sort of a chemical notation.,These are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules,up these two little holes in the front of your face,,you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.,If there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones,,but even if there's no rose there,,you'll have the memory of a molecule.,How do we turn molecules into perceptions?,What's the process by which that could happen?,Here's another example: two very simple molecules, again in this kind of chemical notation.,It might be easier to visualize them this way,,so the gray circles are carbon atoms, the white ones,are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms.,Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom,and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it,,and yet one of them, heptyl acetate,,has the distinct odor of a pear,,and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana.,So there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.,One is, how can a simple little molecule like that,create a perception in your brain that's so clear,as a pear or a banana?,And secondly, how the hell can we tell the difference,between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom?,I mean, that's remarkable to me,,clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.,And you don't even think about it, do you? 
 So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us,back to the ignorance and the idea of questions.,I like to quote because I think dead people,shouldn't be excluded from the conversation.,And I also think it's important to realize that,the conversation's been going on for a while, by the way.,So Erwin Schrodinger, a great quantum physicist,and, I think, philosopher, points out how you have to,"abide by ignorance for an indefinite period" of time.,And it's this abiding by ignorance,that I think we have to learn how to do.,This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business. 
 I guess it comes down to our education system,,so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education,,because I think that's where it really has to play out.,So for one, let's face it,,in the age of Google and Wikipedia,,the business model of the university,and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change.,We just can't sell facts for a living anymore.,They're available with a click of the mouse,,or if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall,one of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things,that tell us all this stuff. 
 So what do we have to do? We have to give our students,a taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference,,for what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts. 
 How do we do that?,Well, one of the problems, of course,,turns out to be testing.,We currently have an educational system,which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.,So in second grade, all the kids are interested in science,,the girls and the boys.,They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity.,They like to investigate things. They go to science museums.,They like to play around. They're in second grade.,They're interested.,But by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent,of them have any interest in science whatsoever,,let alone a desire to go into science as a career.,So we have this remarkably efficient system,for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head. 
 Is this what we want?,I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine,calls "the bulimic method of education.",You know. You can imagine what it is.,We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here,and then they puke it up on an exam over here,and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever. 
 This can't possibly continue to go on.,So what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say,,have an interesting maxim they live by.,Geneticists always say, you always get what you screen for.,And that's meant as a warning.,So we always will get what we screen for,,and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods.,Well, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation,,and we have to think carefully when we're testing,whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding,,whether we're weeding people out,,whether we're making some cut.,Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation,in the literature these days, in the educational literature,,but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts,to an opportunity for trial and error.,It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time,with this kind of feedback.,That's different than weeding, and usually, I have to tell you,,when people talk about evaluation, evaluating students,,evaluating teachers, evaluating schools,,evaluating programs, that they're really talking about weeding.,And that's a bad thing, because then you will get what you select for,,which is what we've gotten so far. 
 So I'd say what we need is a test that says, "What is x?",and the answers are "I don't know, because no one does,",or "What's the question?" Even better.,Or, "You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone,,I'll phone someone. I'll find out.",Because that's what we want people to do,,and that's how you evaluate them.,And maybe for the advanced placement classes,,it could be, "Here's the answer. What's the next question?",That's the one I like in particular. 
 So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats,,who said "Education is not about filling buckets;,it is lighting fires." 
 So I'd say, let's get out the matches.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking,through a window at a dolphinnspinning playfully,,but what you're actually looking through,is a two-way mirror at a dolphin,looking at itself spinning playfully.,This is a dolphin that is self-aware.,This dolphin has self-awareness.,It's a young dolphin named Bayley.,I've been very interestednin understanding the nature,of the intelligence of dolphinsnfor the past 30 years.,How do we explorenintelligence in this animal,that's so different from us?,And what I've used is a verynsimple research tool,,a mirror, and we've gainedngreat information,,reflections of these animal minds.,Dolphins aren't the only animals,nthe only non-human animals,,to show mirror self-recognition.,We used to think thisnwas a uniquely human ability,,but we learned that the greatnapes, our closest relatives,,also show this ability.,Then we showed it in dolphins,,and then later in elephants.,We did this work in my labnwith the dolphins and elephants,,and it's been recentlynshown in the magpie. 
 Now, it's interesting,nbecause we've embraced,this Darwinian view of a continuitynin physical evolution,,this physical continuity.,But we've been much morenreticent, much slower,at recognizing thisncontinuity in cognition,,in emotion, in consciousnessnin other animals. 
 Other animals are conscious.,They're emotional. They're aware.,There have been multitudesnof studies with many species,over the years that havengiven us exquisite evidence,for thinking and consciousnessnin other animals,,other animals that are quitendifferent than we are in form.,We are not alone.,We are not alone in these abilities.,And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,,is that, with our growing awareness,about the consciousness of others,and our relationship with the restnof the animal world,,that we'll give themnthe respect and protection,that they deserve.,So that's a wish I'm throwingnout here for everybody,,and I hope I can reallynengage you in this idea. 
 Now, I want to return to dolphins,,because these are the animalsnthat I feel like,I've been working up closelynand personal with,for over 30 years.,And these are real personalities.,They are not persons,nbut they're personalities,in every sense of the word.,And you can't get morenalien than the dolphin.,They are very differentnfrom us in body form.,They're radically different. They comenfrom a radically different environment.,In fact, we're separatednby 95 million years,of divergent evolution.,Look at this body.,And in every sense of making a pun here,,these are true non-terrestrials. 
 I wondered how we mightninterface with these animals.,In the 1980s, I developednan underwater keyboard.,This was a custom-madentouch-screen keyboard.,What I wanted to do was giventhe dolphins choice and control.,These are big brains,nhighly social animals,,and I thought, well, if we giventhem choice and control,,if they can hit a symbolnon this keyboard --,and by the way, it was interfacednby fiber optic cables,from Hewlett-Packardnwith an Apple II computer.,This seems prehistoric now,,but this was wherenwe were with technology.,So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,,they heard a computer-generated whistle,,and they got an object or activity. 
 Now here's a little video.,This is Delphi and Pan,nand you're going to see Delphi,hitting a key, he hears a computer-generatednwhistle -- (Whistle) --,and gets a ball, so they cannactually ask for things they want.,What was remarkable is,nthey explored this keyboard,on their own. There was nonintervention on our part.,They explored the keyboard.nThey played around with it.,They figured out how it worked.,And they started to quicklynimitate the sounds,they were hearing on the keyboard.,They imitated on their own. 
 Beyond that, though, they started learning,associationsnbetween the symbols, the sounds,and the objects.,What we saw was self-organized learning,,and now I'm imagining, what can we do,with new technologies?,How can we create interfaces,nnew windows into,the minds of animals,nwith the technologies that exist today?,So I was thinking about this,nand then, one day,,I got a call from Peter. 
 Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.,On a good day, it's music,,and I want to talk a little bit about,the most amazing music-makingnexperience I ever had.,I'm a farm boy. I grewnup surrounded by animals,,and I would look in these eyes and wonder,what was going on there?,So as an adult, whennI started to read about,the amazing breakthroughsnwith Penny Patterson and Koko,,with Sue Savage-Rumbaughnand Kanzi, Panbanisha,,Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,,I got all excited.,What was amazing to me also,was they seemed a lot more adept,at getting a handle on our language,than we were on gettingna handle on theirs.,I work with a lot of musiciansnfrom around the world,,and often we don't havenany common language at all,,but we sit down behind our instruments,,and suddenly there's a waynfor us to connect and emote. 
 So I started cold-calling,nand eventually got through,to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,,and she invited me down.,I went down, and the bonobos,had had access to percussion instruments,,musical toys, but nevernbefore to a keyboard.,At first they did what infants do,,just bashed it with their fists,,and then I asked, through Sue,,if Panbanisha could trynwith one finger only. 
 Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Cannyou play a grooming song?,I want to hear a grooming song.,Play a real quiet grooming song. 
 PG: So groom was the subject of the piece. 
 (Music) 
 So I'm just behind, jamming,,yeah, this is what we started with.,Sue's encouraging hernto continue a little more. 
 (Music) 
 She discovers a note she likes,,finds the octave.,She'd never sat at a keyboard before.,Nice triplets. 
 SSR: You did good. That was very good. 
 PG: She hit good. 
 (Applause) 
 So that night, we began to dream,,and we thought, perhapsnthe most amazing tool,that man's created is the Internet,,and what would happen if we could somehow,find new interfaces,,visual-audio interfaces that would allow,these remarkable sentient beings,that we share the planet with access?,And Sue Savage-Rumbaughngot excited about that,,called her friend Steve Woodruff,,and we began hustling all sorts of people,whose work related or was inspiring,,which led us to Diana,,and led us to Neil. 
 Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter.nPG: Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 NG: So Peter approached me.,I lost it when I saw that clip.,He approached me with a visionnof doing these things,not for people, for animals.,And then I was strucknin the history of the Internet.,This is what the Internetnlooked like when it was born,and you can call that the Internet,of middle-aged white men,,mostly middle-aged white men. 
 Vint Cerf: (Laughs) 
 (Laughter) 
 NG: Speaking as one. 
 Then, when I first came to TED,,which was where I metnPeter, I showed this.,This is a $1 web server,,and at the time that was radical.,And the possibility of makingna web server for a dollar,grew into what became knownnas the Internet of Things,,which is literally an industrynnow with tremendous implications,for health care, energy efficiency.,And we were happy with ourselves.,And then when Peter showed me that,,I realized we had missed something,,which is the rest of the planet. 
 So we started up thisninterspecies Internet project.,Now we started talking with TED,about how you bring dolphinsnand great apes and elephants,to TED, and we realizednthat wouldn't work.,So we're going to bring you to them.,So if we could switchnto the audio from this computer,,we've been video conferencingnwith cognitive animals,,and we're going to have each of them,just briefly introduce them.,And so if we could alsonhave this up, great.,So the first site we're going to meet,is Cameron Park Zoonin Waco, with orangutans.,In the daytime they live outside.nIt's nighttime there now.,So can you please go ahead? 
 Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox,with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,,and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,,two of our Bornean orangutans.,During the day, they havena beautiful, large outdoor habitat,,and at night, they come into this habitat,,into their night quarters,,where they can have a climate-controlled,and secure environment to sleep in.,We participate in the Appsnfor Apes program,Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads,to help stimulate and enrich the animals,,and also help raise awareness,for these critically endangered animals.,And they share 97 percent of our DNA,and are incredibly intelligent,,so it's so exciting to thinknof all the opportunities,that we have via technologynand the Internet,to really enrich their livesnand open up their world.,We're really excited about the possibility,of an interspecies Internet,,and K.J. hasnbeen enjoying the conference very much. 
 NG: That's great. When we werenrehearsing last night,,he had fun watching the elephants.,Next user group are the dolphinsnat the National Aquarium.,Please go ahead. 
 Allison Ginsburg: Good evening.,Well, my name is Allison Ginsburg,,and we're live in Baltimorenat the National Aquarium.,Joining me are three of our eight Atlanticnbottlenose dolphins:,20-year-old Chesapeake,nwho was our first dolphin born here,,her four-year-old daughter Bayley,,and her half sister, 11-year-old Maya.,Now, here at the National Aquarium,we are committed to excellencenin animal care,,to research, and to conservation.,The dolphins are pretty intriguednas to what's going on here tonight.,They're not really usednto having cameras here,at 8 o'clock at night.,In addition, we are veryncommitted to doing,different types of research.,As Diana mentioned,nour animals are involved,in many different research studies. 
 NG: Those are for you.,Okay, that's great, thank you.,And the third user group, in Thailand,,is Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh. 
 Josh Plotnik: Hi, my name is Josh Plotnik,,and I'm with ThinknElephants International,,and we're here in the GoldennTriangle of Thailand,with the Golden Triangle AsiannElephant Foundation elephants.,And we have 26 elephants here,,and our research is focused on the evolutionnof intelligence with elephants,,but our foundation ThinknElephants is focused,on bringing elephantsninto classrooms around the world,virtually like this and showing people,how incredible these animals are.,So we're able to bring the cameranright up to the elephant,,put food into the elephant's mouth,,show people what's goingnon inside their mouths,,and show everyone around the world,how incredible these animals really are. 
 NG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh.,And once again, we've been buildingngreat relationships,among them justnsince we've been rehearsing.,So at that point, if we can gonback to the other computer,,we were starting to thinknabout how you integrate,the rest of the biomassnof the planet into the Internet,,and we went to the best possible person,I can think of, which is Vint Cerf,,who is one of the foundersnwho gave us the Internet. Vint? 
 VC: Thank you, Neil. 
 (Applause) 
 A long time ago in a galaxyn— oops, wrong script.,Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I,did the design of the Internet.,Thirty years ago, we turned it on.,Just last year, we turnednon the production Internet.,You've been using the experimental version,for the last 30 years.,The production version,nit uses IP version 6.,It has 3.4 times 10 to the 38thnpossible terminations.,That's a number only that Congressncan appreciate.,But it leads to what is coming next. 
 When Bob and I did this design,,we thought we were building a systemnto connect computers together.,What we very quickly discovered,is that this was a systemnfor connecting people together.,And what you've seen tonight,tells you that we shouldnnot restrict this network,to one species,,that these other intelligent,nsentient species,should be part of the system too. 
 This is the system as itnlooks today, by the way.,This is what the Internetnlooks like to a computer,that's trying to figurenout where the traffic,is supposed to go.,This is generated by a program,that's looking at the connectivitynof the Internet,,and how all the various networksnare connected together.,There are about 400,000nnetworks, interconnected,,run independently by 400,000ndifferent operating agencies,,and the only reason this works,is that they all use the samenstandard TCP/IP protocols. 
 Well, you know where this is headed.,The Internet of Things tell us,that a lot of computer-enablednappliances and devices,are going to become partnof this system too:,appliances that you use around the house,,that you use in your office,,that you carry around with yourselfnor in the car.,That's the Internetnof Things that's coming.,Now, what's importantnabout what these people are doing,is that they're beginning to learn,how to communicate with species,that are not us,but share a common sensory environment.,We're beginning to explore what it means,to communicate with something,that isn't just another person.,Well, you can see what's coming next.,All kinds of possible sentient beings,may be interconnected through this system,,and I can't wait to seenthese experiments unfold. 
 What happens after that?,Well, let's see.,There are machines that neednto talk to machines,and that we need to talk to,nand so as time goes on,,we're going to have to learn,how to communicate with computers,and how to get computersnto communicate with us,in the way that we're accustomed to,,not with keyboards, not with mice,,but with speech and gestures,and all the natural human languagenthat we're accustomed to.,So we'll need something like C3PO,to become a translator between ourselves,and some of the othernmachines we live with. 
 Now, there is a project that's underway,called the interplanetary Internet.,It's in operation between Earth and Mars.,It's operating on the InternationalnSpace Station.,It's part of the spacecraftnthat's in orbit around the Sun,that's rendezvoused with two planets.,So the interplanetarynsystem is on its way,,but there's a last project,,which the Defense AdvancednResearch Projects Agency,,which funded the original ARPANET,,funded the Internet, fundednthe interplanetary architecture,,is now funding a projectnto design a spacecraft,to get to the nearestnstar in 100 years' time.,What that meansnis that what we're learning,with these interactions with other species,will teach us, ultimately,,how we might interactnwith an alien from another world.,I can hardly wait. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: So first of all, thank you,,and I would like to acknowledgenthat four people,who could talk to us for full four days,actually managed to staynto four minutes each,,and we thank you for that.,I have so many questions,,but maybe a few practical thingsnthat the audience might want to know.,You're launching this idea here at TED —nPG: Today. 
 JC: Today. This is the firstntime you're talking about it.,Tell me a little bit about wherenyou're going to take the idea.,What's next? 
 PG: I think we wantnto engage as many people,here as possible in helping us,think of smart interfacesnthat will make all this possible. 
 NG: And just mechanically,,there's a 501(c)(3) and web infrastructure,and all of that, but it's notnquite ready to turn on,,so we'll roll that out, and contact us,if you want the information on it.,The idea is this will be -- muchnlike the Internet functions,as a network of networks,,which is Vint's core contribution,,this will be a wrappernaround all of these initiatives,,that are wonderful individually,nto link them globally. 
 JC: Right, and do you have a web address,that we might look for yet? 
 NG: Shortly. JC: Shortly. Wenwill come back to you on that.,And very quickly, just to clarify.,Some people might have lookednat the video that you showed,and thought, well, that's just a webcam.,What's special about it?,If you could talk for just a moment,about how you want to go past that? 
 NG: So this is scalablenvideo infrastructure,,not for a few to a few but many to many,,so that it scalesnto symmetrical video sharing,and content sharing across thesensites around the planet.,So there's a lot of back-endnsignal processing,,not for one to many, but for many to many. 
 JC: Right, and then on a practical level,,which technologies are younlooking at first?,I know you mentioned that a keyboardnis a really key part of this. 
 DR: We're trying to developnan interactive touch screen for dolphins.,This is sort of a continuationnof some of the earlier work,,and we just got our first seednmoney today towards that,,so it's our first project. 
 JC: Before the talk, even. DR: Yeah. 
 JC: Wow. Well done.,All right, well thank younall so much for joining us.,It's such a delightnto have you on the stage. 
 DR: Thank you. VC: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Miranda Wang: We're herento talk about accidents.,How do you feel about accidents?,When we think about accidents,,we usually consider them to be harmful,,unfortunate or even dangerous,nand they certainly can be.,But are they always that bad?,The discovery that had lednto penicillin, for example,,is one of the most fortunatenaccidents of all time.,Without biologist AlexandernFleming's moldy accident,,caused by a neglected workstation,,we wouldn't be able to fightnoff so many bacterial infections.,Jeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today,because we'd like to sharenhow our accidents,have led to discoveries.,In 2011, we visited the VancouvernWaste Transfer Station,and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.,We realized that whennplastics get to the dump,,it's difficult to sort themnbecause they have similar densities,,and when they're mixed with organic matter,and construction debris,nit's truly impossible,to pick them out and environmentallyneliminate them.,MW: However, plastics are useful,because they're durable, flexible,,and can be easily moldedninto so many useful shapes.,The downside of this convenience,is that there's a high cost to this.,Plastics cause serious problems, such as,the destruction of ecosystems,,the pollution of natural resources,,and the reduction of available land space.,This picture you see herenis the Great Pacific Gyre.,When you think about plastic pollution,and the marine environment,,we think about the Great Pacific Gyre,,which is supposed to be a floatingnisland of plastic waste.,But that's no longer an accurate depiction,of plastic pollutionnin the marine environment.,Right now, the ocean is actuallyna soup of plastic debris,,and there's nowhere youncan go in the ocean,where you wouldn't be ablento find plastic particles.,JY: In a plastic-dependent society,,cutting down production is a goodngoal, but it's not enough.,And what about the wastenthat's already been produced?,Plastics take hundreds to thousandsnof years to biodegrade.,So we thought, you know what?,Instead of waiting for that garbagento sit there and pile up,,let's find a way to break them down,with bacteria.,Sounds cool, right?,Audience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.,But we had a problem.,You see, plastics havenvery complex structures,and are difficult to biodegrade.,Anyhow, we were curious and hopeful,and still wanted to give it a go.,MW: With this idea in mind,nJeanny and I read through,some hundreds of scientificnarticles on the Internet,,and we drafted a research proposal,in the beginning of our grade 12 year.,We aimed to find bacterianfrom our local Fraser River,that can degrade a harmfulnplasticizer called phthalates.,Phthalates are additives usednin everyday plastic products,to increase their flexibility,ndurability and transparency.,Although they're part of the plastic,,they're not covalently bondednto the plastic backbone.,As a result, they easilynescape into our environment.,Not only do phthalatesnpollute our environment,,but they also pollute our bodies.,To make the matter worse,nphthalates are found in products,to which we have a highnexposure, such as babies' toys,,beverage containers, cosmetics,nand even food wraps.,Phthalates are horrible because,they're so easily taken into our bodies.,They can be absorbed by skinncontact, ingested, and inhaled.,JY: Every year, at least 470nmillion pounds of phthalates,contaminate our air, water and soil.,The Environmental Protection Agency,even classified this groupnas a top-priority pollutant,because it's been shown to causencancer and birth defects,by acting as a hormone disruptor.,We read that each year,nthe Vancouver municipal government,monitors phthalatenconcentration levels in rivers,to assess their safety.,So we figured, if therenare places along our Fraser River,that are contaminated with phthalates,,and if there are bacterianthat are able to live in these areas,,then perhaps, perhaps thesenbacteria could have evolved,to break down phthalates.,MW: So we presented this good idea,to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the Universitynof British Columbia,,and surprisingly, he actuallyntook us into his lab,and asked his graduate studentsnAdam and James to help us.,Little did we know at that time,that a trip to the dumpnand some research on the Internet,and plucking up the couragento act upon inspiration,would take us on a life-changing journey,of accidents and discoveries.,JY: The first step in our project,was to collect soil samplesnfrom three different sites,along the Fraser River.,Out of thousands of bacteria,nwe wanted to find ones,that could break down phthalates,,so we enriched our culturesnwith phthalates,as the only carbon source.,This implied that, if anythingngrew in our cultures,,then they must be ablento live off of phthalates.,Everything went well from there,,and we became amazing scientists.n(Laughter),MW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.,MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.,You see, I accidentally cracked the flask,that had contained our thirdnenrichment culture,,and as a result, we had to wipendown the incubator room,with bleach and ethanol twice.,And this is only one of the examplesnof the many accidents,that happened during our experimentation.,But this mistake turnednout to be rather serendipitous.,We noticed that the unharmed cultures,came from placesnof opposite contamination levels,,so this mistake actuallynled us to think that,perhaps we can compare,the different degradativenpotentials of bacteria,from sitesnof opposite contamination levels.,JY: Now that we grew the bacteria,,we wanted to isolate strainsnby streaking onto mediate plates,,because we thought that would be,less accident-prone,nbut we were wrong again.,We poked holes in our agar while streaking,and contaminated some samples and funghi.,As a result, we had to streaknand restreak several times.,Then we monitored phthalate utilization,and bacterial growth,,and found that they sharednan inverse correlation,,so as bacterial populations increased,,phthalate concentrations decreased.,This means that our bacteria werenactually living off of phthalates.,MW: So now that we found bacterianthat could break down phthalates,,we wondered what these bacteria were.,So Jeanny and I tooknthree of our most efficient strains,and then performed genenamplification sequencing on them,and matched our data with an onlinencomprehensive database.,We were happy to see that,,although our three strains hadnbeen previously identified bacteria,,two of them were not previously associated,with phthalate degradation, so thisnwas actually a novel discovery.,JY: To better understandnhow this biodegradation works,,we wanted to verify the catabolicnpathways of our three strains.,To do this, we extractednenzymes from our bacteria,and reacted with an intermediatenof phthalic acid.,MW: We monitored this experimentnwith spectrophotometry,and obtained this beautiful graph.,This graph showsnthat our bacteria really do have,a genetic pathwaynto biodegrade phthalates.,Our bacteria can transform phthalates,nwhich is a harmful toxin,,into end products suchnas carbon dioxide, water,and alcohol.,I know some of younin the crowd are thinking,,well, carbon dioxide is horrible,nit's a greenhouse gas.,But if our bacteria did notnevolve to break down phthalates,,they would have used some othernkind of carbon source,,and aerobic respiration would have led it,to have end products suchnas carbon dioxide anyway.,We were also interested to see that,,although we've obtained greater diversity,of bacteria biodegradersnfrom the bird habitat site,,we obtained the most efficientndegraders from the landfill site.,So this fully shows that nature evolves,through natural selection.,JY: So Miranda and I shared this research,at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challengencompetition and were recognized,with the greatestncommercialization potential.,Although we're not the firstnones to find bacteria,that can break down phthalates,,we were the first onesnto look into our local river,and find a possible solutionnto a local problem.,We have not only shown that bacteria,can be the solution to plasticnpollution, but also that,being open to uncertainnoutcomes and taking risks,create opportunitiesnfor unexpected discoveries.,Throughout this journey, we have alsondiscovered our passion for science,,and are currently continuing research,on other fossil fuelnchemicals in university.,We hope that in the near future,,we'll be able to create model organisms,that can break down not only phthalates,but a wide varietynof different contaminants.,We can apply this to wastewaterntreatment plants,to clean up our rivers,and other natural resources.,And perhaps one daynwe'll be able to tackle,the problem of solid plastic waste.,MW: I think our journeynhas truly transformed,our view of microorganisms,,and Jeanny and I have shown that,even mistakes can lead to discoveries.,Einstein once said,,"You can't solve problemsnby using the same kind,of thinking you usednwhen you created them.",If we're making plasticnsynthetically, then we think,the solution would be to breaknthem down biochemically.,Thank you. JY: Thank you.,(Applause)I want to talk about social innovation,and social entrepreneurship.,I happen to have triplets.,They're little. They're five years old.,Sometimes I tell people I have triplets.nThey say, "Really? How many?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's a picture of the kids --nthat's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.,Now, I also happen to be gay.,Being gay and fathering triplets is by far,the most socially innovative,nsocially entrepreneurial thing,I have ever done. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The real social innovation I wantnto talk about involves charity.,I want to talk about how the thingsnwe've been taught to think,about giving and about charity,and about the nonprofit sector,,are actually underminingnthe causes we love,,and our profound yearningnto change the world. 
 But before I do that,nI want to ask if we even believe,that the nonprofit sectornhas any serious role to play,in changing the world.,A lot of people say now that businessnwill lift up the developing economies,,and social businessnwill take care of the rest.,And I do believe that business will moventhe great mass of humanity forward.,But it always leaves behindnthat 10 percent or more,that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.,And social business needs markets,,and there are some issuesnfor which you just can't develop,the kind of money measuresnthat you need for a market. 
 I sit on the board of a centernfor the developmentally disabled,,and these people want laughter,and compassion and they want love.,How do you monetize that?,And that's where the nonprofit sectornand philanthropy come in.,Philanthropy is the market for love.,It is the market for all those people,for whom there is no other market coming.,And so if we really want,nlike Buckminster Fuller said,,a world that works for everyone,,with no one and nothing left out,,then the nonprofit sector has to be,a serious part of the conversation. 
 But it doesn't seem to be working.,Why have our breast cancerncharities not come close,to finding a cure for breast cancer,,or our homeless charities not come close,to ending homelessness in any major city?,Why has poverty remained stuck,at 12 percent of the U.S.npopulation for 40 years? 
 And the answer is,,these social problemsnare massive in scale,,our organizationsnare tiny up against them,,and we have a belief systemnthat keeps them tiny.,We have two rulebooks.,We have one for the nonprofit sector,,and one for the restnof the economic world.,It's an apartheid, and it discriminates,against the nonprofit sectornin five different areas,,the first being compensation. 
 So in the for-profit sector,nthe more value you produce,,the more money you can make.,But we don't like nonprofits to use money,to incentivize peoplento produce more in social service.,We have a visceral reactionnto the idea that anyone,would make very much moneynhelping other people.,Interestingly, we don't havena visceral reaction,to the notion that peoplenwould make a lot of money,not helping other people.,You know, you want to maken50 million dollars,selling violent video gamesnto kids, go for it.,We'll put you on the covernof Wired magazine.,But you want to makenhalf a million dollars,trying to cure kids of malaria,,and you're considered a parasite yourself. 
 (Applause) 
 And we think of thisnas our system of ethics,,but what we don't realizenis that this system,has a powerful side effect, which is:,It gives a really stark,nmutually exclusive choice,between doing very wellnfor yourself and your family,or doing good for the world,,to the brightest mindsncoming out of our best universities,,and sends tens of thousands of people,who could make a huge differencenin the nonprofit sector,,marching every yearndirectly into the for-profit sector,because they're not willing to makenthat kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.,Businessweek did a survey,nlooked at the compensation packages,for MBAs 10 years out of business school.,And the median compensationnfor a Stanford MBA,,with bonus, at the age of 38,nwas 400,000 dollars.,Meanwhile, for the same year,nthe average salary,for the CEO of a $5 million-plusnmedical charity in the U.S.,was 232,000 dollars,nand for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.,Now, there's no way you'rengoing to get a lot of people,with $400,000 talent to makena $316,000 sacrifice every year,to become the CEO of a hunger charity. 
 Some people say, "Well, that's justnbecause those MBA types are greedy.",Not necessarily. They might be smart.,It's cheaper for that person to donate,100,000 dollars every yearnto the hunger charity;,save 50,000 dollars on their taxes --,so still be roughly 270,000 dollarsna year ahead of the game --,now be called a philanthropistnbecause they donated,100,000 dollars to charity;,probably sit on the boardnof the hunger charity;,indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB,who decided to become the CEOnof the hunger charity; 
 (Laughter) 
 and have a lifetimenof this kind of power and influence,and popular praise still ahead of them. 
 The second area of discriminationnis advertising and marketing.,So we tell the for-profit sector,n"Spend, spend, spend on advertising,,until the last dollar no longernproduces a penny of value.",But we don't like to see our donationsnspent on advertising in charity.,Our attitude is, "Well, look,nif you can get the advertising donated,,you know, to air at four o'clocknin the morning, I'm okay with that.,But I don't want my donationnspent on advertising,,I want it go to the needy.",As if the money invested in advertising,could not bring in dramaticallyngreater sums of money,to serve the needy. 
 In the 1990s, my company created,the long-distancenAIDSRide bicycle journeys,,and the 60 mile-longnbreast cancer three-day walks,,and over the course of nine years,,we had 182,000 ordinarynheroes participate,,and they raised a totalnof 581 million dollars. 
 (Applause) 
 They raised more moneynmore quickly for these causes,than any events in history,,all based on the ideanthat people are weary,of being asked to do the leastnthey can possibly do.,People are yearning to measurenthe full distance of their potential,on behalf of the causesnthat they care about deeply.,But they have to be asked.,We got that many people to participate,by buying full-page adsnin The New York Times,,in The Boston Globe, in prime timenradio and TV advertising.,Do you know how many peoplenwe would've gotten,if we put up fliers in the laundromat? 
 Charitable giving has remained stucknin the U.S., at two percent of GDP,,ever since we startednmeasuring it in the 1970s.,That's an important fact,nbecause it tells us,that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector,has not been ablento wrestle any market share,away from the for-profit sector.,And if you think about it,nhow could one sector,possibly take market sharenaway from another sector,if it isn't really allowed to market?,And if we tell the consumer brands,,"You may advertisenall the benefits of your product,",but we tell charities, "You cannotnadvertise all the good that you do,",where do we think the consumerndollars are going to flow? 
 The third area of discriminationnis the taking of risk,in pursuit of new ideasnfor generating revenue.,So Disney can make a newn$200 million movie that flops,,and nobody calls the attorney general.,But you do a little $1 millionncommunity fundraiser for the poor,,and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profitnto the cause in the first 12 months,,and your characternis called into question.,So nonprofits are really reluctantnto attempt any brave,,daring, giant-scalennew fundraising endeavors,,for fear that if the thing fails,,their reputations will be draggednthrough the mud.,Well, you and I know,when you prohibit failure,nyou kill innovation.,If you kill innovation in fundraising,nyou can't raise more revenue;,if you can't raise more revenue,nyou can't grow;,and if you can't grow, you can'tnpossibly solve large social problems. 
 The fourth area is time.,So Amazon went for six yearsnwithout returning any profit to investors,,and people had patience.,They knew that there was a long-termnobjective down the line,,of building market dominance.,But if a nonprofit organizationnever had a dream,of building magnificent scalenthat required that for six years,,no money was going to go to the needy,,it was all going to be investednin building this scale,,we would expect a crucifixion. 
 The last area is profit itself.,So the for-profit sectorncan pay people profits,in order to attract their capitalnfor their new ideas,,but you can't pay profitsnin a nonprofit sector,,so the for-profit sector has a lock,on the multi-trillion-dollarncapital markets,,and the nonprofit sector is starvednfor growth and risk and idea capital. 
 Well, you put thosenfive things together --,you can't use money to lure talentnaway from the for-profit sector;,you can't advertisenon anywhere near the scale,the for-profit sectorndoes for new customers;,you can't take the kinds of risksnin pursuit of those customers,that the for-profit sector takes;,you don't have the same amount of timento find them as the for-profit sector;,and you don't have a stock marketnwith which to fund any of this,,even if you could do itnin the first place --,and you've just put the nonprofit sector,at an extreme disadvantagento the for-profit sector,,on every level.,If we have any doubts about the effectsnof this separate rule book,,this statistic is sobering:,From 1970 to 2009,,the number of nonprofits that really grew,,that crossed the $50 millionnannual revenue barrier,,is 144.,In the same time, the numbernof for-profits that crossed it,is 46,136.,So we're dealing with social problemsnthat are massive in scale,,and our organizationsncan't generate any scale.,All of the scale goesnto Coca-Cola and Burger King. 
 So why do we think this way?,Well, like most fanaticalndogma in America,,these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.,The Puritans came herenfor religious reasons, or so they said,,but they also came here becausenthey wanted to make a lot of money.,They were pious people,,but they were alsonreally aggressive capitalists,,and they were accused of extreme formsnof profit-making tendencies,,compared to the other colonists.,But at the same time,nthe Puritans were Calvinists,,so they were taught literallynto hate themselves.,They were taughtnthat self-interest was a raging sea,that was a sure path to eternal damnation.,This created a real problemnfor these people.,Here they've come all the way acrossnthe Atlantic to make all this money,,but making all this moneynwill get you sent directly to Hell.,What were they to do about this? 
 Well, charity became their answer.,It became this economic sanctuary,,where they could do penancenfor their profit-making tendencies --,at five cents on the dollar.,So of course, how could younmake money in charity,if charity was your penancenfor making money?,Financial incentive was exilednfrom the realm of helping others,,so that it could thrive in the areanof making money for yourself,,and in 400 years, nothing has intervened,to say, "That's counterproductivenand that's unfair." 
 Now, this ideology gets policednby this one very dangerous question,,which is, "What percentage of my donationngoes to the cause versus overhead?",There are a lot of problemsnwith this question.,I'm going to just focus on two.,First, it makes us thinknthat overhead is a negative,,that it is somehow not part of the cause.,But it absolutely is, especiallynif it's being used for growth.,Now, this idea that overheadnis somehow an enemy of the cause,creates this second, much larger problem,,which is, it forces organizationsnto go without the overhead things,they really need to grow,,in the interest of keeping overhead low. 
 So we've all been taughtnthat charities should spend,as little as possible on overheadnthings like fundraising,under the theory that, well, the lessnmoney you spend on fundraising,,the more money there isnavailable for the cause.,Well, that's truenif it's a depressing world,in which this pie cannotnbe made any bigger.,But if it's a logical worldnin which investment in fundraising,actually raises more fundsnand makes the pie bigger,,then we have it precisely backwards,,and we should be investing more money,nnot less, in fundraising,,because fundraising is the one thing,that has the potentialnto multiply the amount of money,available for the causenthat we care about so deeply. 
 I'll give you two examples.,We launched the AIDSRides,with an initial investmentnof 50,000 dollars in risk capital.,Within nine years,nwe had multiplied that 1,982 times,,into 108 million dollarsnafter all expenses, for AIDS services.,We launched the breast cancer three-days,with an initial investmentnof 350,000 dollars in risk capital.,Within just five years,nwe had multiplied that 554 times,,into 194 million dollarsnafter all expenses,,for breast cancer research.,Now, if you were a philanthropistnreally interested in breast cancer,,what would make more sense:,go out and find the most innovativenresearcher in the world,and give her 350,000 dollars for research,,or give her fundraisingndepartment the 350,000 dollars,to multiply it into 194 million dollarsnfor breast cancer research?,2002 was our most successful year ever.,We netted for breast cancernalone, that year alone,,71 million dollars after all expenses.,And then we went out of business,,suddenly and traumatically. 
 Why? Well, the short story is,nour sponsors split on us.,They wanted to distance themselves from us,because we were beingncrucified in the media,for investing 40 percentnof the gross in recruitment,and customer servicenand the magic of the experience,,and there is no accountingnterminology to describe,that kind of investmentnin growth and in the future,,other than this demonicnlabel of "overhead.",So on one day, all 350nof our great employees,lost their jobs ...,because they were labeled "overhead.",Our sponsor went and triednthe events on their own.,The overhead went up.,Net income for breast cancer researchnwent down by 84 percent,,or 60 million dollars, in one year. 
 This is what happens when we confusenmorality with frugality.,We've all been taught that the bake salenwith five percent overhead,is morally superior to the professionalnfundraising enterprise,with 40 percent overhead,,but we're missing the most importantnpiece of information, which is:,What is the actual size of these pies?,Who cares if the bake sale only hasnfive percent overhead if it's tiny?,What if the bake salenonly netted 71 dollars for charity,because it made no investment in its scale,and the professionalnfundraising enterprise netted,71 million dollars because it did?,Now which pie would we prefer,,and which pie do we think peoplenwho are hungry would prefer? 
 Here's how all of thisnimpacts the big picture.,I said that charitable giving isntwo percent of GDP in the United States.,That's about 300 billion dollars a year.,But only about 20 percent of that,nor 60 billion dollars,,goes to health and human services causes.,The rest goes to religionnand higher education and hospitals,,and that 60 billion dollarsnis not nearly enough,to tackle these problems.,But if we could move charitable givingnfrom two percent of GDP,,up just one step to three percent of GDP,nby investing in that growth,,that would be an extra 150 billion dollarsna year in contributions,,and if that moneyncould go disproportionately,to health and human services charities,,because those were the ones we encouragednto invest in their growth,,that would represent a triplingnof contributions to that sector.,Now we're talking scale.,Now we're talking the potentialnfor real change.,But it's never going to happennby forcing these organizations,to lower their horizons,to the demoralizing objectivenof keeping their overhead low. 
 Our generation does not wantnits epitaph to read,,"We kept charity overhead low." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We want it to readnthat we changed the world,,and that part of the way we did that,was by changing the waynwe think about these things. 
 So the next timenyou're looking at a charity,,don't ask about the ratenof their overhead.,Ask about the scale of their dreams,,their Apple-, Google-,nAmazon-scale dreams,,how they measure their progressntoward those dreams,,and what resources they neednto make them come true,,regardless of what the overhead is.,Who cares what the overhead is,if these problemsnare actually getting solved? 
 If we can have that kind of generosity --,a generosity of thought --,then the non-profit sectorncan play a massive role,in changing the worldnfor all those citizens,most desperately in need of it to change.,And if that can benour generation's enduring legacy --,that we took responsibility,for the thinking that hadnbeen handed down to us,,that we revisited it, we revised it,,and we reinvented the whole waynhumanity thinks about changing things,,forever, for everyone --,well, I thought I would letnthe kids sum up what that would be. 
 Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be 
 Sage Smith-Pallotta: a real social 
 Rider Smith-Pallotta: innovation. 
 Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much,of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,,but I thought it would just be nice to recap,on how Derek got to where he is today. 
 It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,,but when Derek was born,,he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.,He was born three and a half months premature,,and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.,He had to have a lot of oxygen,,and that affected your eyes, Derek,,and also the way you understand language,and the way you understand the world.,But that was the end of the bad news,,because when Derek came home from the hospital,,his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny,who was going to look after you, Derek,,really for the rest of your childhood.,And Nanny's great insight, really,,was to think, here's a child who can't see.,Music must be the thing for Derek.,And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,,to him for his first few years of life.,And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice,hour after hour every day that made him think,maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,,some sort of musical gift.,Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,,when you were with your nanny. 
 Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,,perhaps we should get Derek something to play,,and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard,out of the loft, never thinking really,that anything much would come of it.,But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing,and actually bashed it,,bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.,But out of all the bashing, after a few months,,emerged the most fantastic music,,and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,,when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world,out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.,That was the great eureka moment. 
 Now, not being able to see meant, of course,,that you taught yourself. 
 Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play. 
 AO: You did teach yourself to play,,and as a consequence,,playing the piano for you, Derek,,was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,,and even a bit of nose going on in there. 
 And now, here's what Nanny did also do,was to press the record button on one of those little,early tape recorders that they had,,and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing,when you were four years old. 
 DP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)." 
 AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels.",This one is "English Country Garden." 
 DP: "English Country Garden." 
 (Music: "English Country Garden") 
 AO: There you are. 
 (Applause) 
 I think that's just fantastic.,You know, there's this little child who can't see,,can't really understand much about the world,,has no one in the family who plays an instrument,,and yet he taught himself to play that.,And as you can see from the picture,,there was quite a lot of body action going on,while you were playing, Derek. 
 Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,,and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,,because when you played the piano,,you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,,and also you had this little habit,of hitting me out of the way.,So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,,I was firmly shoved off.,And having said to your dad, Nic,,that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused,as to how I might go about that,if I wasn't allowed near the piano.,But after a while, I thought, well, the only way,is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,,and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,,I could just play something very quickly,for him to learn.,And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed,that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.,As you can see, there's me in my early,,pre-marriage days with a brown beard,,and little Derek concentrating there. 
 I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really,had taken the world by storm.,This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican,with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.,Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.,And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,,and so there was always a moment of tension,as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play,and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,,and all that kind of thing.,But the orchestra were wowed as well,,and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability,to play these fantastic pieces. 
 Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?,And hopefully we can show the audience now,how it is you do what you do. 
 I think that one of the first things that happened,when you were very little, Derek,,was that by the time you were two,,your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.,And so whenever you heard any note at all --,if I just play a random note --,(Piano notes) --,you knew instantly what it was,,and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.,Now that's called perfect pitch,,and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes,in the middle of the piano. 
 (Piano notes) 
 You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek. 
 (Applause) 
 But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.,If I just put the microphone down for a bit,,I'm going to play a cluster of notes.,Those of you who can see will know how many notes,,but Derek, of course, can't.,Not only can you say how many notes,,it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are. 
 (Chords) 
 Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.,And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,,not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,,Derek, you can hear every note,,and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,,reproduce those on the keyboard,,that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability. 
 Now then.,It's no use having that kind of raw ability,without the technique,,and luckily, Derek, you decided that,,once we did start learning, you'd let me help you,learn all the scale fingerings.,So for example using your thumb under with C major. 
 (Piano notes) 
 Etc. 
 And in the end, you got so quick,,that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee",were no problem, were they? 
 DP: No. 
 AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,,Derek was playing things like this. 
 DP: This. 
 (Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee"),(Applause) 
 AO: Derek, let's have a bow. 
 Well done. 
 Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,,you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee",in the usual key, but any note I play,,Derek can play it on.,So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.,(Piano notes),Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note? 
 DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note. 
 (Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee") 
 AO: Or another one? How about in G minor? 
 DP: G minor. 
 (Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee") 
 AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek. 
 So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer,that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,,all the pieces in the world that are out there.,Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,,"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee',in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.,In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,,you'd learned the version that you'd learned,,and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,,so while we were waiting in the two hours,before the rehearsal and the concert,,Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly,and then was able to play it with the orchestra.,Fantastic chap. 
 The other wonderful thing about you is memory. 
 DP: Memory.nAO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,,we ask the audience to participate, of course,,by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.,And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave,because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?",And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,,because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,,you're invited to come and sing it first,,and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter) 
 So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish. 
 But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece? 
 DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose?nAO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.,Would you like to hear me play? 
 (Audience: "Theme of Paganini.") 
 AO: Paganini.nDP: "The Theme of Paganini." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music: "Theme of Paganini") 
 (Applause) 
 AO: Well done. 
 Derek's going to L.A. soon,,and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I,will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,,which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek? 
 DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes. 
 AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,,but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in America, they've coined this term,,"the human iPod" for Derek,,which I think is just missing the point, really,,because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.,You're a fantastic, creative musician,,and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,,than when we went to Slovenia,,and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,,and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage. 
 DP: He played "Chopsticks."nAO: And played "Chopsticks." 
 DP: "Chopsticks." 
 AO: A bit like this.nDP: Like this. Yes. 
 (Piano notes) 
 AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.,He's sitting there. 
 DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this.nAO: Just teasing, right? Here we go. 
 (Music: "Chopsticks") 
 DP: Let Derek play it. 
 AO: What did you do with it, Derek? 
 DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam. 
 AO: This is Derek the musician.,(Music: "Chopsticks" improvisation) 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) (Clapping) 
 Keep up with Derek. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 The TED people will kill me,,but perhaps there's time for one encore. 
 DP: For one encore.nAO: One encore, yes. 
 So this is one of Derek's heroes.,It's the great Art Tatum --nDP: Art Tatum. 
 AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,,and also, I think, like Derek,,thought that all the world was a piano,,so whenever Art Tatum plays something,,it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.,And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag." 
 DP: "Tiger Rag." 
 (Music: "Tiger Rag") 
 (Applause)In 1991 I had,maybe the most profound and transformative,experience of my life.,I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.,I took a couple victory laps in there.,And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,,and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,,and we were relaxing next to this beautiful,idyllic lake in the mountains.,And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,,and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in,from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds,rolling toward us,,and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,,so help me God, every single animal in that place,stopped making noise at the same time.,(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.,And then the clouds came over us, and then,,boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.,It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home,I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,,and decided to set it to music,,a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,",which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. 
 Now fast forward to just three years ago.,(Music) And we released to YouTube this,,the Virtual Choir Project,,185 singers from 12 different countries.,You can see my little video there conducting these people,,alone in their dorm rooms,or in their living rooms at home.,Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered,Virtual Choir 2,,2,052 singers from 58 different countries,,this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep.",And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,,"Water Night," another piece that I had written,,this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.,(Music) 
 And when I was speaking to Chris about the future,of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,,he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.,Could we do this all in real time?,Could we have people singing together in real time? 
 And with the help of Skype,,that is what we are going to attempt today.,Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.,The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.,I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,,Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,,some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —,(Applause) --,and in the second half of the piece,,the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers,from 30 different countries. 
 Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,,but there's still less than a second of latency,,but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.,We deal in milliseconds.,So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst",so that it embraces the latency,and the performers sing into the latency,instead of trying to be exactly together. 
 So with deep humility, and for your approval,,we present "Cloudburst." 
 (Applause)

 ["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] 
 Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.,(Applause),Thank you.We are going to take a quick voyage,over the cognitive history of the 20th century,,because during that century,,our minds have altered dramatically.,As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900,have altered because the roads are better,and because of technology.,And our minds have altered, too.,We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world,and analyzed that world primarily in terms,of how much it would benefit them,to people who confront a very complex world,,and it's a world where we've had to develop,new mental habits, new habits of mind.,And these include things like,clothing that concrete world with classification,,introducing abstractions that we try to make,logically consistent,,and also taking the hypothetical seriously,,that is, wondering about what might have been,rather than what is. 
 Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention,through massive I.Q. gains over time,,and these have been truly massive.,That is, we don't just get a few more questions right,on I.Q. tests.,We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests,than each succeeding generation,back to the time that they were invented.,Indeed, if you score the people a century ago,against modern norms,,they would have an average I.Q. of 70.,If you score us against their norms,,we would have an average I.Q. of 130.,Now this has raised all sorts of questions.,Were our immediate ancestors,on the verge of mental retardation?,Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.,Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?,Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness. 
 Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative,that's much more illuminating than either of those,,and to put this into perspective,,let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth,and found a ruined civilization.,And this Martian was an archaeologist,,and they found scores, target scores,,that people had used for shooting.,And first they looked at 1865,,and they found that in a minute,,people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.,And then they found, in 1898,,that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.,And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.,And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.,They would say, look, these tests were designed,to find out how much people were steady of hand,,how keen their eyesight was,,whether they had control of their weapon.,How could these performances have escalated,to this enormous degree?,Well we now know, of course, the answer.,If that Martian looked at battlefields,,they would find that people had only muskets,at the time of the Civil War,and that they had repeating rifles,at the time of the Spanish-American War,,and then they had machine guns,by the time of World War I.,And, in other words, it was the equipment,that was in the hands of the average soldier,that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye,or steadiness of hand. 
 Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery,that we have picked up over those hundred years,,and I think again that another thinker will help us here,,and that's Luria.,Luria looked at people,just before they entered the scientific age,,and he found that these people,were resistant to classifying the concrete world.,They wanted to break it up,into little bits that they could use.,He found that they were resistant,to deducing the hypothetical,,to speculating about what might be,,and he found finally that they didn't deal well,with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions. 
 Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.,He talked to the head man of a person,in rural Russia.,They'd only had, as people had in 1900,,about four years of schooling.,And he asked that particular person,,what do crows and fish have in common?,And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.,You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.,A crow can peck at a fish.,A fish can't do anything to a crow.",And Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?",And he said, "Of course not.,One's a fish.,The other is a bird.",And he was interested, effectively,,in what he could do with those concrete objects. 
 And then Luria went to another person,,and he said to them,,"There are no camels in Germany.,Hamburg is a city in Germany.,Are there camels in Hamburg?",And the fellow said,,"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there.",And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?",And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,,and there's no room for camels.",In other words, he was unwilling to treat this,as anything but a concrete problem,,and he was used to camels being in villages,,and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,,to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany. 
 A third interview was conducted,with someone about the North Pole.,And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.,Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.,What color are the bears at the North Pole?",And the response was, "Such a thing,is to be settled by testimony.,If a wise person came from the North Pole,and told me the bears were white,,I might believe him,,but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear.",Now you see again, this person has rejected,going beyond the concrete world,and analyzing it through everyday experience,,and it was important to that person,what color bears were --,that is, they had to hunt bears.,They weren't willing to engage in this.,One of them said to Luria,,"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?,None of these problems are real.,How can we address them?" 
 Now, these three categories --,classification,,using logic on abstractions,,taking the hypothetical seriously --,how much difference do they make in the real world,beyond the testing room?,And let me give you a few illustrations. 
 First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.,That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education,to 12 years of formal education,,and 52 percent of Americans,have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.,Now, not only do we have much more education,,and much of that education is scientific,,and you can't do science without classifying the world.,You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.,You can't do science without making it logically consistent.,And even down in grade school, things have changed.,In 1910, they looked at the examinations,that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,,and they found that they were all,for socially valued concrete information.,They were things like,,what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states,that existed at that time?,When they looked at the exams,that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,,they were all about abstractions.,They were things like,,why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?,And you were supposed to think, well,,the state legislature was rural-controlled,,and they hated the big city,,so rather than putting the capital in a big city,,they put it in a county seat.,They put it in Albany rather than New York.,They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.,And so forth.,So the tenor of education has changed.,We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,,to use abstractions, and to link them logically. 
 What about employment?,Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans,practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.,Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.,Today, 35 percent of Americans,practice cognitively demanding professions,,not only to the professions proper like lawyer,or doctor or scientist or lecturer,,but many, many sub-professions,having to do with being a technician,,a computer programmer.,A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.,And we can only meet the terms of employment,in the modern world by being cognitively,far more flexible.,And it's not just that we have many more people,in cognitively demanding professions.,The professions have been upgraded.,Compare the doctor in 1900,,who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,,with the modern general practitioner or specialist,,with years of scientific training.,Compare the banker in 1900,,who really just needed a good accountant,and to know who was trustworthy in the local community,for paying back their mortgage.,Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees,may have been morally remiss,,but they were cognitively very agile.,They went far beyond that 1900 banker.,They had to look at computer projections,for the housing market.,They had to get complicated CDO-squared,in order to bundle debt together,and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.,They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies,to give it a AAA,,though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.,And they also, of course, had to get people,to accept these so-called assets,and pay money for them,even though they were highly vulnerable.,Or take a farmer today.,I take the farm manager of today as very different,from the farmer of 1900.,So it hasn't just been the spread,of cognitively demanding professions.,It's also been the upgrading of tasks,like lawyer and doctor and what have you,that have made demands on our cognitive faculties. 
 But I've talked about education and employment.,Some of the habits of mind that we have developed,over the 20th century,have paid off in unexpected areas.,I'm primarily a moral philosopher.,I merely have a holiday in psychology,,and what interests me in general is moral debate.,Now over the last century,,in developed nations like America,,moral debate has escalated,because we take the hypothetical seriously,,and we also take universals seriously,and look for logical connections.,When I came home in 1955 from university,at the time of Martin Luther King,,a lot of people came home at that time,and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.,My father was born in 1885,,and he was mildly racially biased.,As an Irishman, he hated the English so much,he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.,(Laughter),But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.,And when we said to our parents and grandparents,,"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?",they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.,Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --,(Laughter) --,that turned black? 
 In other words, they were fixed in the concrete,mores and attitudes they had inherited.,They would not take the hypothetical seriously,,and without the hypothetical,,it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.,You have to say, imagine you were,in Iran, and imagine that your relatives,all suffered from collateral damage,even though they had done no wrong.,How would you feel about that?,And if someone of the older generation says,,well, our government takes care of us,,and it's up to their government to take care of them,,they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.,Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,,and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.,Well, he's treating his mores,as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,,and they're unmovable in any way by logic.,They're just inherited mores.,Today we would say something like,,well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.,Would you deserve to be killed?,And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.,That's not one of the principles I've got.,Well you, today, universalize your principles.,You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.,If you have a principle such as,,people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,,then to exclude black people,you've got to make exceptions, don't you?,You have to say, well, blackness of skin,,you couldn't suffer just for that.,It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.,And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,,and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted,when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.,And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,,because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.,You're treating them as universals,,to be rendered consistent by logic. 
 Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?,That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.,If you look at the I.Q. test,,you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.,The similarities subtest of the Wechsler,is about classification,,and we have made enormous gains,on that classification subtest.,There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery,that are about using logic on abstractions.,Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,,and it's all about analogies.,And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.,That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.,What are dogs like?,They would say wolves.,But by 1960, people could attack Raven's,on a much more sophisticated level.,If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,,what follows two circles?,They could say a semicircle.,Just as a triangle is half of a square,,a semicircle is half of a circle.,By 2010, college graduates, if you said,two circles followed by a semicircle,,two sixteens followed by what,,they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.,That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world,that they could even ignore,the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question. 
 Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.,We haven't made progress on all fronts.,One of the ways in which we would like to deal,with the sophistication of the modern world,is through politics,,and sadly you can have humane moral principles,,you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,,and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,,you can't do politics.,We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,,that they read less history and less literature,and less material about foreign lands,,and they're essentially ahistorical.,They live in the bubble of the present.,They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.,They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.,Think how different America would be,if every American knew that this is the fifth time,Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,,and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened,on those four previous occasions.,(Laughter),And that is, they had barely left,,and there wasn't a trace in the sand.,Or imagine how different things would be,if most Americans knew that we had been lied,into four of our last six wars.,You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,,the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel,but was loaded with munitions,,the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,,and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda,and had nothing to do with it,,and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people,that they were brothers in arms,,when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost. 
 But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.,The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves,in ordinary people that we have now realized,,and the aristocracy was convinced,that the average person couldn't make it,,that they could never share their mindset,or their cognitive abilities.,Lord Curzon once said,he saw people bathing in the North Sea,,and he said, "Why did no one tell me,what white bodies the lower orders have?",As if they were a reptile.,Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling],[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady,are sisters underneath the skin." 
 (Applause)One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem,to go find a man I'd never met,but who had changed my life.,I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.,I didn't have an exact address,,but I knew his name, Abed,,I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,,and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,,he broke my neck.,And so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north,off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace. 
 The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.,I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,,heavy with four tons of floor tiles,,had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner,of the minibus where I sat.,I was then 19 years old.,I'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups,in eight months, and the night before the crash,,I delighted in my new body,,playing basketball with friends,into the wee hours of a May morning.,I palmed the ball in my large right hand,,and when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.,I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court. 
 I didn't see Abed coming.,From my seat, I was looking up at a stone town,on a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,,when from behind there was a great bang,,as loud and violent as a bomb.,My head snapped back over my red seat.,My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.,I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,,and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.,Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,,then to sit and to stand and to walk,,but my body was now divided vertically.,I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,,I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college. 
 College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.,There I rose from my chair for good,,I leaned on my cane, and I looked back,,finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus,to photographs of the crash,,and when I saw this photograph,,I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.,I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,,and I mourned that it was lost,,mourned all I had not yet done,,but was now impossible. 
 It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave,the morning after the crash,,of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.,Reading his words, I welled with anger.,It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,,and it came from magical thinking.,On this xeroxed piece of paper,,the crash had not yet happened.,Abed could still turn his wheel left,so that I would see him whoosh by out my window,and I would remain whole.,"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down.",But Abed did not slow,,and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,,and again, I was left without anger. 
 I decided to find Abed,,and when I finally did,,he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,,it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.,And maybe he had.,I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record --,27 violations by the age of 25,,the last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day —,and I didn't mention my prior record --,the quadriplegia and the catheters,,the insecurity and the loss —,and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,,I didn't say that I knew from the police report,that he'd escaped serious injury.,I said I wanted to meet.,Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks,,and when I did, and a recording told me,that his number was disconnected,,I let Abed and the crash go. 
 Many years passed.,I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack,on trips in six continents.,I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game,that I started in Central Park,,and home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,,typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.,A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories,mirrored my own, each centering on a life,that had changed in an instant,,owing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,,a swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.,Each of us had a before and an after.,I'd been working through my lot after all. 
 Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,,I returned to Israel to write of the crash,,and the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,",was nearly complete when I recognized,that I still wanted to meet Abed,,and finally I understood why:,to hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry.",People apologize for less.,And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived,somewhere in his same town,,and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,,when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.,But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?,(Laughter),I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,,and bought a brick of Turkish delight:,pistachios glued in rosewater. Better. 
 Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.,Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.,Abed would say, "I'm sorry.",I then began to wonder, as I had many times before,,how my life would have been different,had this man not injured me,,had my genes been fed a different helping of experience.,Who was I?,Was I who I had been before the crash,,before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?,Was I what had been done to me?,Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,,the infidelity of a parent or spouse,,money inherited?,Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?,It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,,but how to tease out the one from the other?,As Yeats put that same universal question,,"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,,how can we know the dancer from the dance?",I'd been driving for an hour,when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.,The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.,The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me,as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,,that had propelled me as a teen,to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.,But I also saw in my reflection,that, had Abed not injured me,,I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor,and a husband and a father.,I would be less mindful of time and of death,,and, oh, I would not be disabled,,would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.,The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth,come from biting at all the many things,a solitary hand cannot open.,The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined. 
 It was approaching 11 when I exited right,toward Afula, and passed a large quarry,and was soon in Kfar Kara.,I felt a pang of nerves.,But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,,and I pulled into a lot by a gas station,to listen and to calm. 
 I'd been told that in an Arab town,,one need only mention the name of a local,and it will be recognized.,And I was mentioning Abed and myself,,noting deliberately that I was here in peace,,to the people in this town,,when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.,He listened to me. 
 You know, it was most often when speaking to people,that I wondered where I ended and my disability began,,for many people told me what they told no one else.,Many cried.,And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same,and I later asked her why,,she told me that, best she could tell, her tears,had had something to do with my being happy and strong,,but vulnerable too.,I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.,I was me,,but I was now me despite a limp,,and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me. 
 Anyway, Mohamed told me,what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.,He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.,And as I sat contemplating what to say,,a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.,I stepped from my car and said "Shalom,",and identified myself,,and she told me that her husband Abed,would be home from work in four hours.,Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed,that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.,(Laughter) 
 I drove off and returned at 4:30,,thankful to the minaret up the road,that helped me find my way back.,And as I approached the front door,,Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,,and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.,He wore black and white: slippers over socks,,pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,,a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.,He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.,And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,,and I gave him my gift,,and he told me I was a guest in his home,,and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch. 
 It was then that Abed resumed at once,the tale of woe he had begun over the phone,16 years before.,He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.,He had problems with his side and his legs too,,and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.,Did I wish to see him remove them?,Abed then rose and turned on the TV,so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,,and returned with polaroids of the crash,and his old driver's license. 
 "I was handsome," he said. 
 We looked down at his laminated mug.,Abed had been less handsome than substantial,,with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.,It was this youth who on May 16, 1990,,had broken two necks including mine,,and bruised one brain and taken one life.,Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,,his skin slack on his face,,and looking at Abed looking at his young self,,I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self,after the crash, and recognized his longing. 
 "The crash changed both of our lives," I said. 
 Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,,and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver,in the left lane who did not let him pass.,I did not want to recap the crash with Abed.,I'd hoped for something simpler:,to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.,And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony,the morning after the crash,,Abed did not even mention the bus driver.,No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.,I had come for remorse.,And so I now went looking for remorse,and threw truth under the bus. 
 "I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,,but does it make you sad that others suffered?" 
 Abed spoke three quick words.,"Yes, I suffered." 
 Abed then told me why he'd suffered.,He'd lived an unholy life before the crash,,and so God had ordained the crash,,but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased. 
 It was then that God intervened:,news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before,had killed three people up north.,We looked up at the wreckage. 
 "Strange," I said. 
 "Strange," he agreed. 
 I had the thought that there, on Route 804,,there were perpetrators and victims,,dyads bound by a crash.,Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.,Some, as had I, would remember.,The report finished and Abed spoke. 
 "It is a pity," he said, "that the police,in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers." 
 I was baffled.,Abed had said something remarkable.,Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?,Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion,that he should have been put away longer?,He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.,I forgot my discretion. 
 "Um, Abed," I said,,"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash." 
 "Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40.",And so 27 violations --,driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,,driving on the wrong side of a barrier,,and finally, riding his brakes down that hill --,reduced to one. 
 And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,,the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.,The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.,It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize. 
 Abed and I sat with our coffee.,We'd spent 90 minutes together,,and he was now known to me.,He was not a particularly bad man,or a particularly good man.,He was a limited man,who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.,With a nod to Jewish custom,,he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.,But it was hard for me to relate to one who had,so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,,to one whose life was so unexamined that he said,he thought two people had died in the crash. 
 There was much I wished to say to Abed.,I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,,it would be okay,,for people are wrong to marvel,at those like me who smile as we limp.,People don't know that they have lived through worse,,that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,,that problems of the mind are greater still,,more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.,I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are,most of all,is not our minds and not our bodies,and not what happens to us,,but how we respond to what happens to us.,"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,,"is the last of the human freedoms:,to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.",I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers,and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,,but we all must --,the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding,and the bankrupt and everyone.,I wished to tell him that one does not have to say,that a bad thing is good,,that a crash is from God and so a crash is good,,a broken neck is good.,One can say that a bad thing sucks,,but that this natural world still has many glories.,I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:,We have to rise above bad fortune.,We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,,study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship --,and community and love. 
 But most of all, I wished to tell him,what Herman Melville wrote,,that "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,,some small part of you must be cold,,for there is no quality in this world,that is not what it is merely by contrast.",Yes, contrast.,If you are mindful of what you do not have,,you may be truly mindful of what you do have,,and if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.,That is the one singular gift you may receive,if you suffer in any existential way.,You know death, and so may wake each morning,pulsing with ready life.,Some part of you is cold,,and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,,or even to be cold.,When one morning, years after the crash,,I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot,felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,,it was exhilarating, a gust of snow. 
 But I didn't say these things to Abed.,I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.,I told him the name of that man.,And then I said, "Goodbye." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thanks a lot.,(Applause)There's something that I'd like you to see. 
 (Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled,millions in China:,footage of a two-year-old girl,hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,,footage too graphic to be shown.,The entire accident is caught on camera.,The driver pauses after hitting the child,,his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.,Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.,The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.,Others look at her before moving off. 
 Peter Singer: There were other people,who walked past Wang Yue,,and a second van ran over her legs,before a street cleaner raised the alarm.,She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died. 
 I wonder how many of you, looking at that,,said to yourselves just now, "I would not have done that.,I would have stopped to help.",Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. 
 As I thought, that's most of you.,And I believe you. I'm sure you're right.,But before you give yourself too much credit,,look at this.,UNICEF reports that in 2011,,6.9 million children under five,died from preventable, poverty-related diseases.,UNICEF thinks that that's good news,because the figure has been steadily coming down,from 12 million in 1990. That is good.,But still, 6.9 million,is 19,000 children dying every day.,Does it really matter,that we're not walking past them in the street?,Does it really matter that they're far away?,I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.,The fact that they're not right in front of us,,the fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality,or race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.,What is really important is,,can we reduce that death toll? Can we save,some of those 19,000 children dying every day? 
 And the answer is, yes we can.,Each of us spends money,on things that we do not really need.,You can think what your own habit is,,whether it's a new car, a vacation,or just something like buying bottled water,when the water that comes out of the tap,is perfectly safe to drink.,You could take the money you're spending,on those unnecessary things,and give it to this organization,,the Against Malaria Foundation,,which would take the money you had given,and use it to buy nets like this one,to protect children like this one,,and we know reliably that if we provide nets,,they're used, and they reduce the number of children,dying from malaria,,just one of the many preventable diseases,that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children,dying every day. 
 Fortunately, more and more people,are understanding this idea,,and the result is a growing movement:,effective altruism.,It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.,The heart, of course, you felt.,You felt the empathy for that child.,But it's really important to use the head as well,to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,,and not only that, but also I think reason helps us,to understand that other people, wherever they are,,are like us, that they can suffer as we can,,that parents grieve for the deaths of their children,,as we do,,and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,,it matters just as much to all of these people.,So I think reason is not just some neutral tool,to help you get whatever you want.,It does help us to put perspective on our situation.,And I think that's why,many of the most significant people in effective altruism,have been people who have had backgrounds,in philosophy or economics or math.,And that might seem surprising,,because a lot of people think,,"Philosophy is remote from the real world;,economics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,,and we know that math is for nerds.",But in fact it does make a difference,,and in fact there's one particular nerd,who has been a particularly effective altruist,because he got this. 
 This is the website of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,,and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,,it says, "All lives have equal value.",That's the understanding,,the rational understanding of our situation in the world,that has led to these people,being the most effective altruists in history,,Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. 
 (Applause) 
 No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,,has ever given as much to charity,as each one of these three,,and they have used their intelligence,to make sure that it is highly effective.,According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation,has already saved 5.8 million lives,and many millions more, people, getting diseases,that would have made them very sick,,even if eventually they survived.,Over the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation,is going to give a lot more,,is going to save a lot more lives.,Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,,you can have that kind of impact.,But if I'm not, what can I do?,So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask,that maybe stand in the way of them giving. 
 They worry how much of a difference they can make.,But you don't have to be a billionaire.,This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy,at the University of Oxford.,He became an effective altruist when he calculated,that with the money that he was likely to earn,throughout his career, an academic career,,he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness,in developing countries,and still have enough left,for a perfectly adequate standard of living.,So Toby founded an organization,called Giving What We Can to spread this information,,to unite people who want to share some of their income,,and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent,of what they earn over their lifetime,to fighting global poverty.,Toby himself does better than that.,He's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year --,that's less than 30,000 dollars --,and to give the rest to those organizations.,And yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage. 
 This is a couple at a later stage of life,,Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott,,who, when they were young, when they met,,were activists against the Vietnam War,,fought for social justice,,and then moved into careers, as most people do,,didn't really do anything very active about those values,,although they didn't abandon them.,And then, as they got to the age at which many people,start to think of retirement, they returned to them,,and they've decided to cut back on their spending,,to live modestly, and to give both money and time,to helping to fight global poverty. 
 Now, mentioning time might lead you to think,,"Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time,into saving some of these 19,000 lives,that are lost every day?",One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue,of how you can have a career that will have,the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.,He's a graduate student in philosophy,,and he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,,the number of hours he estimates,most people spend on their career,,to advise people on how to have the best,,most effective career.,But you might be surprised to know,that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,,if they have the right abilities and character,,is to go into banking or finance.,Why? Because if you earn a lot of money,,you can give away a lot of money,,and if you're successful in that career,,you could give enough to an aid organization,so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers,in developing countries, and each one of them,would probably do about as much good,as you would have done.,So you can quintuple the impact,by leading that kind of career.,Here's one young man who's taken this advice.,His name is Matt Weiger.,He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,,actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis,last year when he graduated.,But he's gone into finance in New York.,He's already earning enough,so that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities,and still leaving himself with enough to live on.,Matt has also helped me to set up an organization,that I'm working with that has the name taken,from the title of a book I wrote,,"The Life You Can Save,",which is trying to change our culture,so that more people think that,if we're going to live an ethical life,,it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots,and not cheat, steal, maim, kill,,but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that,with people who have so little.,And the organization draws together people,of different generations,,like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,,who's pledged to give 10 percent,of the little amount that she has,,and on the right, Ada Wan,,who has worked directly for the poor, but has now,gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give. 
 Many people will think, though,,that charities aren't really all that effective.,So let's talk about effectiveness.,Toby Ord is very concerned about this,,and he's calculated that some charities,are hundreds or even thousands of times,more effective than others,,so it's very important to find the effective ones.,Take, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.,That's a good thing to do, right?,Well, right, it is a good thing to do,,but you have to think what else you could do with the resources.,It costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog,and train the recipient so that the guide dog,can be an effective help to a blind person.,It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars,to cure a blind person in a developing country,if they have trachoma.,So you do the sums, and you get something like that.,You could provide one guide dog,for one blind American,,or you could cure between 400,and 2,000 people of blindness.,I think it's clear what's the better thing to do.,But if you want to look for effective charities,,this is a good website to go to.,GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,,not just whether they're well-run,,and it's screened hundreds of charities,and currently is recommending only three,,of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.,So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,,thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can,both have a somewhat broader list,,but you can find effective organizations,,and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.,I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website,looking at effective animal organizations.,That's another cause that I've been concerned about,all my life, the immense amount of suffering,that humans inflict,on literally tens of billions of animals every year.,So if you want to look for effective organizations,to reduce that suffering,,you can go to Effective Animal Activism.,And some effective altruists think it's very important,to make sure that our species survives at all.,So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.,Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of,recently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.,Possibly research could help us not only to predict,the path of asteroids that might collide with us,,but actually to deflect them.,So some people think that would be a good thing to give to.,There's many possibilities. 
 My final question is,,some people will think it's a burden to give.,I don't really believe it is.,I've enjoyed giving all of my life,since I was a graduate student.,It's been something fulfilling to me.,Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.,He thinks that the life he's saving is his own.,And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression,until she got involved with effective altruism,,and now is one of the happiest people she knows.,I think one of the reasons for this,is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome,what I call the Sisyphus problem.,Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,,condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder,up to the top of the hill.,Just as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,,the boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,,he has to trudge back down to push it up again,,and the same thing happens again and again,for all eternity.,Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,,where you work hard to get money,,you spend that money on consumer goods,which you hope you'll enjoy using?,But then the money's gone, you have to work hard,to get more, spend more, and to maintain,the same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.,You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.,Becoming an effective altruist gives you,that meaning and fulfillment.,It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem,on which you can feel your life was really worth living. 
 I'm going to conclude by telling you,about an email that I received,while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.,It's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.,This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.,Why was he recovering from surgery? 
 The email began, "Last Tuesday,,I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.,That started a kidney chain,which enabled four people to receive kidneys." 
 There's about 100 people each year in the U.S.,and more in other countries who do that.,I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say,that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.,Well, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,,because I still have two kidneys.,But Chris went on to say that he didn't think,that what he'd done was all that amazing,,because he calculated that the number of life-years,that he had added to people, the extension of life,,was about the same that you could achieve,if you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.,And that did make me feel a little bit better,,because I have given more than 5,000 dollars,to the Against Malaria Foundation,and to various other effective charities. 
 So if you're feeling bad,because you still have two kidneys as well,,there's a way for you to get off the hook. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I had brain surgery 18 years ago,,and since that time, brain science has become,a personal passion of mine.,I'm actually an engineer.,And first let me say, I recently joined,Google's Moonshot group,,where I had a division,,the display division in Google X,,and the brain science work I'm speaking about today,is work I did before I joined Google,and on the side outside of Google. 
 So that said, there's a stigma,when you have brain surgery.,Are you still smart or not?,And if not, can you make yourself smart again? 
 After my neurosurgery,,part of my brain was missing,,and I had to deal with that.,It wasn't the grey matter, but it nwas the gooey part dead center,that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.,Immediately after my surgery,,I had to decide what amounts of each of over,a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,,because if I just took nothing,,I would die within hours.,Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --,I've had to try to decide the combinations,and mixtures of chemicals,,and try to get them, to stay alive.,There have been several close calls. 
 But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,,so I decided I would experiment,to try to find more optimal dosages,because there really isn't a clear road map,on this that's detailed.,I began to try different mixtures,,and I was blown away by how,tiny changes in dosages,dramatically changed my sense of self,,my sense of who I was, my thinking,,my behavior towards people.,One particularly dramatic case:,for a couple months I actually tried dosages,and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,,and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.,(Laughter),I was angry all the time,,I thought about sex constantly,,and I thought I was the smartest person,in the entire world, and,—(Laughter)—,of course over the years I'dnmet guys kind of like that,,or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.,I was kind of extreme.,But to me, the surprise was,,I wasn't trying to be arrogant.,I was actually trying,,with a little bit of insecurity,,to actually fix a problem in front of me,,and it just didn't come out that way. 
 So I couldn't handle it.,I changed my dosages.,But that experience, I think, gave me,a new appreciation for men,and what they might walk through,,and I've gotten along with men,a lot better since then. 
 What I was trying to do,with tuning these hormones,and neurotransmitters and so forth,was to try to get my intelligence back,after my illness and surgery,,my creative thought, my idea flow.,And I think mostly in images,,and so for me that became a key metric --,how to get these mental images,that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,,if you will, my ideas,,trying on different new ideas for size,,playing out scenarios.,This kind of thinking isn't new.,Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes,saw things similarly.,They thought that mental images and ideas,were actually the same thing.,There are those today that dispute that,,and lots of debates about how the mind works,,but for me it's simple:,Mental images, for most of us,,are central in inventive and creative thinking. 
 So after several years,,I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,,really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication,and the analytical backbone behind them.,And so now I'm working on,,how can I get these mental images in my mind,out to my computer screen faster?,Can you imagine, if you will,,a movie director being able to use,her imagination alone tondirect the world in front of her?,Or a musician to get the music out of his head?,There are incredible possibilities with this,as a way for creative people,to share at light speed.,And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck,in being able to do this,is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems. 
 So let me show you why I think nwe're pretty close to getting there,by sharing with you two recent experiments,from two top neuroscience groups.,Both used fMRI technology --,functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --,to image the brain,,and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis,and his colleagues at Harvard.,And the left-hand column shows a brain scan,of a person looking at an image.,The middle column shows the brainscan,of that same individual,imagining, seeing that same image.,And the right column was created,by subtracting the middle ncolumn from the left column,,showing the difference to be nearly zero.,This was repeated on lots of different individuals,with lots of different images,,always with a similar result.,The difference between seeing an image,and imagining seeing that same image,is next to nothing. 
 Next let me share with you one other experiment,,this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.,They've been able to decode brainwaves,into recognizable visual fields.,So let me set this up for you.,In this experiment, individuals were shown,hundreds of hours of YouTube videos,while scans were made of their brains,to create a large library of their brain reacting,to video sequences.,Then a new movie was shown with new images,,new people, new animals in it,,and a new scan set was recorded.,The computer, using brain scan data alone,,decoded that new brain scan,to show what it thought the nindividual was actually seeing.,On the right-hand side, younsee the computer's guess,,and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.,This is the jaw-dropper.,We are so close to being able to do this.,We just need to up the resolution.,And now remember that when you see an image,versus when you imagine that same image,,it creates the same brain scan. 
 So this was done with the highest-resolution,brain scan systems available today,,and their resolution has increased really,about a thousandfold in the last several years.,Next we need to increase the resolution,another thousandfold,to get a deeper glimpse.,How do we do that?,There's a lot of techniques in this approach.,One way is to crack open yournskull and put in electrodes.,I'm not for that.,There's a lot of new imaging techniques,being proposed, some even by me,,but given the recent success of MRI,,first we need to ask the question,,is it the end of the road with this technology?,Conventional wisdom says the only way,to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,,but at this point bigger magnets,only offer incremental resolution improvements,,not the thousandfold we need.,I'm putting forward an idea:,instead of bigger magnets,,let's make better magnets.,There's some new technology breakthroughs,in nanoscience,when applied to magnetic structures,that have created a whole new class of magnets,,and with these magnets, we can lay down,very fine detailed magnetic field patterns,throughout the brain,,and using those, we can actually create,holographic-like interference structures,to get precision control over many patterns,,as is shown here by shifting things.,We can create much more complicated structures,with slightly different arrangements,,kind of like making Spirograph. 
 So why does that matter?,A lot of effort in MRI over the years,has gone into making really big,,really huge magnets, right?,But yet most of the recent advances,in resolution have actually come from,ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions,in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers,in the MRI systems.,Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,,put down structured magnetic patterns,in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.,So by combining the magnetics patterns,with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies,processing which can massively increase,the information that we can extract,in a single scan.,And on top of that, we can then layer,our ever-growing knowledge nof brain structure and memory,to create a thousandfold increase that we need.,And using fMRI, we should be able to measure,not just oxygenated blood flow,,but the hormones and neurotransmitters nI've talked about,and maybe even the direct neural activity,,which is the dream. 
 We're going to be able to dump our ideas,directly to digital media.,Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language,and communicate directly with human thought?,What would we be capable of then?,And how will we learn to deal,with the truths of unfiltered human thought?,You think the Internet was big.,These are huge questions.,It might be irresistible as a tool,to amplify our thinking and communication skills.,And indeed, this very same tool,may prove to lead to the cure,for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. 
 We have little option but to open this door.,Regardless, pick a year --,will it happen in five years or 15 years?,It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.,We need to learn how to take this step together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)To give me an idea of how many of you here,may find what I'm about to tell you,of practical value,,let me ask you please to raise your hands:,Who here is either over 65 years old,or hopes to live past age 65,or has parents or grandparents who did live,or have lived past 65,,raise your hands please. (Laughter) 
 Okay. You are the people to whom my talk,will be of practical value. (Laughter),The rest of you,won't find my talk personally relevant,,but I think that you will still find the subject,fascinating. 
 I'm going to talk about growing older,in traditional societies.,This subject constitutes just one chapter,of my latest book, which compares,traditional, small, tribal societies,with our large, modern societies,,with respect to many topics,such as bringing up children,,growing older, health, dealing with danger,,settling disputes, religion,and speaking more than one language. 
 Those tribal societies, which constituted,all human societies for most of human history,,are far more diverse than are our modern,,recent, big societies.,All big societies that have governments,,and where most people are strangers to each other,,are inevitably similar to each other,and different from tribal societies.,Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments,in how to run a human society.,They constitute experiments from which we ourselves,may be able to learn.,Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned,as primitive and miserable,,but also they shouldn't be romanticized,as happy and peaceful.,When we learn of tribal practices,,some of them will horrify us,,but there are other tribal practices which,,when we hear about them,,we may admire and envy,and wonder whether we could adopt those practices,ourselves. 
 Most old people in the U.S. end up living,separately from their children,and from most of their friends,of their earlier years,,and often they live in separatenretirements homes for the elderly,,whereas in traditional societies,,older people instead live out their lives,among their children, their other relatives,,and their lifelong friends.,Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly,varies enormously among traditional societies,,from much worse to much better,than in our modern societies. 
 At the worst extreme, many traditional societies,get rid of their elderly,in one of four increasingly direct ways:,by neglecting their elderly,and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,,or by abandoning them when the group moves,,or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,,or by killing older people.,In which tribal societies do children,abandon or kill their parents?,It happens mainly under two conditions.,One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies,that often shift camp,and that are physically incapable,of transporting old people who can't walk,when the able-bodied younger people already,have to carry their young children,and all their physical possessions.,The other condition is in societies,living in marginal or fluctuating environments,,such as the Arctic or deserts,,where there are periodic food shortages,,and occasionally there just isn't enough food,to keep everyone alive.,Whatever food is available has to be reserved,for able-bodied adults and for children.,To us Americans, it sounds horrible,to think of abandoning or killing,your own sick wife or husband,or elderly mother or father,,but what could those traditional societies,do differently?,They face a cruel situation of no choice.,Their old people had to do it to their own parents,,and the old people know,what now is going to happen to them. 
 At the opposite extreme,in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,,are the New Guinea farming societies,where I've been doing my fieldwork nfor the past 50 years,,and most other sedentary traditional societies,around the world.,In those societies, older people are cared for.,They are fed. They remain valuable.,And they continue to live in the same hut,or else in a nearby hut near their children,,relatives and lifelong friends. 
 There are two main sets of reasons for this variation,among societies in their treatment,of old people.,The variation depends especially,on the usefulness of old people,and on the society's values. 
 First, as regards usefulness,,older people continue to perform useful services.,One use of older people in traditional societies,is that they often are still effective,at producing food.,Another traditional usefulness of older people,is that they are capable of babysitting,their grandchildren,,thereby freeing up their own adult children,,the parents of those grandchildren,,to go hunting and gatheringnfood for the grandchildren.,Still another traditional value of older people,is in making tools, weapons, baskets,,pots and textiles.,In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.,Older people usually are the leaders,of traditional societies,,and the people most knowledgeable about politics,,medicine, religion, songs and dances. 
 Finally, older people in traditional societies,have a huge significance that would never occur,to us in our modern, literate societies,,where our sources of information are books,and the Internet.,In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,,older people are the repositories of information.,It's their knowledge that spells the difference,between survival and death for their whole society,in a time of crisis caused by rare events,for which only the oldest people alive,have had experience.,Those, then, are the ways in which older people,are useful in traditional societies.,Their usefulness varies and contributes,to variation in the society's treatment,of the elderly. 
 The other set of reasons for variation,in the treatment of the elderly is,the society's cultural values.,For example, there's particular emphasis,on respect for the elderly in East Asia,,associated with Confucius' doctrine,of filial piety, which means obedience,,respect and support for elderly parents.,Cultural values that emphasizenrespect for older people,contrast with the low status of the elderly,in the U.S.,Older Americans are at a big disadvantage,in job applications.,They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.,Our hospitals have an explicit policy,called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.,That sinister expression means that,if hospital resources are limited,,for example if only one donor heart,becomes available for transplant,,or if a surgeon has time to operate,on only a certain number of patients,,American hospitals have an explicit policy,of giving preference to younger patients,over older patients,on the grounds that younger patients are considered,more valuable to society,because they have more years of life ahead of them,,even though the younger patients have fewer years,of valuable life experience behind them.,There are several reasons for this low status,of the elderly in the U.S.,One is our Protestant work ethic,which places high value on work,,so older people who are no longer working,aren't respected.,Another reason is our American emphasis,on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,,so we instinctively look down on older people,who are no longer self-reliant and independent.,Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,,which shows up even in our advertisements.,Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict,smiling young people,,even though old as well as young people,buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.,Just think, what's the last time you saw,a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people,85 years old? Never.,Instead, the only American ads,featuring white-haired old people,are ads for retirement homes and pension planning. 
 Well, what has changed in the status,of the elderly today,compared to their status in traditional societies?,There have been a few changes for the better,and more changes for the worse.,Big changes for the better,include the fact that today we enjoy,much longer lives,,much better health in our old age,,and much better recreational opportunities.,Another change for the better is that we now have,specialized retirement facilities,and programs to take care of old people.,Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality,that we now have,more old people and fewer young people,than at any time in the past.,That means that all those old people,are more of a burden on the few young people,,and that each old person has less individual value.,Another big change for the worsenin the status of the elderly,is the breaking of social ties with age,,because older people, their children,,and their friends,,all move and scatter independently of each other,many times during their lives.,We Americans move on the average,every five years.,Hence our older people are likely,to end up living distant from their children,and the friends of their youth.,Yet another change for the worsenin the status of the elderly,is formal retirement from the workforce,,carrying with it a loss of work friendships,and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.,Perhaps the biggest change for the worse,is that our elderly are objectively,less useful than in traditional societies.,Widespread literacy means that they are no longer,useful as repositories of knowledge.,When we want some information,,we look it up in a book or we Google it,instead of finding some old person to ask.,The slow pace of technological change,in traditional societies,means that what someone learns there as a child,is still useful when that person is old,,but the rapid pace of technological change today,means that what we learn as children,is no longer useful 60 years later.,And conversely, we older people are not fluent,in the technologies essential for surviving,in modern society.,For example, as a 15-year-old,,I was considered outstandinglyngood at multiplying numbers,because I had memorized the multiplication tables,and I know how to use logarithms,and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.,Today, though, those skills are utterly useless,because any idiot,can now multiply eight-digit numbers,accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.,Conversely, I at age 75,am incompetent at skills,essential for everyday life.,My family's first TV set in 1948,had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:,an on-off switch, a volume knob,,and a channel selector knob.,Today, just to watch a program,on the TV set in my own house,,I have to operate a 41-button TV remote,that utterly defeats me.,I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons,and ask them to talk me through it,while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons. 
 What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly,in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?,That's a huge problem.,In my remaining four minutes today,,I can offer just a few suggestions.,One value of older people is that they are,increasingly useful as grandparents,for offering high-quality childcare,to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,,as more young women enter the workforce,and as fewer young parents of either gender,stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.,Compared to the usual alternatives,of paid babysitters and day care centers,,grandparents offer superior, motivated,,experienced child care.,They've already gained experiencenfrom raising their own children.,They usually love their grandchildren,,and are eager to spend time with them.,Unlike other caregivers,,grandparents don't quit their job,because they found another job with higher pay,looking after another baby.,A second value of older people is paradoxically,related to their loss of value,as a result of changing worldnconditions and technology.,At the same time, older people have gained,in value today precisely because,of their unique experience of living conditions,that have now become rare,because of rapid change, but that could come back.,For example, only Americans now in their 70s,or older today can remember,the experience of living through a great depression,,the experience of living through a world war,,and agonizing whether or not,dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible,than the likely consequencesnof not dropping atomic bombs.,Most of our current voters and politicians,have no personal experience of any of those things,,but millions of older Americans do.,Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations,could come back.,Even if they don't come back,,we have to be able to plan for them,on the basis of the experience of what they were like.,Older people have that experience.,Younger people don't. 
 The remaining value of older people,that I'll mention involves recognizing that,while there are many things that older people,can no longer do,,there are other things that they can do,better than younger people.,A challenge for society is nto make use of those things,that older people are better at doing.,Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.,Those include abilities at tasks,requiring physical strength and stamina,,ambition, and the power of novel reasoning,in a circumscribed situation,,such as figuring out the structure of DNA,,best left to scientists under the age of 30.,Conversely, valuable attributes,that increase with age include experience,,understanding of people and human relationships,,ability to help other people,without your own ego getting in the way,,and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,,such as economics and comparative history,,best left to scholars over the age of 60.,Hence older people arenmuch better than younger people,at supervising, administering, advising,,strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,,and devising long-term plans.,I've seen this value of older people,with so many of my friends in their 60s,,70s, 80s and 90s,,who are still active as investment managers,,farmers, lawyers and doctors.,In short, many traditional societies,make better use of their elderly,and give their elderly more satisfying lives,than we do in modern, big societies. 
 Paradoxically nowadays,,when we have more elderly people than ever before,,living healthier lives and with better medical care,than ever before,,old age is in some respects more miserable,than ever before.,The lives of the elderly are widely recognized,as constituting a disaster area,of modern American society.,We can surely do better by learning,from the lives of the elderly,in traditional societies.,But what's true of the lives of the elderly,in traditional societies,is true of many other features,of traditional societies as well.,Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up,agriculture and metal tools,and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.,There are many obvious respects,in which our lives today are far happier,than those in small, traditional societies.,To mention just a few examples,,our lives are longer, materially much richer,,and less plagued by violence,than are the lives of people in traditional societies.,But there are also things to be admired,about people in traditional societies,,and perhaps to be learned from them.,Their lives are usually socially much richer,than our lives,,although materially poorer.,Their children are more self-confident,,more independent, and more socially skilled,than are our children.,They think more realisticallynabout dangers than we do.,They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,,stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases,that will be the causes of death of almost,all of us in this room today.,Features of the modern lifestylenpredispose us to those diseases,,and features of the traditional lifestyle,protect us against them. 
 Those are just some examples of what we can learn,from traditional societies.,I hope that you will find it as fascinating,to read about traditional societies,as I found it to live in those societies. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was a young boy,,I used to gaze through the microscope of my father,at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.,And they were remarkably well preserved,,morphologically just phenomenal.,And we used to imagine that someday,,they would actually come to life,and they would crawl out of the resin,,and, if they could, they would fly away. 
 If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not,we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,,I would have told you, it's unlikely.,If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able,to revive an extinct species,,I would have said, pipe dream.,But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,,to tell you that not only is the sequencing,of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,,but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,,maybe not from the insects in amber --,in fact, this mosquito was actually used,for the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" —,but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains,of woolly mammoths in the permafrost. 
 Woollies are a particularly interesting,,quintessential image of the Ice Age.,They were large. They were hairy.,They had large tusks, and we seem to have,a very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.,Maybe it's because elephants share,many things in common with us.,They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.,They have social knits that are very close.,Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,,because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa,some seven million years ago,,and as habitats changed and environments changed,,we actually, like the elephants, migrated out,into Europe and Asia. 
 So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene,is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall,weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species,and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,,across the Bering land bridge,and into parts of North America.,And then, again, as climate changed as it always does,,and new habitats opened up,,we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species,called trogontherii in Central Asia,pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.,And the open grassland savannas of North America,opened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,,a large, hairless species in North America.,And it was really only about 500,000 years later,that we had the arrival of the woolly,,the one that we all know and love so much,,spreading from an East Beringian point of origin,across Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii,out through Central Europe,,and over hundreds of thousands of years,migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge,during times of glacial peaks,and coming into direct contact,with the Columbian relatives living in the south,,and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years,during traumatic climatic shifts.,So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions,in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.,And there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,,and actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia,and Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.,So Egyptians are building pyramids,and woollies are still living on islands. 
 And then they disappear.,Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,,they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate,and fast-encroaching dense forests,that are migrating north,,and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,,probably Pleistocene overkill,,so the large game hunters that took them down. 
 Fortunately, we find millions of their remains,strewn across the permafrost buried deep,in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there,and actually take them out.,And the preservation is, again,,like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.,So you have teeth, bones with blood,which look like blood, you have hair,,and you have intact carcasses or heads,which still have brains in them. 
 So the preservation and the survival of DNA,depends on many factors, and I have to admit,,most of which we still don't quite understand,,but depending upon when an organism dies,and how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,,the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,,will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive,over geologically meaningful time frames.,And it's probably surprising to many of you,sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,,it's not the length of preservation,,it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most. 
 So if we were to go deep now within the bones,and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,,the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped,around histone proteins, is now under attack,by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth,for years during its lifetime.,So those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,,free water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA,into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,,until all you have are fragments that range,from 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,,a few hundred base pairs in length.,So most fossils out there in the fossil record,are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.,But a few of them actually have DNA fragments,that survive for thousands,,even a few millions of years in time.,And using state-of-the-art clean room technology,,we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs,away from all the rest of the gunk in there,,and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room,that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth,and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,,but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,,and, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA,that survived in that environment with it,,so the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.,Not surprising then again that a mammoth,preserved in the permafrost will have something,on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,,whereas something like the Columbian mammoth,,living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment,over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous. 
 But we've come up with very clever ways,that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,,the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,,and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,,we can actually pull out and bioinformatically,re-jig all these small mammoth fragments,and place them onto a backbone,of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.,And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points,that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,,and what do we know, then, about a mammoth? 
 Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,,and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.,So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,,but an elephant and mammoth genome,is about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that,is composed of small, repetitive DNAs,that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome. 
 So having this information allows us to answer,one of the interesting relationship questions,between mammoths and their living relatives,,the African and the Asian elephant,,all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,,but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share,a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants,about six million years ago,,so slightly closer to the Asian elephant. 
 With advances in ancient DNA technology,,we can actually now start to begin to sequence,the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,,and I just wanted to talk about two of them,,the woolly and the Columbian mammoth,,both of which were living very close to each other,during glacial peaks,,so when the glaciers were massive in North America,,the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,,and came into contact with the relatives living to the south,,and there they shared refugia,,and a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.,It looks like they were interbreeding.,And that this is not an uncommon feature,in Proboscideans, because it turns out,that large savanna male elephants will outcompete,the smaller forest elephants for their females.,So large, hairless Columbians,outcompeting the smaller male woollies.,It reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is not trivial, given the idea that we want,to revive extinct species, because it turns out,that an African and an Asian elephant,can actually interbreed and have live young,,and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo,in Chester, U.K., in 1978.,So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,,modify them into all those positions we've actually now,been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,,we can put that into an enucleated cell,,differentiate that into a stem cell,,subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,,artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,,and over a long and arduous procedure,,actually bring back something that looks like this.,Now, this wouldn't be an exact replica,,because the short DNA fragments that I told you about,will prevent us from building the exact structure,,but it would make something that looked and felt,very much like a woolly mammoth did. 
 Now, when I bring up this with my friends,,we often talk about, well, where would you put it?,Where are you going to house a mammoth?,There's no climates or habitats suitable.,Well, that's not actually the case.,It turns out that there are swaths of habitat,in the north of Siberia and Yukon,that actually could house a mammoth.,Remember, this was a highly plastic animal,that lived over tremendous climate variation.,So this landscape would be easily able to house it,,and I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,,the boy in me, that would love to see,these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost,of the north once again, but I do have to admit,that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders,whether or not we should. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Ryan Phelan: Don't go away.,You've left us with a question.,I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?",it feels like you're reticent there,,and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.,What's your reticence? 
 Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.,I think it's just that we have to think very deeply,about the implications, ramifications of our actions,,and so as long as we have good, deep discussion,like we're having now, I think,we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.,But I just want to make sure that we spend time,thinking about why we're doing it first. 
 RP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik. 
 HP: Thank you. (Applause)I do want to test this questionnwe're all interested in:,Does extinction have to be forever? 
 I'm focused on two projectsnI want to tell you about.,One is the Thylacine Project.,The other one is the Lazarus Project,,and that's focusednon the gastric-brooding frog.,And it would be a fair question to ask,,why have we focused on these two animals?,Well, point number one, each of themnrepresents a unique family of its own.,We've lost a whole family.,That's a big chunknof the global genome gone.,I'd like it back.,The second reasonnis that we killed these things.,In the case of the thylacine, regrettably,nwe shot every one that we saw.,We slaughtered them.,In the case of the gastric-brooding frog,nwe may have "fungicided" it to death.,There's a dreadful fungusnthat's moving through the world,that's called the chytrid fungus,,and it's nailing frogs all over the world.,We think that's probablynwhat got this frog,,and humans are spreading this fungus. 
 And this introducesna very important ethical point,,and I think you will have heardnthis many times,when this topic comes up.,What I think is important,is that, if it's clearnthat we exterminated these species,,then I think we not onlynhave a moral obligation,to see what we can do about it,,but I think we've got a moral imperativento try to do something, if we can. 
 OK. Let me talk to younabout the Lazarus Project.,It's a frog. And you think, frog.,Yeah, but this was not just any frog.,Unlike a normal frog,nwhich lays its eggs in the water,and goes awaynand wishes its froglets well,,this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,,swallowed them into the stomach,nwhere it should be having food,,didn't digest the eggs,nand turned its stomach into a uterus.,In the stomach, the eggsnwent on to develop into tadpoles,,and in the stomach, the tadpolesnwent on to develop into frogs,,and they grew in the stomach,until eventually the poor old frognwas at risk of bursting apart.,It has a little cough and a hiccup,nand out comes sprays of little frogs. 
 Now, when biologists saw this,nthey were agog.,They thought, this is incredible.,No animal, let alone a frog,nhas been known to do this,,to change one organnin the body into another.,And you can imagine the medical worldnwent nuts over this as well.,If we could understand,how that frog is managingnthe way its tummy works,,is there information herenthat we need to understand,or could usefully use to help ourselves?,Now, I'm not suggesting we wantnto raise our babies in our stomach,,but I am suggesting it's possible,we might want to managengastric secretion in the gut.,And just as everybodyngot excited about it, bang!,It was extinct. 
 I called up my friend,,Professor Mike Tylernin the University of Adelaide.,He was the last person who had this frog,na colony of these things, in his lab.,And I said, "Mike, by any chance --"nThis was 30 or 40 years ago.,"By any chance had you keptnany frozen tissue of this frog?",And he thought about it,,and he went to his deep freezer,nminus 20 degrees centigrade,,and he poured throughneverything in the freezer,,and there in the bottom was a jarnand it contained tissues of these frogs. 
 This was very exciting,,but there was no reasonnwhy we should expect that this would work,,because this tissuenhad not had any antifreeze put in it,,cryoprotectants, to look after itnwhen it was frozen.,And normally, when water freezes,nas you know, it expands,,and the same thing happens in a cell.,If you freeze tissues, the water expands,ndamages or bursts the cell walls.,Well, we looked at the tissuenunder the microscope.,It actually didn't look bad.nThe cell walls looked intact.,So we thought, let's give it a go. 
 What we did is something callednsomatic cell nuclear transplantation.,We took the eggsnof a related species, a living frog,,and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.,We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.,And then we took the dead nucleusnfrom the dead tissue of the extinct frog,and we inserted those nucleininto that egg.,Now, by rights, this isnkind of like a cloning project,,like what produced Dolly,,but it's actually very different,,because Dolly was live sheepninto live sheep cells.,That was a miracle, but it was workable.,What we're trying to do is takena dead nucleus from an extinct species,and put it into a completely differentnspecies and expect that to work.,Well, we had no real reasonnto expect it would,,and we tried hundredsnand hundreds of these.,And just last February,nthe last time we did these trials, 
 I saw a miracle starting to happen.,What we found wasnmost of these eggs didn't work,,but then suddenly,none of them began to divide.,That was so exciting.,And then the egg divided again.nAnd then again.,And pretty soon,nwe had early-stage embryos,with hundreds of cells forming those.,We even DNA-tested some of these cells,,and the DNA of the extinct frognis in those cells.,So we're very excited.nThis is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.,But it's a long way along the journey,to producing, or bringing back,nan extinct species.,And this is news.,We haven't announced this publicly before.,We're excited.,We've got to get past this point.,We now want this ball of cellsnto start to gastrulate,,to turn in so that it will producenthe other tissues.,It'll go on and producena tadpole and then a frog.,Watch this space.,I think we're going to haventhis frog hopping,glad to be back in the world again. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We haven't done it yet,nbut keep the applause ready. 
 The second project I want to talknto you about is the Thylacine Project.,The thylacine looks a bit,nto most people, like a dog,,or maybe like a tiger,nbecause it has stripes.,But it's not related to any of those.nIt's a marsupial.,It raised its young in a pouch,nlike a koala or a kangaroo would do,,and it has a long history,na long, fascinating history,,that goes back 25 million years.,But it's also a tragic history. 
 The first one that we see occursnin the ancient rain forests of Australia,about 25 million years ago,,and the National Geographic Society,is helping us to explorenthese fossil deposits.,This is Riversleigh.,In those fossil rocksnare some amazing animals.,We found marsupial lions.,We found carnivorous kangaroos.,It's not what you usuallynthink about as a kangaroo,,but these are meat-eating kangaroos.,We found the biggest bird in the world,,bigger than that thingnthat was in Madagascar,,and it too was a flesh eater.,It was a giant, weird duck. 
 And crocodiles were not behavingnat that time either.,You think of crocodilesnas doing their ugly thing,,sitting in a pool of water.,These crocodilesnwere actually out on the land,and they were even climbing treesnand jumping on prey on the ground.,We had, in Australia, drop crocs.nThey really do exist. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what they were dropping onnwas not only other weird animals,but also thylacines.,There were five different kindsnof thylacines in those ancient forests,,and they ranged from great big onesnto middle-sized ones,to one that wasnabout the size of a chihuahua.,Paris Hilton would have been able,to carry one of these things aroundnin a little handbag,,until a drop croc landed on her. 
 At any rate, it was a fascinating place,,but unfortunately,nAustralia didn't stay this way.,Climate change has affected the worldnfor a long period of time,,and gradually, the forests disappeared,nthe country began to dry out,,and the number of kindsnof thylacines began to decline,,until by five million years ago,,only one left.,By 10,000 years ago,nthey had disappeared from New Guinea,,and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago,nsomebodies, we don't know who this was,,introduced dingoes --nthis is a very archaic kind of a dog --,into Australia. 
 And as you can see,,dingoes are very similarnin their body form to thylacines.,That similarity meantnthey probably competed.,They were eating the same kinds of foods.,It's even possible that aborigines werenkeeping some of these dingoes as pets,,and therefore they may have hadnan advantage in the battle for survival.,All we know is, soon afternthe dingoes were brought in,,thylacines were extinctnin the Australian mainland,,and after that they onlynsurvived in Tasmania. 
 Then, unfortunately,,the next sad part of the thylacine storynis that Europeans arrived in 1788,,and they brought with themnthe things they valued,,and that included sheep.,They took one looknat the thylacine in Tasmania,,and they thought, hang on,nthis is not going to work.,That guy is going to eat all our sheep.,That was not what happened, actually.,Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep,nbut the thylacine got a bad rap.,But immediately, the government said,nthat's it, let's get rid of them,,and they paid peoplento slaughter every one that they saw.,By the early 1930s,,3,000 to 4,000 thylacinesnhad been murdered.,It was a disaster,nand they were about to hit the wall. 
 Have a look at this bit of film footage.,It makes me very sad because,nwhile it's a fascinating animal,,and it's amazing to thinknthat we had the technology to film it,before it actually plunged offnthat cliff of extinction,,we didn't, unfortunately,nat this same time,,have a molecule of concernnabout the welfare for this species.,These are photos of the lastnsurviving thylacine, Benjamin,,who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.,To add insult to injury,,having swept this speciesnnearly off the table,,this animal, when it died of neglect --,The keepers didn't let itninto the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.,It died of exposure, and in the morning,nwhen they found the body of Benjamin,,they still cared so little for this animalnthat they threw the body in the dump. 
 Does it have to stay this way?,In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.,I was fascinated by thylacines.,I've always been obsessednwith these animals.,And I was studying skulls,,trying to figure out their relationshipsnto other sorts of animals,,and I saw this jar,,and here, in the jar,nwas a little girl thylacine pup,,perhaps six months old.,The guy who had found itnand killed the mother,had pickled the pup,nand they pickled it in alcohol.,I'm a paleontologist, but I still knewnalcohol was a DNA preservative. 
 But this was 1990,nand I asked my geneticist friends,,couldn't we thinknabout going into this pup,and extracting DNA, if it's there,,and then somewherendown the line in the future,,we'll use this DNAnto bring the thylacine back?,The geneticists laughed.nBut this was six years before Dolly.,Cloning was science fiction.,It had not happened.,But then suddenly cloning did happen.,And I thought, when I becamendirector of the Australian Museum,,I'm going to give this a go. 
 I put a team together.,We went into that pupnto see what was in it,,and we did find thylacine DNA.,It was a eureka moment.nWe were very excited.,Unfortunately, we also foundna lot of human DNA.,Every old curatornwho'd been in that museum,had seen this wonderful specimen,,put their hand in the jar,npulled it out and thought,,"Wow, look at that,"nplop, dropped it back in the jar,,contaminating this specimen.,And that was a worry.,If the goal here was to get the DNA out,and use the DNA down the tracknto try to bring a thylacine back,,what we didn't want happening,when the informationnwas shoved into the machine,and the wheel turned aroundnand the lights flashed,,was to have a wizened old horrible curatornpop out the other end of the machine.,It would've kept the curator very happy,nbut it wasn't going to keep us happy. 
 So we went back to these specimensnand we started digging around,,and particularly,nwe looked into the teeth of skulls,,hard parts where humansnhad not been able to get their fingers,,and we found much better quality DNA.,We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.,It's there. So we got it. 
 OK. What could we do with this stuff?,Well, George Church,nin his book, "Regenesis,",has mentioned many of the techniquesnthat are rapidly advancing,to work with fragmented DNA.,We would hope that we'll be ablento get that DNA back into a viable form,,and then, much like we've donenwith the Lazarus Project,,get that stuff into an eggnof a host species.,It has to be a different species.nWhat could it be?,Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?,They're related, distantly, to thylacines.,And then the Tasmanian devil is goingnto pop a thylacine out the south end. 
 Critics of this project say, hang on.,Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?nThat's going to hurt.,No, it's not. These are marsupials.,They give birth to babiesnthat are the size of a jelly bean.,That Tasmanian devil'snnot even going to know it gave birth.,It is, shortly, going to think,it's got the ugliestnTasmanian devil baby in the world,,so maybe it'll need some helpnto keep it going. 
 Andrew Pask and his colleaguesnhave demonstrated,this might not be a waste of time.,And it's sort of in the future,nwe haven't got there yet,,but it's the kind of thingnwe want to think about.,They took some of this samenpickled thylacine DNA,and they spliced it into a mouse genome,,but they put a tag on it,so that anythingnthat this thylacine DNA produced,would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.,In other words, if thylacine tissuesnwere being produced by the thylacine DNA,,it would be able to be recognized.,When the baby popped up,nit was filled with blue-green tissues.,And that tells us if we can getnthat genome back together,,get it into a live cell,,it's going to produce thylacine stuff. 
 Is this a risk?,You've taken the bits of one animal,and you've mixed them into the cellnof a different kind of an animal.,Are we going to get a Frankenstein?nSome kind of weird hybrid chimera?,And the answer is no.,If the only nuclear DNA that goesninto this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,,that's the only thing that can pop outnthe other end of the devil. 
 OK, if we can do this,ncould we put it back?,This is a key question for everybody.,Does it have to stay in a laboratory,nor could we put it back where it belongs?,Could we put it back in the thronenof the king of beasts in Tasmania,,restore that ecosystem?,Or has Tasmania changed so muchnthat that's no longer possible?,I've been to Tasmania.,I've been to many of the areasnwhere the thylacines were common.,I've even spoken to people,nlike Peter Carter here,,who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,,but in 1926, this mannand his father and his brother,caught thylacines.,They trapped them.,And when I spoke to this man,nI was looking in his eyes and thinking,,"Behind those eyes is a brain that hasnmemories of what thylacines feel like,,what they smelled like,nwhat they sounded like.",He led them around on a rope.,He has personal experiences,that I would give my left legnto have in my head.,We'd all love to haventhis sort of thing happen.,Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,,could he take us backnto where he caught those thylacines.,My interest was in whethernthe environment had changed.,He thought hard. It was nearly 80 yearsnbefore this that he'd been at this hut. 
 At any rate, he led usndown this bush track,,and there, right where he remembered,,was the hut,,and tears came into his eyes.,He looked at the hut. We went inside.,There were the wooden boardsnon the sides of the hut,where he and his fathernand his brother had slept at night.,And he told me, as it allnwas flooding back in memories.,He said, "I remembernthe thylacines going around the hut,wondering what was inside,",and he said they made soundsnlike "Yip! Yip! Yip!",All of these are parts of his lifenand what he remembers.,And the key question for menwas to ask Peter, has it changed?,And he said no.,The southern beech forestsnsurrounded his hut,just like it wasnwhen he was there in 1926.,The grasslands were sweeping away.,That's classic thylacine habitat.,And the animals in those areasnwere the same that were there,when the thylacine was around.,So could we put it back? Yes. 
 Is that all we would do?nAnd this is an interesting question.,Sometimes you mightnbe able to put it back,,but is that the safest waynto make sure it never goes extinct again?,And I don't think so.,I think gradually, as we see speciesnall around the world,,it's kind of a mantra that wildlifenis increasingly not safe in the wild.,We'd love to think it is,nbut we know it isn't.,We need other parallelnstrategies coming online.,And this one interests me.,Some of the thylacinesnthat were being turned in to zoos,,sanctuaries, even at the museums,,had collar marks on the neck.,They were being kept as pets,,and we know a lotnof bush tales and memories,of people who had them as pets,,and they say they werenwonderful, friendly.,This particular one,came in out of the forest to lick this boy,and curled up aroundnthe fireplace to go to sleep.,A wild animal. 
 And I'd like to ask the question.nWe need to think about this.,If it had not been illegalnto keep these thylacines as pets then,,would the thylacine be extinct now?,And I'm positive it wouldn't.,We need to thinknabout this in today's world.,Could it be that getting animalsnclose to us so that we value them,,maybe they won't go extinct?,And this is such a critical issue for us,because if we don't do that,,we're going to watch more of these animalsnplunge off the precipice. 
 As far as I'm concerned,,this is why we're trying to donthese kinds of de-extinction projects.,We are trying to restorenthat balance of nature,that we have upset. 
 Thank you.

 (Video) Judge: White card.nGuillaume Néry! National record! 
 Guillaume Néry: Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much,nthanks for the warm welcome.,That dive you just watched is a journey --,a journey between two breaths.,A journey that takes placenbetween two breaths --,the last one before diving into the water,,and the first one,ncoming back to the surface.,That dive is a journeynto the very limits of human possibility,,a journey into the unknown.,But it's also, and above all,nan inner journey,,where a number of things happen,,physiologically as well as mentally.,And that's why I'm here today,,to share my journey with younand to take you along with me. 
 So, we start with the last breath.,(Breathing in),(Breathing out),As you noticed, that last breathnin is slow, deep and intense.,It ends with a special techniquencalled the carp,,which allows me to store one to twonextra liters of air in my lungs,by compressing it.,When I leave the surface,nI have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.,As soon as I leave the surfacenthe first mechanism kicks in:,the diving reflex.,The first thing the diving reflex doesnis make your heart rate drop.,My heart beat will dropnfrom about 60-70 per minute,to about 30-40 beats per minute,in a matter of seconds;nalmost immediately. 
 Next, the diving reflex causesnperipheral vasoconstriction,,which means that the blood flownwill leave the body's extremities,to feed the most important organs:,the lungs, the heart and the brain.,This mechanism is innate.,I cannot control it.,If you go underwater,neven if you've never done it before,,you'll experience the exact same effects.,All human beingsnshare this characteristic.,And what's extraordinary,is that we share this instinctnwith marine mammals --,all marine mammals:ndolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.,When they dive deep into the ocean,nthese mechanisms become activated,,but to a greater extent.,And, of course, it worksnmuch better for them.,It's absolutely fascinating. 
 Right as I leave the surface,,nature gives me a pushnin the right direction,,allowing me to descend with confidence. 
 So as I dive deeper into the blue,,the pressure slowly startsnto squeeze my lungs.,And since it's the amount of airnin my lungs that makes me float,,the farther down I go,nthe more pressure there is on my lungs,,the less air they containnand the easier it is for my body to fall.,And at one point,naround 35 or 40 meters down,,I don't even need to swim.,My body is dense and heavy enoughnto fall into the depths by itself,,and I enter what's callednthe free fall phase.,The free fall phasenis the best part of the dive.,It's the reason I still dive.,Because it feels likenyou're being pulled down,and you don't need to do anything.,I can go from 35 meters to 123 metersnwithout making a single movement.,I let myself be pulled by the depths,,and it feels like I'm flying underwater.,It's truly an amazing feeling --nan extraordinary feeling of freedom. 
 And so I slowly continuensliding to the bottom.,40 meters down,,50 meters down,,and between 50 and 60 meters,na second physiological response kicks in.,My lungs reach residual volume,,below which they're not supposednto be compressed, in theory.,And this second responsenis called blood shift,,or "pulmonary erection" in French.,I prefer "blood shift." 
 (Laughter) 
 So blood shift -- how does it work?,The capillaries in the lungsnbecome engorged with blood --,which is caused by the suction --,so the lungs can harden,and protect the whole chest cavitynfrom being crushed.,It prevents the two wallsnof the lungs from collapsing,,from sticking together and caving in.,Thanks to this phenomenon,nwhich we also share with marine mammals,,I'm able to continue with my dive. 
 60, 70 meters down,nI keep falling, faster and faster,,because the pressure is crushingnmy body more and more.,Below 80 meters,,the pressure becomes a lot stronger,,and I start to feel it physically.,I really start to feel the suffocation.,You can see what it looks like --nnot pretty at all.,The diaphragm is completely collapsed,nthe rib cage is squeezed in,,and mentally, there is somethingngoing on as well. 
 You may be thinking,n"This doesn't look enjoyable.,How do you do it?",If I relied on my earthly reflexes --,what do we do above waternwhen there's a problem?,We resist, we go against it.,We fight.,Underwater, that doesn't work.,If you try that underwater,nyou might tear your lungs,,spit up blood, develop an edema,and you'll have to stop divingnfor a good amount of time.,So what you need to do, mentally,nis to tell yourself,that nature and the elementsnare stronger than you. 
 And so I let the water crush me.,I accept the pressure and go with it.,At this point, my bodynreceives this information,,and my lungs start relaxing.,I relinquish all control,nand relax completely.,The pressure starts crushing me,nand it doesn't feel bad at all.,I even feel likenI'm in a cocoon, protected. 
 And the dive continues.,80, 85 meters down,,90,,100.,100 meters -- the magic number.,In every sport, it's a magic number.,For swimmers and athletesnand also for us, free divers,,it's a number everyone dreams of.,Everyone wishes one daynto be able to get to 100 meters.,And it's a symbolic number for us,,because in the 1970s,ndoctors and physiologists did their math,,and predicted that the human bodynwould not be able to go below 100 meters.,Below that, they said,nthe human body would implode.,And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --,you all know him as the heronin "The Big Blue" --,came along and dived down to 100 meters.,He even reached 105 meters.,At that time, he was doing "no limits.",He'd use weights to descend fasternand come back up with a balloon,,just like in the movie.,Today, we go down 200 metersnin no limit free diving.,I can do 123 metersnby simply using muscle strength.,And in a way, it's all thanks to him,nbecause he challenged known facts,,and with a sweep of his hand,ngot rid of the theoretical beliefs,and all the mental limitsnthat we like to impose on ourselves.,He showed us that the human bodynhas an infinite ability to adapt. 
 So I carry on with my dive.,105, 110, 115.,The bottom is getting closer.,120,,123 meters.,I'm at the bottom. 
 And now, I'd like to ask you to join menand put yourself in my place.,Close your eyes.,Imagine you get to 123 meters.,The surface is far, far away.,You're alone.,There's hardly any light.,It's cold --,freezing cold.,The pressure is crushing you completely --,13 times stronger than on the surface.,And I know what you're thinking:,"This is horrible.,What the hell am I doing here?,He's insane.",But no.,That's not what I thinknwhen I'm down there.,When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.,I get this extraordinarynfeeling of well-being.,Maybe it's because I've completelynreleased all tensions,and let myself go.,I feel great, without the need to breathe. 
 Although, you'd agree,nI should be worried.,I feel like a tiny dot,na little drop of water,,floating in the middle of the ocean.,And each time, I picture the same image.,[The Pale Blue Dot],It's that small dotnthe arrow is pointing to.,Do you know what it is?,It's planet Earth.,Planet Earth, photographednby the Voyager probe,,from 4 billion kilometers away.,And it shows that our homenis that small dot over there,,floating in the middle of nothing. 
 That's how I feel,when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.,I feel like a small dot,,a speck of dust, stardust,,floating in the middle of the cosmos,,in the middle of nothing,nin the immensity of space.,It's a fascinating sensation,,because when I look up, down,nleft, right, in front, behind,,I see the same thing:nthe infinite deep blue.,Nowhere else on Earthnyou can experience this --,looking all around you,nand seeing the same thing.,It's extraordinary.,And at that moment,,I still get that feeling each time,nbuilding up inside of me --,the feeling of humility. 
 Looking at this picture,nI feel very humble --,just like when I'm all the wayndown at the bottom --,because I'm nothing,,I'm a little speck of nothingnessnlost in all of time and space.,And it still is absolutely fascinating.,I decide to go back to the surface,nbecause this is not where I belong.,I belong up there, on the surface. 
 So I start heading back up.,I get something of a shock,at the very moment when I decide to go up.,First, because it takes a huge effortnto tear yourself away from the bottom.,It pulled you down on the way in,,and will do the same on the way up.,You have to swim twice as hard.,Then, I'm hit with anothernphenomenon known as narcosis.,I don't know if you've heard of that.,It's called nitrogen narcosis.,It's something that happensnto scuba divers,,but it can happen to free divers.,It's caused by nitrogenndissolving in the blood,,which causes confusion,between the consciousnand unconscious mind.,A flurry of thoughts goes spinningnthrough your head.,You can't control them,nand you shouldn't try to --,you have to let it happen.,The more you try to control it,nthe harder it is to manage.,Then, a third thing happens:,the desire to breathe.,I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,,and the desire to breathenreminds me of that fact.,Around 60, 70 meters,,you start to feel the need to breathe.,And with everything else that's going on,,you can very easily lose your ground,and start to panic.,When that happens, you think,n"Where's the surface?,I want to go up. I want to breathe now.",You should not do that.,Never look up to the surface --,not with your eyes, or your mind.,You should nevernpicture yourself up there.,You have to stay in the present.,I look at the rope right in front of me,nleading me back to the surface.,And I focus on that,non the present moment.,Because if I thinknabout the surface, I panic.,And if I panic, it's over.,Time goes faster this way. 
 And at 30 meters: deliverance.,I'm not alone any more.,The safety divers,nmy guardian angels, join me.,They leave the surface,nwe meet at 30 meters,,and they escort menfor the final few meters,,where potential problems could arise.,Every time I see them, I think to myself,,"It's thanks to you.",It's thanks to them,nmy team, that I'm here.,It brings back the sense of humility.,Without my team, without allnthe people around me,,the adventure into the deepnwould be impossible.,A journey into the deepnis above all a group effort. 
 So I'm happy to finishnmy journey with them,,because I wouldn't be herenif it weren't for them.,20 meters, 10 meters,,my lungs slowly returnnto their normal volume.,Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.,Five meters below the surface,nI start to breathe out,,so that as soon as I getnto the surface all I do is breathe in.,And so I arrive at the surface.,(Breathing in),Air floods into my lungs.,It's like being born again, a relief.,It feels good.,Though the journey was extraordinary,,I do need to feel those smallnoxygen molecules fueling my body.,It's an extraordinary sensation,nbut at the same time it's traumatizing.,It's a shock to the system,nas you can you imagine.,I go from complete darknessnto the light of day,,from the near-silence of the depthsnto the commotion up top.,In terms of touch, I go from the soft,nvelvety feeling of the water,,to air rubbing across my face.,In terms of smell,,there is air rushing into my lungs. 
 And in return, my lungs open up.,They were completely squashednjust 90 seconds ago,,and now, they've opened up again.,So all of this affectsnquite a lot of things.,I need a few seconds to come back,,and to feel "all there" again.,But that needs to happen quickly,,because the judges are therento verify my performance;,I need to show themnI'm in perfect physical condition.,You saw in the video,nI was doing a so-called exit protocol.,Once at the surface, I have 15 secondsnto take off my nose clip,,give this signal and sayn(English) "I am OK.",Plus, you need to be bilingual. 
 (Laughter) 
 On top of everything --,that's not very nice.,Once the protocol is completed,nthe judges show me a white card,,and that's when the joy starts.,I can finally celebratenwhat has just happened. 
 So, the journey I've just described to you,is a more extreme version of free diving.,Luckily, it's far from just that.,For the past few years,,I've been trying to shownanother side of free diving,,because the media mainly talksnabout competitions and records.,But free diving is more than just that.,It's about being at ease in the water.,It's extremely beautiful,nvery poetic and artistic. 
 So my wife and I decided to film it,and try to show another side of it,,mostly to make people wantnto go into the water.,Let me show you some imagesnto finish my story.,It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos. 
 (Music) 
 I'd like you to know that if one daynyou try to stop breathing,,you'll realize thatnwhen you stop breathing,,you stop thinking, too.,It calms your mind. 
 Today, in the 21st century,nwe're under so much pressure.,Our minds are overworked,nwe think at a million miles an hour,,we're always stressed.,Being able to free divenlets you, just for a moment,,relax your mind.,Holding your breath underwater,means giving yourself the chancento experience weightlessness.,It means being underwater, floating,,with your body completely relaxed,nletting go of all your tensions.,This is our plight in the 21st century:,our backs hurt, our necks hurt,neverything hurts,,because we're stressednand tense all the time.,But when you're in the water,,you let yourself float,nas if you were in space.,You let yourself go completely.,It's an extraordinary feeling.,You can finally get in touchnwith your body, mind and spirit.,Everything feels better, all at once. 
 Learning how to free dive is alsonabout learning to breathe correctly.,We breathe with our first breathnat birth, up until our last one.,Breathing gives rhythm to our lives.,Learning how to breathe betternis learning how to live better.,Holding your breath in the sea,nnot necessarily at 100 meters,,but maybe at two or three,,putting on your goggles,na pair of flippers,,means you can go see another world,,another universe, completely magical.,You can see little fish, seaweed,nthe flora and fauna,,you can watch it all discreetly,,sliding underwater, looking around,nand coming back to the surface,,leaving no trace.,It's an amazing feelingnto become one with nature like that. 
 And if I may say one more thing,,holding your breath, being in the water,nfinding this underwater world --,it's all about connecting with yourself.,You heard me talk a lotnabout the body's memory,that dates back millions of years,nto our marine origins.,The day you get back into the water,,when you hold your breathnfor a few seconds,,you will reconnect with those origins.,And I guarantee,it's absolute magic.,I encourage you to try it out. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the northwest cornernof the United States,,right up near the Canadian border,,there's a little townncalled Libby, Montana,,and it's surroundednby pine trees and lakes,and just amazing wildlife,and these enormous treesnthat scream up into the sky.,And in there is a little townncalled Libby,,which I visited, which feelsnkind of lonely,,a little isolated.,And in Libby, Montana,nthere's a rather unusual woman,named Gayla Benefield.,She always felt a little bitnof an outsider,,although she's been therenalmost all her life,,a woman of Russian extraction.,She told me when she went to school,,she was the only girl who ever chose,to do mechanical drawing.,Later in life, she gotna job going house to house,reading utility meters -- gasnmeters, electricity meters.,And she was doing the worknin the middle of the day,,and one thing particularlyncaught her notice, which was,,in the middle of the daynshe met a lot of men,who were at home, middlenaged, late middle aged,,and a lot of them seemednto be on oxygen tanks.,It struck her as strange.,Then, a few years later, hernfather died at the age of 59,,five days before he was duento receive his pension.,He'd been a miner.,She thought he must just havenbeen worn out by the work.,But then a few yearsnlater, her mother died,,and that seemed stranger still,,because her mother camenfrom a long line of people,who just seemed to live forever.,In fact, Gayla's unclenis still alive to this day,,and learning how to waltz.,It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother,should die so young.,It was an anomaly, and she keptnpuzzling over anomalies.,And as she did, other ones came to mind.,She remembered, for example,,when her mother had broken a legnand went into the hospital,,and she had a lot of x-rays,,and two of them were legnx-rays, which made sense,,but six of them were chestnx-rays, which didn't.,She puzzled and puzzled over every piece,of her life and her parents' life,,trying to understand what she was seeing.,She thought about her town.,The town had a vermiculite mine in it.,Vermiculite was usednfor soil conditioners,,to make plants grow faster and better.,Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,,huge amounts of it put under the roof,to keep houses warmnduring the long Montana winters.,Vermiculite was in the playground.,It was in the football ground.,It was in the skating rink.,What she didn't learn until she startednworking this problem,is vermiculite is a veryntoxic form of asbestos.,When she figured out the puzzle,,she started telling everyone she could,what had happened, what hadnbeen done to her parents,and to the peoplenthat she saw on oxygen tanks,at home in the afternoons.,But she was really amazed.,She thought, when everybody knows,nthey'll want to do something,,but actually nobody wanted to know.,In fact, she became so annoying,as she kept insistingnon telling this story,to her neighbors, to her friends,nto other people in the community,,that eventually a bunchnof them got together,and they made a bumper sticker,,which they proudly displayednon their cars, which said,,"Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,,and no, I don't have asbestosis.",But Gayla didn't stop.nShe kept doing research.,The advent of the Internetndefinitely helped her.,She talked to anybody she could.,She argued and argued,nand finally she struck lucky,when a researcher came through town,studying the history of mines in the area,,and she told him her story,nand at first, of course,,like everyone, he didn't believe her,,but he went back to Seattlenand he did his own research,and he realized that she was right.,So now she had an ally.,Nevertheless, people stillndidn't want to know.,They said things like, "Well,nif it were really dangerous,,someone would have told us.","If that's really why everyone was dying,,the doctors would have told us.",Some of the guys usednto very heavy jobs said,,"I don't want to be a victim.,I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,,every industry has its accidents.",But still Gayla went on,nand finally she succeeded,in getting a federalnagency to come to town,and to screen the inhabitantsnof the town --,15,000 people -- and what they discovered,was that the town had a mortality rate,80 times higher than anywherenin the United States.,That was in 2002, and even at that moment,,no one raised their hand to say, "Gayla,,look in the playground wherenyour grandchildren are playing.,It's lined with vermiculite.",This wasn't ignorance.,It was willful blindness.,Willful blindness is a legalnconcept which means,,if there's information that youncould know and you should know,but you somehow manage not to know,,the law deems that you're willfully blind.,You have chosen not to know.,There's a lot of willfulnblindness around these days.,You can see willful blindness in banks,,when thousands of peoplensold mortgages to people,who couldn't afford them.,You could see them in banks,when interest rates were manipulated,and everyone around knewnwhat was going on,,but everyone studiously ignored it.,You can see willful blindnessnin the Catholic Church,,where decades of child abuse went ignored.,You could see willful blindness,in the run-up to the Iraq War.,Willful blindness existsnon epic scales like those,,and it also exists on very small scales,,in people's families,nin people's homes and communities,,and particularly in organizationsnand institutions.,Companies that have been studiednfor willful blindness,can be asked questions like,,"Are there issues at work,that people are afraid to raise?",And when academics havendone studies like this,of corporations in the United States,,what they find is 85npercent of people say yes.,Eighty-five percent of peoplenknow there's a problem,,but they won't say anything.,And when I duplicatednthe research in Europe,,asking all the same questions,,I found exactly the same number.,Eighty-five percent.nThat's a lot of silence.,It's a lot of blindness.,And what's really interesting is that whennI go to companies in Switzerland,,they tell me, "Thisnis a uniquely Swiss problem.",And when I go to Germany, they say,n"Oh yes, this is the German disease.",And when I go to companiesnin England, they say,,"Oh, yeah, the Britishnare really bad at this.",And the truth is, this is a human problem.,We're all, under certainncircumstances, willfully blind.,What the research showsnis that some people are blind,out of fear. They'renafraid of retaliation.,And some people are blindnbecause they think, well,,seeing anything is just futile.,Nothing's ever going to change.,If we make a protest, if we protestnagainst the Iraq War,,nothing changes, so why bother?,Better not to see this stuff at all.,And the recurrent thementhat I encounter all the time,is people say, "Well, you know,,the people who do see,nthey're whistleblowers,,and we all know what happens to them.",So there's this profoundnmythology around whistleblowers,which says, first of all,nthey're all crazy.,But what I've found going around the world,and talking to whistleblowersnis, actually,,they're very loyal and quitenoften very conservative people.,They're hugely dedicatednto the institutions that they work for,,and the reason that they speak up,,the reason they insist on seeing,,is because they care sonmuch about the institution,and want to keep it healthy.,And the other thing that people often say,about whistleblowers is,n"Well, there's no point,,because you see what happens to them.,They are crushed.,Nobody would want to gonthrough something like that.",And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,,the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.,I think of Joe Darby.,We all remember the photographsnof Abu Ghraib,,which so shocked the worldnand showed the kind of war,that was being fought in Iraq.,But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,,the very obedient, good soldier,who found those photographsnand handed them in.,And he said, "You know,nI'm not the kind of guy,to rat people out, but some thingsnjust cross the line.,Ignorance is bliss, they say,,but you can't putnup with things like this.",I talked to Steve Bolsin,na British doctor,,who fought for five yearsnto draw attention,to a dangerous surgeonnwho was killing babies.,And I asked him whynhe did it, and he said,,"Well, it was really my daughternwho prompted me to do it.,She came up to me one night,nand she just said,,'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'",Or I think of Cynthia Thomas,,a really loyal armyndaughter and army wife,,who, as she saw her friends and relations,coming back from the IraqnWar, was so shocked,by their mental condition,and the refusal of the militarynto recognize and acknowledge,post-traumatic stress syndrome,that she set up a cafenin the middle of a military town,to give them legal, psychologicalnand medical assistance.,And she said to me, she said,n"You know, Margaret,,I always used to say I didn'tnknow what I wanted to be,when I grow up.,But I've found myself in this cause,,and I'll never be the same.",We all enjoy so many freedoms today,,hard-won freedoms:,the freedom to write and publishnwithout fear of censorship,,a freedom that wasn't herenthe last time I came to Hungary;,a freedom to vote,nwhich women in particular,had to fight so hard for;,the freedom for people of differentnethnicities and cultures,and sexual orientation to liventhe way that they want.,But freedom doesn't existnif you don't use it,,and what whistleblowers do,,and what people like Gayla Benefield do,is they use the freedom that they have.,And what they're verynprepared to do is recognize,that yes, this is going to be an argument,,and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows,with my neighborsnand my colleagues and my friends,,but I'm going to becomenvery good at this conflict.,I'm going to take on the naysayers,,because they'll make my argumentnbetter and stronger.,I can collaborate with my opponents,to become better at what I do.,These are people of immense persistence,,incredible patience,nand an absolute determination,not to be blind and not to be silent.,When I went to Libby, Montana,,I visited the asbestosis clinic,that Gayla Benefield brought into being,,a place where at first some of the people,who wanted help and needednmedical attention,went in the back door,because they didn't want to acknowledge,that she'd been right.,I sat in a diner, and I watched,as trucks drove up and down the highway,,carting away the earth out of gardens,and replacing it with fresh,nuncontaminated soil.,I took my 12-year-old daughter with me,,because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.,And she said, "Why? What's the big deal?",I said, "She's not a movie star,,and she's not a celebrity,nand she's not an expert,,and Gayla's the first person who'd say,she's not a saint.,The really important thing about Gayla,is she is ordinary.,She's like you, and she's like me.,She had freedom,nand she was ready to use it.",Thank you very much.,(Applause)I want to share some personal friends and stories with you,that I've actually never talked about in public before,to help illustrate the idea,and the need and the hope,for us to reinvent our health care system around the world.,Twenty-four years ago, I had -- a sophomore in college,,I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.,And I ended up in student health,,and they ran some labwork and came back right away,,and said, "Kidney problems.",And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into,this six months of tests and trials and tribulations,with six doctors across two hospitals,in this clash of medical titans,to figure out which one of them was right,about what was wrong with me.,And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,,and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,,and I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news.",And their diagnosis was this:,They said, "You have two rare kidney diseases,that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,,you have cancer-like cells in your immune system,that we need to start treatment right away,,and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,,and you're not likely to live more than two or three years." 
 Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,,it just sucked me in immediately,,as if I began preparing myself as a patient,to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,,until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,,who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day,and took me off to the medical library,and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,,and said, "Eric, these people who get this,are normally in their '70s and '80s.,They don't know anything about you. Wake up.,Take control of your health and get on with your life.",And I did. 
 Now, these people making these proclamations to me,were not bad people.,In fact, these professionals were miracle workers,,but they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.,It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.,It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.,It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,,and so something either works or you die.,And it's dependent on passive patients,who just take it and don't ask any questions. 
 Now the problem with this model,is that it's unsustainable globally.,It's unaffordable globally.,We need to invent what I call a personal health system.,So what does this personal health system look like,,and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail? 
 Now, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you,a new friend of mine, Libby,,somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.,This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.,This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.,Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,,and you'll notice, on the edge of this image,,there's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.,So we're going to actually do a live exam,to sort of see how Libby's doing.,This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.,Don't you in the front row worry or anything.,(Laughter),I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.,This is a portable ultrasound.,It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.,Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,,and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.,They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.,This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.,All right, I gotta gel up.,Now the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter) 
 And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,,who's another friend of mine.,He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.,So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?,And actually, can you see Libby? 
 Thomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.,You look busy. How are you? 
 Eric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off,in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.,So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?,And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there. 
 TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,,give me a lay of the land. 
 ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,,a little bit toward the middle for me.,Okay, that's good. How about up a little bit?,Okay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me. 
 ED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,,you had me measure that spot to the right.,Should I do that again? 
 TB: Yeah, let's do that. 
 ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do,with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,,but I've got it, I think,,and I'll save that image and send it to you.,So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.,It's not something I was very happy about. 
 TB: Many people after a kidney transplant,will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.,Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,,but it does warrant looking at,,so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,,make sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.,Based on the other images we have,,I'm really happy how it looks today. 
 ED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.,I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,,and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,,because I don't think I can do that one on myself. 
 TB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.,All right. So what you're sort of seeing here,is an example of disruptive technologies,,of mobile, social and analytic technologies.,These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible. 
 Now there's really three pillars,of this personal health I want to talk to you about now,,and it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.,And you just saw a little bit of the first two,with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk. 
 So let's start with care anywhere.,Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics,in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.,We have got to untether clinicians and patients,from the notion of traveling to a special,bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,,because these places are often the wrong tool,,and the most expensive tool, for the job.,And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,,especially in an era of superbugs,and hospital-acquired infections.,And many countries are going to go brickless from the start,because they're never going to be able to afford,the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.,Now I personally learned that hospitals,can be a very dangerous place at a young age.,This was me in third grade.,I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,,worried that they were going to actually lose the arm.,Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.,Those bedsores become infected,,and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,,and now my whole body breaks out,,and now all of those become infected.,The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,,and the more expensive it became,,and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.,The future of personal health that I'm talking about,says care must occur at home as the default model,,not in a hospital or clinic.,You have to earn your way into those places,by being sick enough to use that tool for the job.,Now the smartphones that we're already carrying,can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,,and a whole array of others, today,,and as sensing is built into these,,we'll be able to do vital signs monitor,and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.,Many of us will have implantables that will actually look,real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry,and in our proteins right now.,Now the software is also getting smarter, right?,Think about a coach, an agent online,,that's going to help me do safe self-care.,That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound,will likely have real-time image processing,,and the device will say, "Up, down, left, right,,ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image,off to your doctor." 
 Now, if we've got all these networked devices,that are helping us to do care anywhere,,it stands to reason that we also need a team,to be able to interact with all of that stuff,,and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,,care networking.,We have got to go beyond this paradigm,of isolated specialists doing parts care,to multidisciplinary teams doing person care.,Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best,,and it is deadly at worst.,Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused,by communication and coordination problems,amongst medical team members.,I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,,when we're under treatment for the kidney,,and suddenly, they're like, "Oh, we think you have a heart problem.",And I have these palpitations that are showing up.,They put me through five weeks of tests --,very expensive, very scary -- before the nurse finally notices,the piece of the paper, my meds list,that I've been carrying to every single appointment,,and says, "Oh my gosh.",Three different specialists had prescribed,three different versions of the same drug to me.,I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.,I had a care coordination problem.,And this happens to millions of people every year.,I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen,to make health care a coordinated team sport.,Now this is the most frightening thing to me.,Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,,the first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience,was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months,for me to go get this.,And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.,There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.,We just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,,Allison, who helped manage the transplant list,,and a dozen other people who aren't pictured,,a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,,even a financial counselor, Lisa,,who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.,I wept the day I graduated.,I should have been happy, because I was so well,that I could go back to my normal doctors,,but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team. 
 And here's the most important part.,The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.,Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home,so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.,That's the only way that the model works.,My team is actually working in China,on one of these self-care models,for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.,We're trying to help build a social network,that can help track and train the care of seniors,caring for themselves,as well as the care provided by their family members,or volunteer community health workers,,as well as have an exchange network online,,where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,,if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,,and we exchange all of that online.,The most important point I want to make to you about this,is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized,doctor-patient one-on-one,is a relic of the past.,The future of health care is smart teams,,and you'd better be on that team for yourself. 
 Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about,is care customization,,because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,,those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,,but there's still too much guesswork.,Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948,to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,,and those are important things, don't get me wrong.,These population studies that we've done have created,tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,,but the problem is that health care,is treating us as averages, not unique individuals,,because at the end of the day,,the patient is not the same thing as the population,who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.,The technologies that are coming,,high-performance computing, analytics,,big data that everyone's talking about,,will allow us to build predictive models for each of us,as individual patients.,And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar,in software, not my body in suffering. 
 Now, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you,of this kind of care customization on my own journey.,The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago,that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.,It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.,I was optimizing my life for quality of life,,and quality of life for me means time in snow.,So on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal:,low doses of drugs over longer periods of time,,side effects friendly to skiing.",And I think that's why I achieved longevity.,I think that time-in-snow therapy was as important,as the pharmaceuticals that I had.,Now the second example of customization -- and by the way,,you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,,so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.,But the second example I want to give you is,,I happened to be an early guinea pig,,and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.,Now it took about two weeks of processing,on Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,,and another six months of human and computing labor,to make sense of all of that data.,And at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes,,those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans,all of those years ago were wrong,,and we have a better path forward.",The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out,how to make that computing for personalized medicine,go from months and weeks to even hours,,and make this kind of tool available,,not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,,but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic,with access to whole genome sequencing.,And I tell you, this kind of care customization,for everything from your goals to your genetics,will be the most game-changing transformation,that we witness in health care during our lifetime. 
 So these three pillars of personal health,,care anywhere, care networking, care customization,,are happening in pieces now,,but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up,as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.,It's what my friend Verna said:,Wake up and take control of your health.,Because at the end of the day these technologies,are simply about people caring for other people,and ourselves in some powerful new ways. 
 And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you,to one last friend, very quickly.,Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney,that I was never supposed to have. 
 (Applause) 
 So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you. 
 Tracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.,I only had one night in the hospital.,The surgery was done laparoscopically,,so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,,and I had four weeks away from work,and went back to doing everything I'd done before,without any changes. 
 ED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you,in such a large audience ever again.,So "thank you" feel likes a really trite word,,but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. 
 (Applause) 
 This TED stage and all of the TED stages,are often about celebrating innovation,and celebrating new technologies,,and I've done that here today,,and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,,I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.,But until such time that these amazing technologies,are available to all of us, and even when they are,,it's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.,I hope you will go out and make personal health happen,for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much. 
 (Applause)When I was 27 years old,,I left a very demanding jobnin management consulting,for a job that was even morendemanding: teaching.,I went to teach seventh graders math,in the New York City public schools.,And like any teacher,nI made quizzes and tests.,I gave out homework assignments.,When the work came back,nI calculated grades. 
 What struck me was that IQnwas not the only difference,between my best and my worst students.,Some of my strongest performersndid not have stratospheric IQ scores.,Some of my smartest kidsnweren't doing so well.,And that got me thinking.,The kinds of things you neednto learn in seventh grade math,,sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,nthe area of a parallelogram.,But these concepts are not impossible,,and I was firmly convincednthat every one of my students,could learn the material,if they worked hard and long enough. 
 After several more years of teaching,,I came to the conclusionnthat what we need in education,is a much better understandingnof students and learning,from a motivational perspective,,from a psychological perspective.,In education, the one thingnwe know how to measure best is IQ.,But what if doingnwell in school and in life,depends on much more,than your ability to learnnquickly and easily? 
 So I left the classroom,,and I went to graduate schoolnto become a psychologist.,I started studying kids and adults,in all kinds of supernchallenging settings,,and in every study my question was,,who is successful here and why?,My research team and I wentnto West Point Military Academy.,We tried to predict which cadets,would stay in military trainingnand which would drop out.,We went to the National Spelling Bee,and tried to predict which childrennwould advance farthest in competition.,We studied rookie teachersnworking in really tough neighborhoods,,asking which teachers are stillngoing to be here in teaching,by the end of the school year,,and of those, who will benthe most effective,at improving learningnoutcomes for their students?,We partnered with privatencompanies, asking,,which of these salespeoplenis going to keep their jobs?,And who's going to earn the most money?,In all those very different contexts,,one characteristic emergednas a significant predictor of success.,And it wasn't social intelligence.,It wasn't good looks, physical health,,and it wasn't IQ.,It was grit. 
 Grit is passion and perseverancenfor very long-term goals.,Grit is having stamina.,Grit is sticking with your future,nday in, day out,,not just for the week,nnot just for the month,,but for years,,and working really hardnto make that future a reality.,Grit is living lifenlike it's a marathon, not a sprint. 
 A few years ago,,I started studying gritnin the Chicago public schools.,I asked thousands of high school juniors,to take grit questionnaires,,and then waited around more than a year,to see who would graduate.,Turns out that grittier kids,were significantly morenlikely to graduate,,even when I matched themnon every characteristic I could measure,,things like family income,,standardized achievement test scores,,even how safe kids feltnwhen they were at school.,So it's not just at West Pointnor the National Spelling Bee,that grit matters.,It's also in school,,especially for kidsnat risk for dropping out. 
 To me, the most shocking thing about grit,is how little we know,,how little science knows,nabout building it.,Every day, parents and teachers ask me,,"How do I build grit in kids?,What do I do to teach kidsna solid work ethic?,How do I keep them motivatednfor the long run?",The honest answer is,,I don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 What I do know is that talentndoesn't make you gritty.,Our data show very clearly,that there are many talented individuals,who simply do not follow throughnon their commitments.,In fact, in our data,ngrit is usually unrelated,or even inversely relatednto measures of talent. 
 So far, the best idea I've heardnabout building grit in kids,is something called "growth mindset.",This is an idea developednat Stanford University by Carol Dweck,,and it is the belief that the abilitynto learn is not fixed,,that it can change with your effort.,Dr. Dweck has shown,that when kids readnand learn about the brain,and how it changes and growsnin response to challenge,,they're much more likelynto persevere when they fail,,because they don't believe that failurenis a permanent condition. 
 So growth mindsetnis a great idea for building grit.,But we need more.,And that's where I'm goingnto end my remarks,,because that's where we are.,That's the work that stands before us.,We need to take our best ideas,nour strongest intuitions,,and we need to test them.,We need to measurenwhether we've been successful,,and we have to be willingnto fail, to be wrong,,to start over again with lessons learned. 
 In other words, we need to be gritty,about getting our kids grittier. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'll never forget that day,back in the spring of 2006.,I was a surgical resident,at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,,taking emergency call.,I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning,to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer,on her foot.,I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh,as I pulled the curtain back to see her.,And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick,and she needed to be in the hospital.,That wasn't being asked.,The question that was being asked of me was a different one,,which was, did she also need an amputation? 
 Now, looking back on that night,,I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman,on that night with the same empathy and compassion,I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed,who came to the E.R. three nights earlier,with lower back pain,that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.,In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do,that was actually going to save her life.,The cancer was too advanced.,But I was committed to making sure that,I could do anything possible to make her stay,more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket,and a cup of a coffee.,I brought some for her parents.,But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,,because obviously she had done nothing,to bring this on herself.,So why was it that, just a few nights later,,as I stood in that same E.R. and determined,that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,,why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? 
 You see, unlike the woman the night before,,this woman had type 2 diabetes.,She was fat.,And we all know that's from eating too much,and not exercising enough, right?,I mean, how hard can it be?,As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,,if you just tried caring even a little bit,,you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment,with some doctor you've never met,about to amputate your foot. 
 Why did I feel justified in judging her?,I'd like to say I don't know.,But I actually do.,You see, in the hubris of my youth,,I thought I had her all figured out.,She ate too much. She got unlucky.,She got diabetes. Case closed. 
 Ironically, at that time in my life,,I was also doing cancer research,,immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,,and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,,to challenge all assumptions,and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.,Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes,that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,,I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.,I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events,was settled science. 
 Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.,But this time, I was the patient.,Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,,and following the food pyramid to the letter,,I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something,called metabolic syndrome.,Some of you may have heard of this.,I had become insulin-resistant. 
 You can think of insulin as this master hormone,that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,,whether we burn it or store it.,This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.,Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.,And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,,is when your cells get increasingly resistant,to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.,Once you're insulin-resistant,,you're on your way to getting diabetes,,which is what happens when your pancreas,can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.,Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,,and an entire cascade of pathologic events,sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,,cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,,and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. 
 With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,,adding and subtracting things most of you would find,almost assuredly shocking.,I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.,I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.,More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. 
 But most important, I was left,with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:,How did this happen to me if I was supposedly,doing everything right?,If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,,was it possible it was failing someone else?,And underlying these questions,,I became almost maniacally obsessed,in trying to understand the real relationship,between obesity and insulin resistance. 
 Now, most researchers believe obesity,is the cause of insulin resistance.,Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,,you get people to lose weight, right?,You treat the obesity.,But what if we have it backwards?,What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?,In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,,the tip of a proverbial iceberg?,I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst,of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.,What if obesity is a coping mechanism,for a far more sinister problem going on,underneath the cell?,I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,,but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser,of two metabolic evils. 
 You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity,of our cells to partition fuel,,as I alluded to a moment ago,,taking those calories that we take in,and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.,When we become insulin-resistant,,the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.,So now, when insulin says to a cell,,I want you to burn more energy,than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,,"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy.",And because fat cells are actually missing most of,the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,,it's probably the safest place to store it.,So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,,the appropriate response to insulin resistance,may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,,getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. 
 This is a really subtle distinction,,but the implication could be profound.,Consider the following analogy:,Think of the bruise you get on your shin,when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.,Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly,don't like the discolored look, but we all know,the bruise per Se is not the problem.,In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,,all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury,to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread,of infection to elsewhere in the body.,Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,,and we evolved a giant medical establishment,and a culture around treating bruises:,masking creams, painkillers, you name it,,all the while ignoring the fact that people,are still banging their shins into coffee tables.,How much better would we be if we treated the cause --,telling people to pay attention,when they walk through the living room --,rather than the effect?,Getting the cause and the effect right,makes all the difference in the world.,Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry,can still do very well for its shareholders,but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.,Cause and effect. 
 So what I'm suggesting is,maybe we have the cause and effect wrong,on obesity and insulin resistance.,Maybe we should be asking ourselves,,is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain,and the diseases associated with obesity,,at least in most people?,What if being obese is just a metabolic response,to something much more threatening,,an underlying epidemic,,the one we ought to be worried about? 
 Let's look at some suggestive facts.,We know that 30 million obese Americans,in the United States don't have insulin resistance.,And by the way, they don't appear to be at any,greater risk of disease than lean people.,Conversely, we know that six million lean people,in the United States are insulin-resistant,,and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk,for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago,than their obese counterparts.,Now I don't know why, but it might be because,,in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out,the right thing to do with that excess energy.,So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,,and you can be lean and have it,,this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy,for what's going on. 
 So what if we're fighting the wrong war,,fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?,Even worse, what if blaming the obese,means we're blaming the victims?,What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity,are just wrong? 
 Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,,let alone the luxury of certainty.,I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,,but I'm wide open to others.,Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,,is this.,If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from,when it becomes insulin resistant,,the answer probably isn't too much food.,It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.,Now, we know that refined grains and starches,elevate your blood sugar in the short run,,and there's even reason to believe that sugar,may lead to insulin resistance directly.,So if you put these physiological processes to work,,I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake,of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving,this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,,but through insulin resistance,,you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. 
 When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,,I did it simply by restricting those things,,which admittedly suggests I have a bias,based on my personal experience.,But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,,and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.,But step one is accepting the possibility,that our current beliefs about obesity,,diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong,and therefore must be tested.,I'm betting my career on this.,Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,,and I'll go wherever the science takes me.,I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore,is pretend I have the answers when I don't.,I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. 
 For the past year, I've been fortunate enough,to work on this problem with the most amazing team,of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,,and the best part is,,just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,,we've done the same thing.,We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,,the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses,for what's at the heart of this epidemic.,Some think it's too many calories consumed.,Others think it's too much dietary fat.,Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.,But this team of multi-disciplinary,,highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers,do agree on two things.,First, this problem is just simply too important,to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.,And two, if we're willing to be wrong,,if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom,with the best experiments science can offer,,we can solve this problem. 
 I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,,some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --,eat this, not that —,but if we want to get it right,,we're going to have to do much more rigorous science,before we can write that prescription. 
 Briefly, to address this, our research program,is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.,First, how do the various foods we consume,impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,,and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?,Second, based on these insights,,can people make the necessary changes in their diets,in a way that's safe and practical to implement?,And finally, once we identify what safe,and practical changes people can make to their diet,,how can we move their behavior in that direction,so that it becomes more the default,rather than the exception?,Just because you know what to do doesn't mean,you're always going to do it.,Sometimes we have to put cues around people,to make it easier, and believe it or not,,that can be studied scientifically. 
 I don't know how this journey is going to end,,but this much seems clear to me, at least:,We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients,like I did.,Most of them actually want to do the right thing,,but they have to know what that is,,and it's got to work.,I dream of a day when our patients can,shed their excess pounds,and cure themselves of insulin resistance,,because as medical professionals,,we've shed our excess mental baggage,and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently,to go back to our original ideals:,open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas,when they don't appear to be working,,and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,,but constantly evolving.,Staying true to that path will be better for our patients,and better for science.,If obesity is nothing more than a proxy,for metabolic illness,,what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy? 
 Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.,seven years ago.,I wish I could speak with that woman again.,I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.,I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered,the best clinical care I could,,but as a human being,,I let you down.,You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.,You needed my empathy and compassion,,and above all else, you needed a doctor,who was willing to consider,maybe you didn't let the system down.,Maybe the system, of which I was a part,,was letting you down.,If you're watching this now,,I hope you can forgive me. 
 (Applause)"Don't talk to strangers." 
 You have heard that phrase uttered,by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.,It's a norm. It's a social norm.,But it's a special kind of social norm,,because it's a social norm that wants to tell us,who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.,"Don't talk to strangers" says,,"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.,Stick with the people you know.,Stick with people like you." 
 How appealing is that?,It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?,When we're at our best, we reach out to people,who are not like us,,because when we do that, we learn from people,who are not like us. 
 My phrase for this value of being with "not like us",is "strangeness,",and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,,strangers are quite frankly not the point.,The point that we should be worried about is,,how much strangeness are we getting? 
 Why strangeness? Because our social relations,are increasingly mediated by data,,and data turns our social relations into digital relations,,and that means that our digital relations,now depend extraordinarily on technology,to bring to them a sense of robustness,,a sense of discovery,,a sense of surprise and unpredictability.,Why not strangers?,Because strangers are part of a world,of really rigid boundaries.,They belong to a world of people I know,versus people I don't know,,and in the context of my digital relations,,I'm already doing things with people I don't know.,The question isn't whether or not I know you.,The question is, what can I do with you?,What can I learn with you?,What can we do together that benefits us both? 
 I spend a lot of time thinking about,how the social landscape is changing,,how new technologies create new constraints,and new opportunities for people.,The most important changes facing us today,have to do with data and what data is doing,to shape the kinds of digital relations,that will be possible for us in the future.,The economies of the future depend on that.,Our social lives in the future depend on that.,The threat to worry about isn't strangers.,The threat to worry about is whether or not,we're getting our fair share of strangeness. 
 Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists,were thinking about strangers,,but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,,and they were thinking about strangers,in the context of influencing practices.,Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,,the creator of the small-world experiments,,which became later popularized as six degrees of separation,,made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people,were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.,His point was that strangers are out there.,We can reach them. There are paths,that enable us to reach them.,Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973,in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,",made the point that these weak ties,that are a part of our networks, these strangers,,are actually more effective at diffusing information to us,than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.,He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties,when he says that these people who are so close to us,,these strong ties in our lives,,actually have a homogenizing effect on us.,They produce sameness. 
 My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years,looking at the ways in which digital platforms,are reshaping our everyday lives,,what kinds of new routines are possible.,We've been looking specifically at the kinds,of digital platforms that have enabled us,to take our possessions, those things that used to be,very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,,and to make them available to people we don't know.,Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,,whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,,we are able to take our possessions now,and make them available to people we've never met.,And we concluded a very important insight,,which was that as people's relationships,to the things in their lives change,,so do their relations with other people.,And yet recommendation system,after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.,It continues to try to predict what I need,based on some past characterization of who I am,,of what I've already done.,Security technology after security technology,continues to design data protection,in terms of threats and attacks,,keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations. 
 Categories like "friends" and "family",and "contacts" and "colleagues",don't tell me anything about my actual relations.,A more effective way to think about my relations,might be in terms of closeness and distance,,where at any given point in time, with any single person,,I am both close and distant from that individual,,all as a function of what I need to do right now.,People aren't close or distant.,People are always a combination of the two,,and that combination is constantly changing. 
 What if technologies could intervene,to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?,What if technologies could intervene,to help me find the person that I need right now?,Strangeness is that calibration,of closeness and distance,that enables me to find the people that I need right now,,that enables me to find the sources of intimacy,,of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.,Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.,It simply makes the point that we need,to disrupt our zones of familiarity.,So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,,and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,,but also by organizations,,organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.,Whether you're a political party,insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion,of who belongs and who does not,,whether you're the government,protecting social institutions like marriage,and restricting access of those institutions to the few,,whether you're a teenager in her bedroom,who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,,strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way,to new kinds of relations.,We have to change the norms.,We have to change the norms in order to enable,new kinds of technologies,as a basis for new kinds of businesses. 
 What interesting questions lie ahead for us,in this world of no strangers?,How might we think differently about our relations with people?,How might we think differently about our relations,with distributed groups of people?,How might we think differently about our relations with technologies,,things that effectively become social participants,in their own right?,The range of digital relations is extraordinary.,In the context of this broad range of digital relations,,safely seeking strangeness might very well be,a new basis for that innovation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let's face it:,Driving is dangerous.,It's one of the things that we don't like to think about,,but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms,show up on dashboards around the world,betrays the fact that we know this to be true.,Car accidents are the leading cause of death,in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States --,leading cause of death --,and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do,with drugs or alcohol. 
 So what happens?,No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.,I was a young driver out on the highway,,and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.,I'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,,I'll slow down too.",I step on the brake.,But no, this guy isn't slowing down.,This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.,It was just going 65 -- to zero?,I slammed on the brakes.,I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,,and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,,and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,,and fortunately, no one was hurt.,But I had no idea that car was stopping,,and I think we can do a lot better than that.,I think we can transform the driving experience,by letting our cars talk to each other. 
 I just want you to think a little bit,about what the experience of driving is like now.,Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.,You can't really directly sense the world around you.,You're in this extended body.,You're tasked with navigating it down,partially-seen roadways,,in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.,Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.,Okay, so that's all you have,,eyes that weren't really designed for this task,,but then people ask you to do things like,,you want to make a lane change,,what's the first thing they ask you do?,Take your eyes off the road. That's right.,Stop looking where you're going, turn,,check your blind spot,,and drive down the road without looking where you're going.,You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.,Why do we do this? Because we have to,,we have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?,What's more important?,And usually we do a fantastic job,picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.,But occasionally we miss something.,Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.,In countless accidents, the driver says,,"I didn't see it coming.",And I believe that. I believe that.,We can only watch so much. 
 But the technology exists now that can help us improve that.,In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,,we will be able to see not just three cars ahead,and three cars behind, to the right and left,,all at the same time, bird's eye view,,we will actually be able to see into those cars.,We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,,to see how fast that guy's going or stopping.,If that guy's going down to zero, I'll know. 
 And with computation and algorithms and predictive models,,we will be able to see the future.,You may think that's impossible.,How can you predict the future? That's really hard.,Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.,Cars are three-dimensional objects,that have a fixed position and velocity.,They travel down roads.,Often they travel on pre-published routes.,It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions,about where a car's going to be in the near future.,Even if, when you're in your car,and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! --,85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting --,I know you've had this experience --,that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere.",That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.,(Laughter),Right? I mean, somebody's seen him.,Ten, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,,and as soon as one car sees that guy,and puts him on the map, he's on the map --,position, velocity,,good estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.,You'll know, because your car will know, because,that other car will have whispered something in his ear,,like, "By the way, five minutes,,motorcyclist, watch out.",You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.,I mean, they're Newtonian objects.,That's very nice about them. 
 So how do we get there?,We can start with something as simple,as sharing our position data between cars,,just sharing GPS.,If I have a GPS and a camera in my car,,I have a pretty precise idea of where I am,and how fast I'm going.,With computer vision, I can estimate where,the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.,And same with the other cars.,They can have a precise idea of where they are,,and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.,What happens if two cars share that data,,if they talk to each other?,I can tell you exactly what happens.,Both models improve.,Everybody wins.,Professor Bob Wang and his team,have done computer simulations of what happens,when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,,when cars just share GPS data,,and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation,and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors,that are in cars now on these robots:,stereo cameras, GPS,,and the two-dimensional laser range finders,that are common in backup systems.,We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,,and the robots talk to each other.,When these robots come at each other,,they track each other's position precisely,,and they can avoid each other. 
 We're now adding more and more robots into the mix,,and we encountered some problems.,One of the problems, when you get too much chatter,,it's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,,and that's where the predictive model helps you.,If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,,you don't pay as much attention to those packets.,You prioritize the one guy,who seems to be going a little off course.,That guy could be a problem.,And you can predict the new trajectory.,So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.,And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way. 
 And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone?,How can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?",Well, it depends on two things:,one, the ability of the car,,and second the ability of the driver.,If one guy has a really great car,,but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,,they're not probably in the best position,to react in an emergency.,So we started a separate line of research,doing driver state modeling.,And now, using a series of three cameras,,we can detect if a driver is looking forward,,looking away, looking down, on the phone,,or having a cup of coffee.,We can predict the accident,and we can predict who, which cars,,are in the best position to move out of the way,to calculate the safest route for everyone.,Fundamentally, these technologies exist today. 
 I think the biggest problem that we face,is our own willingness to share our data.,I think it's a very disconcerting notion,,this idea that our cars will be watching us,,talking about us to other cars,,that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.,But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,,just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,,I don't really know about you.,If I look at your license plate number,,I don't really know who you are.,I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think it's going to be a great thing.,I want you to consider for a moment,if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you,to know that you're braking,,that you're coming to a dead stop.,By sharing our data willingly,,we can do what's best for everyone. 
 So let your car gossip about you.,It's going to make the roads a lot safer. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many of you have been to Oklahoma City? 
 Raise your hand. Yeah? 
 How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City,and have no idea who I am? (Laughter) 
 Most of you. Let me give youna little bit of background. 
 Oklahoma City started in the most,unique way imaginable.,Back on a spring day in 1889,,the federal government held what they called,a land run.,They literally lined up the settlers,along an imaginary line,,and they fired off a gun,,and the settlers roared across the countryside,and put down a stake,,and wherever they put down that stake,,that was their new home.,And at the end of the very first day,,the population of Oklahoma City,had gone from zero to 10,000,,and our planning department,is still paying for that.,The citizens got together on that first day,and elected a mayor.,And then they shot him.,(Laughter),That's not really all that funny,-- (Laughter) --,but it allows me to see what type of audience,I'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback. 
 The 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.,Our economy was based on commodities,,so the price of cotton or the price of wheat,,and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.,And along the way, we became a city,of innovation.,The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.,(Applause),The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.,You're welcome. 
 Having an economy, though,,that relates to commoditiesncan give you some ups and some downs,,and that was certainly the casenin Oklahoma City's history.,In the 1970s, when it appeared,that the price of energy would never retreat,,our economy was soaring,,and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.,The price of energy dropped.,Our banks began to fail.,Before the end of the decade,,100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.,There was no bailout on the horizon.,Our banking industry, our oil and gas industry,,our commercial real estate industry,,were all at the bottom of the economic scale.,Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves,for Washington and Dallas and Houstonnand New York and Tokyo,,anywhere where they could nfind a job that measured up,to their educational attainment,,because in Oklahoma City,nthe good jobs just weren't there. 
 But along at the end of the '80s,came an enterprising businessman,who became mayor named Ron Norick.,Ron Norick eventually figured out,that the secret to economic development,wasn't incentivizing companies up front,,it was about creating a placenwhere businesses wanted to locate,,and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS,that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax,to build a bunch of stuff.,It built a new sports arena,,a new canal downtown,,it fixed up our performing arts center,,a new baseball stadium downtown,,a lot of things to improve the quality of life.,And the economy indeed seemed to start,showing some signs of life. 
 The next mayor came along.,He started MAPS for Kids,,rebuilt the entire inner city school system,,all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished. 
 And then, in 2004,,in this rare collective lack of judgment,bordering on civil disobedience,,the citizens elected me mayor. 
 Now the city I inherited,was just on the verge,of coming out of its slumbering economy,,and for the very first time,,we started showing up on the lists.,Now you know the lists I'm talking about.,The media and the Internet,love to rank cities.,And in Oklahoma City,,we'd never really been on lists before.,So I thought it was kind of cool,when they came out with thesenpositive lists and we were on there.,We weren't anywhere close to the top,,but we were on the list, we were somebody.,Best city to get a job,,best city to start a business,,best downtown --,Oklahoma City. 
 And then came the list,of the most obese cities in the country.,And there we were. 
 Now I like to point out that we were on that list,with a lot of really cool places.,(Laughter),Dallas and Houston and New Orleans,and Atlanta and Miami.,You know, these are cities that, typically,,you're not embarrassed to be associated with.,But nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list. 
 And about that time, I got on the scales.,And I weighed 220 pounds.,And then I went to this website,sponsored by the federal government,,and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,,and I pushed Enter,,and it came back and said "obese." 
 I thought, "What a stupid website.",(Laughter),"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese." 
 And then I started getting honest with myself,about what had becomenmy lifelong struggle with obesity,,and I noticed this pattern,,that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,,and then about every 10 years,nI'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.,And then I'd do it again.,And I had this huge closet full of clothes,,and I could only wear a third of it at any one time,,and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.,But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it. 
 Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,,and I knew I could becausenI'd done it so many times before,,so I simply stopped eating as much.,I had always exercised.,That really wasn't the part of the equation,that I needed to work on.,But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,,and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,,and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week,for about 40 weeks. 
 Along the way, though,,I started examining my city,,its culture, its infrastructure,,trying to figure out why our specific city,seemed to have a problem with obesity.,And I came to the conclusion,that we had built an incredible quality of life,if you happen to be a car.,(Laughter),But if you happen to be a person,,you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.,Our city is very spread out.,We have a great intersection of highways,,I mean, literally no traffic congestionnin Oklahoma City to speak of.,And so people live far, far away.,Our city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,,but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.,You literally can get a speeding ticket,during rush hour in Oklahoma City.,And as a result, people tend to spread out.,Land's cheap.,We had also not required developers,to build sidewalks on new developments nfor a long, long time.,We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,,and there were literally 100,000,or more homes into our inventory,in neighborhoods that had nvirtually no level of walkability. 
 And as I tried to examine,how we might deal with obesity,,and was taking all of these elements into my mind,,I decided that the first thing we need to do,was have a conversation.,You see, in Oklahoma City,,we weren't talking about obesity.,And so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,,I went to the zoo,,and I stood in front of the elephants,,and I said, "This city is going on a diet,,and we're going to lose a million pounds." 
 Well, that's when all hell broke loose. 
 (Laughter) 
 The national media,gravitated toward this story immediately,,and they really could have ngone with it one of two ways.,They could have said,,"This city is so fat,that the mayor had to put them on a diet.",But fortunately, the consensus was,,"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.,This is a city that's wantingnto do something about it.",And so they started helping us,drive traffic to the website.,Now, the web address was,thiscityisgoingonadiet.com.,And I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show",one weekday morning to talk about the initiative,,and on that day, 150,000 visits,were placed to our website.,People were signing up,,and so the pounds started to add up,,and the conversation that I thought,was so important to have was starting to take place.,It was taking place inside the homes,,mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.,It was taking place in churches.,Churches were starting their own running groups,and their own support groups,for people who were dealing with obesity.,Suddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools,and in the workplace.,And the large companies, they typically have,wonderful wellness programs,,but the medium-sized companies,that typically fall between the cracksnon issues like this,,they started to get engaged and used our program,as a model for their own employees,to try and have contests to see,who might be able to deal with their obesity situation,in a way that could be proactivelynbeneficial to others. 
 And then came the next stage of the equation.,It was time to push what I called MAPS 3.,Now MAPS 3, like the other two programs,,had had an economic development motive behind it,,but along with the traditionalneconomic development tasks,like building a new convention center,,we added some health-related infrastructure,to the process.,We added a new central park, 70 acres in size,,to be right downtown in Oklahoma City.,We're building a downtown streetcar,to try and help the walkability formula,for people who choose to live in the inner city,and help us create the density there.,We're building senior health and wellness centers,throughout the community.,We put some investments on the river,that had originally been invested upon,in the original MAPS,,and now we are currently in the final stages,of developing the finest venue in the world,for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.,We hosted the Olympic trials last spring.,We have Olympic-caliber eventsncoming to Oklahoma City,,and athletes from all over the world moving in,,along with inner city programs,to get kids more engaged in thesentypes of recreational activities,that are a little bit nontraditional.,We also, with another initiative that was passed,,are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks,throughout the metro area.,We're even going back into some,inner city situations,where we had built neighborhoods,and we had built schools,but we had not connected the two.,We had built libraries andnwe had built neighborhoods,,but we had never really connected the two,with any sort of walkability.,Through yet another funding source,,we're redesigning all of our inner city streets,to be more pedestrian-friendly.,Our streets were really wide,,and you'd push the buttonnto allow you to walk across,,and you had to run in order to get there in time.,But now we've narrowed the streets,,highly landscaped them, making themnmore pedestrian-friendly,,really a redesign, rethinking the way,we build our infrastructure,,designing a city around people and not cars.,We're completing our bicycle trail master plan.,We'll have over 100 miles,when we're through building it out. 
 And so you see this culture starting to shift,in Oklahoma City.,And lo and behold, the demographic changes,that are coming with it are very inspiring.,Highly educated twentysomethings,are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region,and, indeed, even from further away, in California. 
 When we reached a million pounds,,in January of 2012,,I flew to New York with some our participants,who had lost over 100 pounds,,whose lives had been changed,,and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,,and then that afternoon,nI did a round of media in New York,pushing the same messages,that you're accustomed to hearingnabout obesity and the dangers of it.,And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,,the same magazine that had put us on that list,five years before.,And as I'm sitting in the lobbynwaiting to talk to the reporter,,I notice there's a magazine copy,of the current issue right there on the table,,and I pick it up, and I look at the headline,across the top, and it says,,"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?",Well, I knew I did,,so I picked up the magazine,and I began to look,,and we weren't on it. 
 (Applause) 
 Then I looked on the list of fittest cities,,and we were on that list.,We were on the list as the 22ndnfittest city in the United States.,Our state health statistics are doing better.,Granted, we have a long way to go.,Health is still not something,that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,,but we seem to have turned the cultural shift,of making health a greater priority.,And we love the idea of the demographics,of highly educated twentysomethings,,people with choices, choosing Oklahoma City,in large numbers.,We have the lowest unemploymentnin the United States,,probably the strongest economy in the United States.,And if you're like me, at some point,in your educational career,,you were asked to read a book called,"The Grapes of Wrath.",Oklahomans leaving for California,in large numbers for a better future.,When we look at the demographic shifts,of people coming from the west,,it appears that what we're seeing now,is the wrath of grapes.,(Laughter),(Applause),The grandchildren are coming home. 
 You've been a great audience and very attentive.,Thank you very much for having me here. 
 (Applause)So my name is Amy Webb,,and a few years agonI found myself at the end,of yet another fantastic relationship,that came burning downnin a spectacular fashion.,And I thought, what's wrong with me?,I don't understandnwhy this keeps happening. 
 So I asked everybody in my lifenwhat they thought.,I turned to my grandmother,nwho always had plenty of advice,,and she said, "Stop being so picky.,You've got to date around.,And most importantly,,true love will find younwhen you least expect it." 
 Now as it turns out,,I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,,as you'll soon find.,I am constantly swimmingnin numbers, formulas and charts.,I also have a very tight-knit family,,and I'm very, very close with my sister,,and as a result, I wanted to haventhe same type of family when I grew up. 
 So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,,I'm 30 years old,,I figure I'm probably going to havento date somebody for about six months,before I'm ready to get monogamous,and before we can sort of cohabitate,,and we have to do thatnfor a while before we can get engaged.,And if I want to start having childrennby the time I'm 35,,that meant that I would havenhad to have been on my way to marriage,five years ago.,So that wasn't going to work. 
 If my strategy was to least-expectnmy way into true love,,then the variable that I hadnto deal with was serendipity.,In short, I was trying to figure out,what's the probabilitynof my finding Mr. Right?,Well, at the time I was livingnin the city of Philadelphia,,and it's a big city, and I figured,,in this entire place,nthere are lots of possibilities.,So again, I started doing some math.,Population of Philadelphia:nit has 1.5 million people.,I figure about half of that are men,,so that takes the number down to 750,000.,I'm looking for a guynbetween the ages of 30 and 36,,which was only four percentnof the population,,so now I'm dealingnwith the possibility of 30,000 men.,I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,,because I am and that was important to me.,That's only 2.3 percent of the population.,I figure I'm attracted to maybenone out of 10 of those men,,and there was no way I was going to dealnwith somebody who was an avid golfer.,So that basically meantnthere were 35 men for me,that I could possibly date,in the entire city of Philadelphia. 
 In the meantime,nmy very large Jewish family,was already all marriednand well on their way,to having lots and lots of children,,and I felt like I wasnunder tremendous peer pressure,to get my life going already. 
 So I have two possiblenstrategies at this point,I'm sort of figuring out.,One, I can take my grandmother's advice,and sort of least-expect my way,into maybe bumping into the onenout of 35 possible men,in the entire 1.5-million-personncity of Philadelphia,,or I could try online dating. 
 Now, I like the idea of online dating,,because it's predicated on an algorithm,,and that's really justna simple way of saying,I've got a problem,nI'm going to use some data,,run it through a systemnand get to a solution.,So online dating is the secondnmost popular way,that people now meet each other,,but as it turns out,nalgorithms have been around,for thousands of yearsnin almost every culture.,In fact, in Judaism,nthere were matchmakers a long time ago,,and though they didn't havenan explicit algorithm per se,,they definitely were runningnthrough formulas in their heads,,like, is the girl going to like the boy?,Are the families going to get along?,What's the rabbi going to say?,Are they going to startnhaving children right away?,The matchmaker would sortnof think through all of this,,put two people together,nand that would be the end of it.,So in my case, I thought,,well, will data and an algorithmnlead me to my Prince Charming?,So I decided to sign on. 
 Now, there was one small catch.,As I'm signing on to the variousndating websites,,as it happens, I was really, really busy.,But that actuallynwasn't the biggest problem.,The biggest problem is that I hatenfilling out questionnaires of any kind,,and I certainly don't like questionnairesnthat are like Cosmo quizzes.,So I just copiednand pasted from my résumé. 
 (Laughter) 
 So in the descriptive part up top,,I said that I wasnan award-winning journalist,and a future thinker.,When I was asked about fun activitiesnand my ideal date,,I said monetizationnand fluency in Japanese.,I talked a lot about JavaScript. 
 (Laughter) 
 So obviously this was not the best waynto put my most sexy foot forward.,But the real failure was thatnthere were plenty of men for me to date.,These algorithms had a sea full of men,that wanted to take me outnon lots of dates --,what turned out to be truly awful dates. 
 There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.,The algorithm matched us upnbecause we share a love of gadgets,,we share a love of mathnand data and '80s music,,and so I agreed to go out with him.,So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out,to one of Philadelphia'snwhite-table-cloth,,extremely expensive restaurants.,And we went in, and right off the bat,,our conversation reallynwasn't taking flight,,but he was ordering a lot of food.,In fact, he didn't even bothernlooking at the menu.,He was ordering multiple appetizers,nmultiple entrées, for me as well,,and suddenly there are pilesnand piles of food on our table,,also lots and lots of bottles of wine.,So we're nearing the endnof our conversation,and the end of dinner, and I've decided,Steve the I.T. guy and I are reallynjust not meant for each other,,but we'll part ways as friends,,when he gets up to go to the bathroom,,and in the meantime,nthe bill comes to our table.,And listen, I'm a modern woman.,I am totally down with splitting the bill.,But then Steve the I.T. guyndidn't come back. 
 (Gasping) 
 And that was my entire month's rent. 
 (Audience gasps) 
 So needless to say,nI was not having a good night.,So I run home, I callnmy mother, I call my sister,,and as I do, at the end of each onenof these terrible, terrible dates,,I regale them with the details.,And they say to me,,"Stop complaining." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You're just being too picky." 
 So I said, fine, from here on outnI'm only going on dates,where I know there's Wi-Fi,nand I'm bringing my laptop.,I'm going to shove it into my bag,,I'm going to have this email template,,and I'm going to fill it outnand collect information,on all these differentndata points during the date,to prove to everybody that empirically,,these dates really are terrible. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I started tracking things likenreally stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;,bad vocabulary;,the number of times a mannforced me to high-five him. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I started to crunch some numbers,,and that allowed mento make some correlations.,So as it turns out,,for some reason, men who drink Scotchnreference kinky sex immediately. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, it turns outnthat these probably weren't bad guys.,There were just bad for me.,And as it happens, the algorithmsnthat were setting us up,,they weren't bad either.,These algorithms were doing exactlynwhat they were designed to do,,which was to takenour user-generated information,,in my case, my résumé,,and match it upnwith other people's information.,See, the real problem here is that,,while the algorithms work just fine,,you and I don't,,when confronted with blank windows,where we're supposed to inputnour information online.,Very few of us have the ability,to be totally and brutallynhonest with ourselves.,The other problemnis that these websites are asking us,questions like, are youna dog person or a cat person?,Do you like horror films or romance films?,I'm not looking for a pen pal.,I'm looking for a husband. Right?,So there's a certain amountnof superficiality in that data. 
 So I said fine, I've got a new plan.,I'm going to keep usingnthese online dating sites,,but I'm going to treat them as databases,,and rather than waitingnfor an algorithm to set me up,,I think I'm going to trynreverse-engineering this entire system.,So knowing that there was superficial data,that was being usednto match me up with other people,,I decided instead to ask my own questions.,What was every single possible thing,that I could think ofnthat I was looking for in a mate? 
 So I started writing,and writing and writing,,and at the end, I had amassedn72 different data points.,I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,,so I was looking for somebody,who had the same backgroundnand thoughts on our culture,,but wasn't going to force me to go to shulnevery Friday and Saturday.,I wanted somebody who worked hard,,because work for menis extremely important,,but not too hard.,For me, the hobbies that I have,are really just new work projectsnthat I've launched.,I also wanted somebodynwho not only wanted two children,,but was going to have the samenattitude toward parenting that I do,,so somebody who was goingnto be totally okay,with forcing our child to startntaking piano lessons at age three,,and also maybe computer science classesnif we could wrangle it.,So things like that,nbut I also wanted somebody,who would go to far-flung,nexotic places, like Petra, Jordan.,I also wanted somebody who would weighn20 pounds more than me at all times,,regardless of what I weighed. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I now haventhese 72 different data points,,which, to be fair, is a lot.,So what I did was, I went throughnand I prioritized that list.,I broke it into a top tiernand a second tier of points,,and I ranked everything starting at 100,and going all the way down to 91,,and listing things like I was lookingnfor somebody who was really smart,,who would challenge and stimulate me,,and balancing that with a second tiernand a second set of points.,These things were also important to menbut not necessarily deal-breakers. 
 (Laughter) 
 So once I had all this done,nI then built a scoring system,,because what I wanted to donwas to sort of mathematically calculate,whether or not I thoughtnthe guy that I found online,would be a match with me.,I figured there would bena minimum of 700 points,before I would agree to email somebodynor respond to an email message.,For 900 points,nI'd agree to go out on a date,,and I wouldn't even considernany kind of relationship,before somebody had crossednthe 1,500 point threshold. 
 Well, as it turns out,nthis worked pretty well.,So I go back online now.,I found Jewishdoc57,who's incredibly good-looking,nincredibly well-spoken,,he had hiked Mt. Fuji,,he had walked along the Great Wall.,He likes to travel,as long as it doesn't involvena cruise ship.,And I thought,,I've done it!,I've cracked the code.,I have just foundnthe Jewish Prince Charming,of my family's dreams. 
 There was only one problem:,He didn't like me back.,And I guess the one variablenthat I haven't considered,is the competition.,Who are all of the other womennon these dating sites?,I found SmileyGirl1978.,She said she was a "Fun girlnwho is Happy and Outgoing.",She listed her job as "teacher.",She said she isn"silly, nice and friendly.",She likes to make people laugh "alot." 
 At this moment I knew,,clicking profile after profilenthat looked like this,,that I needed to do some market research.,So I created 10 fake male profiles.,Now, before I lose all of you -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 understand that I did thisnstrictly to gather data,about everybody else in the system.,I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-stylenrelationships with anybody.,I really was just scraping their data.,But I didn't want everybody's data.,I only wanted data on the womennwho were going to be attracted,to the type of man that I really,nreally wanted to marry. 
 When I released these men into the wild,,I did follow some rules.,So I didn't reach out to any woman first.,I just waited to seenwho these profiles were going to attract,,and mainly what I was looking atnwas two different data sets.,So I was looking at qualitative data,,so what was the humor, the tone,,the voice, the communication style,that these women shared in common?,And also quantitative data,,so what was the average lengthnof their profile,,how much time was spent between messages?,What I was trying to get at here wasnthat I figured, in person,,I would be just as competitivenas a SmileyGirl1978.,I wanted to figure out how to maximizenmy own profile online. 
 Well, one month later,,I had a lot of data,nand I was able to do another analysis.,And as it turns out,ncontent matters a lot.,So smart people tend to write a lot --,3,000, 4,000, 5,000 wordsnabout themselves,,which may all be very, very interesting.,The challenge here, though,nis that the popular men and women,are sticking to 97 words on average,that are written very, very well,,even though it may not seemnlike it all the time.,The other hallmarknof the people who do this well,is that they're usingnnon-specific language.,So in my case,,"The English Patient"nis my most favorite movie ever,,but it doesn't worknto use that in a profile,,because that's a superficial data point,,and somebody may disagree,and decide they don't want to go out,because they didn't likensitting through the three-hour movie. 
 Also, optimistic language matters a lot.,So this is a word cloud,highlighting the most popularnwords that were used,by the most popular women,,words like "fun" and "girl" and "love.",And what I realized was notnthat I had to dumb down my own profile.,Remember, I'm somebody who said,that I speak fluent Japanesenand I know JavaScript,and I was okay with that.,The difference is that it's about beingnmore approachable,and helping people understandnthe best way to reach out to you. 
 And as it turns out, timingnis also really, really important.,Just because you have accessnto somebody's mobile phone number,or their instant message account,and it's 2 o'clock in the morningnand you happen to be awake,,doesn't mean that that's a good timento communicate with those people.,The popular women on these online sites,spend an average of 23 hoursnin between each communication.,And that's what we would normally donin the usual process of courtship. 
 And finally --,there were the photos.,All of the women who were popularnshowed some skin.,They all looked really great,,which turned out to be in sharp contrast,to what I had uploaded. 
 (Laughter) 
 Once I had all of this information,,I was able to create a super profile,,so it was still me,,but it was me optimized nownfor this ecosystem.,And as it turns out,nI did a really good job.,I was the most popular person online. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And as it turns out, lots and lotsnof men wanted to date me.,So I call my mom, I call my sister,nI call my grandmother.,I'm telling them about this fabulous news,,and they say, "This is wonderful!nHow soon are you going out?",I said, "Actually, I'm not goingnto go out with anybody.",Because remember, in my scoring system,,they have to reach a minimumnthreshold of 700 points,,and none of them have done that.,They said, "What?nYou're still being too damn picky." 
 Well, not too long after that,nI found this guy, Thevenin,,and he said that he was culturally Jewish,,he said that his jobnwas an arctic baby seal hunter,,which I thought was very clever.,He talked in detail about travel.,He made a lot of reallyninteresting cultural references.,He looked and talked exactlynlike what I wanted,,and immediately, he scored 850 points.,It was enough for a date. 
 Three weeks later, we met up in person,for what turned out to bena 14-hour-long conversation,that went from coffee shop to restaurant,to another coffee shopnto another restaurant,,and when he dropped me back offnat my house that night,I re-scored him -- 
 [1,050 points!] 
 Thought, you know what,,this entire time,nI haven't been picky enough.,Well, a year and a half after that,,we were non-cruise ship traveling,through Petra, Jordan,,when he got down on his knee and proposed.,A year after that, we were married,,and about a year and a half after that,,our daughter, Petra, was born. 
 Audience: Oh! 
 (Applause) 
 [What it means...] 
 Obviously, I'm havingna fabulous life, so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 The question is, what doesnall of this mean for you? 
 Well, as it turns out,nthere is an algorithm for love.,It's just not the onesnthat we're being presented with online.,In fact, it's somethingnthat you write yourself.,So whether you're lookingnfor a husband or a wife,or you're trying to find your passion,or you're trying to start a business,,all you have to really donis figure out your own framework,and play by your own rules,,and feel free to be as picky as you want. 
 Well, on my wedding day,,I had a conversation againnwith my grandmother,,and she said, "All right,nmaybe I was wrong.,It looks like you did come upnwith a really, really great system.,Now, your matzah balls ...,They should be fluffy, not hard." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'll take her advice on that. 
 (Applause)This is an ambucycle.,This is the fastest waynto reach any medical emergency.,It has everything an ambulancenhas except for a bed.,You see the defibrillator.nYou see the equipment.,We all saw the tragedynthat happened in Boston.,When I was looking at these pictures,,it brought me back many years to my past,when I was a child.,I grew up in a smallnneighborhood in Jerusalem.,When I was six years old,nI was walking back from school,on a Friday afternoonnwith my older brother.,We were passing by a bus stop.,We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.,The bus was on fire, and many peoplenwere hurt and killed.,I remembered an old man,yelling to us and cryingnto help us get him up.,He just needed someone helping him.,We were so scared and we just ran away.,Growing up, I decided I wantednto become a doctor and save lives.,Maybe that was because of what I sawnwhen I was a child.,When I was 15, I took an EMT course,,and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.,For two years, I volunteerednon an ambulance in Jerusalem.,I helped many people,,but whenever someone really needed help,,I never got there in time.nWe never got there.,The traffic is so bad. Thendistance, and everything.,We never got there whennsomebody really needed us.,One day, we received a callnabout a seven-year-old child,choking from a hot dog.,Traffic was horrific,nand we were coming from,the other side of townnin the north part of Jerusalem.,When we got there, 20 minutes later,,we started CPR on the kid.,A doctor comes in from a block away,,stop us, checks the kid,nand tells us to stop CPR.,That second he declared this child dead.,At that moment, I understood,that this child died for nothing.,If this doctor, who livednone block away from there,,would have come 20 minutes earlier,,not have to waitnuntil that siren he heard before,coming from the ambulance,,if he would have heardnabout it way before,,he would have saved this child.,He could have run from a block away.,He could have saved this child.,I said to myself, therenmust be a better way.,Together with 15 of my friends --,we were all EMTs —,we decided, let's protectnour neighborhood,,so when something like that happens again,,we will be there running to the scenena lot before the ambulance.,So I went over to the managernof the ambulance company,and I told him, "Please,nwhenever you have a call,coming into our neighborhood,,we have 15 great guys who are willing,to stop everything they'rendoing and run and save lives.,Just alert us by beeper.,We'll buy these beepers,njust tell your dispatch,to send us the beeper,nand we will run and save lives.",Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.nI was a kid.,And he said to me — I remembernthis like yesterday —,he was a great guy, but he said to me,,"Kid, go to school, or gonopen a falafel stand.,We're not really interestednin these kinds of new adventures.,We're not interested in your help."nAnd he threw me out of the room.,"I don't need your help," he said.,I was a very stubborn kid.,As you see now, I'm walkingnaround like crazy, meshugenah.,(Laughter) (Applause),So I decided to use the Israelinvery famous technique,you've probably all heard of, chutzpah.n(Laughter),And the next day, I wentnand I bought two police scanners,,and I said, "The hellnwith you, if you don't want,to give me information, I'll getnthe information myself.",And we did turns, who's goingnto listen to the radio scanners.,The next day, while I was listeningnto the scanners,,I heard about a call comingnin of a 70-year-old man,hurt by a car only one block away from me,on the main street of my neighborhood.,I ran there by foot. I hadnno medical equipment.,When I got there, the 70-year-old man,was lying on the floor, bloodnwas gushing out of his neck.,He was on Coumadin.,I knew I had to stop his bleedingnor else he would die.,I took off my yarmulke,nbecause I had no medical equipment,,and with a lot of pressure,nI stopped his bleeding.,He was bleeding from his neck.,When the ambulance arrivedn15 minutes later,,I gave them over a patient who was alive.,(Applause),When I went to visit him two days later,,he gave me a hug and was crying,and thanking me for saving his life.,At that moment, when I realizednthis is the first person,I ever saved in my life after two yearsnvolunteering in an ambulance,,I knew this is my life's mission.,So today, 22 years later,nwe have United Hatzalah.,(Applause),"Hatzalah" means "rescue,"nfor all of you who don't know Hebrew.,I forgot I'm not in Israel.,So we have thousands of volunteers,who are passionate about saving lives,,and they're spread all around,nso whenever a call comes in,,they just stop everythingnand go and run and save a life.,Our average response time today,went down to lessnthan three minutes in Israel.,(Applause),I'm talking about heart attacks,,I'm talking about car accidents,,God forbid bomb attacks,nshootings, whatever it is,,even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning,falling in her home and needsnsomeone to help her.,Three minutes, we'll havena guy with his pajamas,running to her housenand helping her get up.,The reasons why we're so successfulnare because of three things.,Thousands of passionate volunteers,who will leave everything they do,and run to help peoplenthey don't even know.,We're not there to replace ambulances.,We're just there,to get the gap between the ambulancencall until they arrive.,And we save people that otherwisenwould not be saved.,The second reasonnis because of our technology.,You know, Israelis are good in technology.,Every one of us has on his phone,nno matter what kind of phone,,a GPS technology done by NowForce,,and whenever a call comes in,,the closest five volunteers get the call,,and they actually get there really quick,,and navigated by a traffic navigatornto get there and not waste time.,And this is a great technologynwe use all over the country,and reduce the response time.,And the third thing are these ambucycles.,These ambucyclesnare an ambulance on two wheels.,We don't transfer people,nbut we stabilize them,,and we save their lives.,They never get stuck in traffic.nThey could even go on a sidewalk.,They never, literally,nget stuck in traffic.,That's why we get there so fast.,A few years after I startednthis organization,,in a Jewish community,,two Muslims from eastnJerusalem called me up.,They ask me to meet. Theynwanted to meet with me.,Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.,When Muhammad told me his personal story,,how his father, 55 yearsnold, collapsed at home,,had a cardiac arrest,,and it took over an hournfor an ambulance arrive,,and he saw his father dienin front of his eyes,,he asked me, "Please startnthis in east Jerusalem.",I said to myself, I saw sonmuch tragedy, so much hate,,and it's not about saving Jews.nIt's not about saving Muslims.,It's not about saving Christians.nIt's about saving people.,So I went ahead, full force --,(Applause) —,and I started UnitednHatzalah in east Jerusalem,,and that's why the names United,and Hatzalah match so well.,We started hand in handnsaving Jews and Arabs.,Arabs were saving Jews.nJews were saving Arabs.,Something special happened.,Arabs and Jews, they don'tnalways get along together,,but here in this situation,,the communities, literally,,it's an unbelievablensituation that happened,,the diversities, all of a suddennthey had a common interest:,Let's save lives together.,Settlers were saving Arabsnand Arabs were saving settlers.,It's an unbelievablenconcept that could work,only when you have such a great cause.,And these are all volunteers.,No one is getting money.,They're all doing itnfor the purpose of saving lives.,When my own fatherncollapsed a few years ago,from a cardiac arrest,none of the first volunteers,to arrive to save my father,was one of these Muslimnvolunteers from east Jerusalem,who was in the firstncourse to join Hatzalah.,And he saved my father.,Could you imaginenhow I felt in that moment?,When I started this organization,nI was 17 years old.,I never imagined that one daynI'd be speaking at TEDMED.,I never even knew what TEDMED was then.,I don't think it existed,nbut I never imagined,,I never imagined that it's goingnto go all around,,it's going to spread around,,and this last year we startednin Panama and Brazil.,All I need is a partnernwho is a little meshugenah like me,,passionate about savingnlives, and willing to do it.,And I'm actually startingnit in India very soon,with a friend who I metnin Harvard just a while back.,Hatzalah actually startednin Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew,years before us in Williamsburg,,and now it's all over the Jewishncommunity in New York,,even Australia and Mexiconand many other Jewish communities.,But it could spread everywhere.,It's very easy to adopt.,You even saw these volunteers in New York,saving lives in the World Trade Center.,Last year alone, we treatednin Israel 207,000 people.,Forty-two thousand of them werenlife-threatening situations.,And we made a difference.,I guess you could call thisna lifesaving flash mob,,and it works.,When I look all around here,,I see lots of peoplenwho would go an extra mile,,run an extra mile to save other people,,no matter who they are,nno matter what religion,,no matter who, where they come from.,We all want to be heroes.,We just need a good idea, motivation,and lots of chutzpah,,and we could save millions of people,that otherwise would not be saved.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,,and following my training,,I moved to Somalia,from San Francisco.,And my goodbye greeting,from the chief of infectious diseases,at San Francisco General was,,"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make." 
 But I landed in a refugee situation,that had a million refugees in 40 camps,,and there were six of us doctors.,There were many epidemics there.,My responsibilities were largely related to,tuberculosis,,and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.,So it was the spread of tuberculosis,and the spread of cholera,that I was responsible for inhibiting.,And in order to do this work, we, of course,,because of the limitation in health workers,,had to recruit refugees to be a specialized,new category of health worker.,Following three years of work in Somalia,,I got picked up by the World Health Organization,,and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.,My primary responsibility was Uganda,,but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi,and Zaire, now Congo,,Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.,And my last assignment there was to run a unit,called intervention development,,which was responsible for designing interventions. 
 After 10 years of working overseas,,I was exhausted.,I really had very little left.,I had been traveling to one country after another.,I was emotionally feeling very isolated.,I wanted to come home.,I'd seen a lot of death,,in particular epidemic death,,and epidemic death has a different feel to it.,It's full of panic and fear,,and I'd heard the women wailing and crying,in the desert.,And I wanted to come home and take a break,and maybe start over. 
 I was not aware of any epidemic problems,in America.,In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.,In fact -- seriously.,And in fact I would visit friends of mine,,and I noticed that they had water,that came right into their homes.,How many of you have such a situation?,(Laughter),And some of them, many of them actually,,had water that came into more than one room.,And I noticed that they would move,this little thermoregulatory device,to change the temperature in their home,by one degree or two degrees.,And now I do that. 
 And I really didn't know what I would do,,but friends of mine began telling me,about children shooting other children with guns.,And I asked the question,,what are you doing about it?,What are you in America doing about it?,And there were two essential explanations,or ideas that were prevalent. 
 And one was punishment.,And this I had heard about before.,We who had worked in behavior,knew that punishment was something that was discussed,but also that it was highly overvalued.,It was not a main driver of behavior,,nor was it a main driver of behavior change.,And besides that, it reminded me,of ancient epidemics,that were previously completely misunderstood,because the science hadn't been there before,,epidemics of plague,or typhus or leprosy,,where the prevalent ideas were that there were,bad people or bad humors or bad air,,and widows were dragged around the moat,,and dungeons were part of the solution. 
 The other explanation or, in a way,,the solution suggested,,is please fix all of these things:,the schools, the community, the homes, the families,,everything.,And I'd heard this before as well.,I'd called this the "everything" theory,,or EOE: Everything On Earth.,But we'd also realized,in treating other processes and problems,that sometimes you don't need to treat everything. 
 And so the sense that I had,was there was a giant gap here.,The problem of violence was stuck,,and this has historically been the case,in many other issues.,Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.,Malaria had been stuck.,Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.,It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,,but there was a sense that we would have to do,something with new categories of workers,and something having to do with behavior change,and something having to do with public education. 
 But I began to ask questions,and search out the usual things,that I had been exploring before,,like, what do the maps look like?,What do the graphs look like?,What does the data look like?,And the maps of violence,in most U.S. cities,looked like this.,There was clustering.,This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also,in infectious epidemics,,for example cholera.,And then we looked at the maps,,and the maps showed this typical wave,upon wave upon wave,,because all epidemics,are combinations of many epidemics.,And it also looked like infectious epidemics.,And then we asked the question,,well what really predicts a case of violence?,And it turns out that the greatest predictor,of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.,Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,,someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,,or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis,is having been exposed to tuberculosis. 
 And so we see that violence is, in a way,,behaving like a contagious disease.,We're aware of this anyway,even in our common experiences,or our newspaper stories,of the spread of violence from fights,or in gang wars or in civil wars,or even in genocides. 
 And so there's good news about this, though,,because there's a way to reverse epidemics,,and there's really only three things that are done,to reverse epidemics,,and the first of it is interrupting transmission.,In order to interrupt transmission,,you need to detect and find first cases.,In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody,who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.,Make sense?,And there's special workers for doing that.,For this particular problem,,we designed a new category of worker,who, like a SARS worker,or someone looking for bird flu,,might find first cases.,In this case, it's someone who's very angry,because someone looked at his girlfriend,or owes him money,,and you can find workers and train them,into these specialized categories. 
 And the second thing to do, of course,,is to prevent further spread,,that means to find who else has been exposed,,but may not be spreading so much right now,like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,,or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,,but in the same group,,and then they need to be, in a way,,managed as well,,particular to the specific disease process. 
 And then the third part, the shifting the norms,,and that means a whole bunch of community activities,,remodeling, public education,,and then you've got what you might call,group immunity.,And that combination of factors,is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda,was very successfully reversed. 
 And so what we decided to do in the year 2000,is kind of put this together in a way,by hiring in new categories of workers,,the first being violence interruptors.,And then we would put all of this into place,in one neighborhood,in what was the worst police district,in the United States at the time.,So violence interruptors hired from the same group,,credibility, trust, access,,just like the health workers in Somalia,,but designed for a different category,,and trained in persuasion,,cooling people down, buying time, reframing.,And then another category of worker,,the outreach workers, to keep people,in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.,Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.,And then a bunch of community activities,for changing norms. 
 Now our first experiment of this,resulted in a 67-percent drop,in shootings and killings,in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago. 
 (Applause) 
 And this was a beautiful thing,for the neighborhood itself,,first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,,and then there was unfortunately another shooting,in another 90 days,,and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.,They were using parks they weren't using before.,The sun was out. Everybody was happy. 
 But of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,,do it again.",And so we had to then, fortunately,,get the funds to repeat this experience,,and this is one of the next four neighborhoods,that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.,And since that time, this has been replicated,20 times.,There have been independent evaluations,supported by the Justice Department,and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins,that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent,reductions in shootings and killings,using this new method.,In fact, there have been three independent,evaluations of this now. 
 Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,,including being featured on,The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.,The Economist in 2009,said this is "the approach that will come to prominence.",And even a movie was made around our work.,[The Interrupters] 
 However, not so fast,,because a lot of people did not agree,with this way of going about it.,We got a lot of criticism,,a lot of opposition,,and a lot of opponents.,In other words, what do you mean, health problem?,What do you mean, epidemic?,What do you mean, no bad guys?,And there's whole industries designed,for managing bad people.,What do you mean, hiring people,who have backgrounds?,My business friends said,,"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.,You must be doing something right." 
 (Laughter) 
 My musician friends added the word "dude." 
 So anyway, additionally,,there was still this problem,,and we were getting highly criticized as well,for not dealing with all of these other problems.,Yet we were able to manage malaria,and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases,in places with awful economies,without healing the economy. 
 So what's actually happened is,,although there is still some opposition,,the movement is clearly growing.,Many of the major cities in the U.S.,,including New York City and Baltimore,and Kansas City,,their health departments are running this now.,Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments,are having a very large role in this.,This is being embraced more by law enforcement,than it had been years ago.,Trauma centers and hospitals,are doing their part in stepping up.,And the U.S. Conference of Mayors,has endorsed not only the approach,but the specific model.,Where there's really been uptake even faster,is in the international environment,,where there's a 55-percent drop,in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,,where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,,where the strategy has been applied in Kenya,for the recent elections,,and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq. 
 So violence is responding as a disease,even as it behaves as a disease.,So the theory, in a way,,is kind of being validated by the treatment.,And recently, the Institute of Medicine,came out with a workshop report,which went through some of the data,,including the neuroscience,,on how this problem is really transmitted. 
 So I think this is good news,,because it allows us an opportunity,to come out of the Middle Ages,,which is where I feel this field has been.,It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility,of replacing some of these prisons,with playgrounds or parks,,and to consider the possibility,of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,,and to allow there to be a new strategy,,a new set of methods, a new set of workers:,science, in a way, replacing morality.,And moving away from emotions,is the most important part of the solution,to science as a more important part of the solution. 
 So I didn't mean to come up with this at all.,It was a matter of,,I wanted actually a break,,and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,,we asked some questions,and tried some tools,that actually have been used many times before,for other things.,For myself, I tried to get away from,infectious diseases,,and I didn't. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I think it's safe to say,that all humans will be intimate with death,at least once in their lives.,But what if that intimacy began,long before you faced your own transition,from life into death?,What would life be like,if the dead literally lived alongside you? 
 In my husband's homeland,in the highlands of Sulawesi island,in eastern Indonesia,,there is a community of people that experience death,not as a singular event,but as a gradual social process.,In Tana Toraja,,the most important social moments in people's lives,,the focal points of social and cultural interaction,are not weddings or births or even family dinners,,but funerals.,So these funerals are characterized,by elaborate rituals,that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt,based on the amount of animals --,pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo --,that are sacrificed and distributed,in the name of the deceased.,So this cultural complex surrounding death,,the ritual enactment of the end of life,,has made death the most visible,and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.,Lasting anywhere from a few days,to a few weeks,,funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair,,where commemorating someone who's died,is not so much a private sadness,but more of a publicly shared transition.,And it's a transition that's just as much,about the identity of the living,as it is about remembrance of the dead. 
 So every year, thousands of visitors,come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,,this culture of death,,and for many people these grandiose ceremonies,and the length of the ceremonies,are somehow incommensurable,with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.,So even as we share death as a universal experience,,it's not experienced the same way the world over.,And as an anthropologist,,I see these differences in experience,being rooted in the cultural and social world,through which we define the phenomena around us.,So where we see an unquestionable reality,,death as an irrefutable biological condition,,Torajans see the expired corporeal form,as part of a larger social genesis.,So again, the physical cessation of life,is not the same as death.,In fact, a member of society is only truly dead,when the extended family can agree upon,and marshal the resources necessary,to hold a funeral ceremony,that is considered appropriate in terms of resources,for the status of the deceased.,And this ceremony has to take place,in front of the eyes of the whole community,with everyone's participation. 
 So after a person's physical death,,their body is placed in a special room,in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.,And the tongkonan is symbolic,not only of the family's identity,but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.,So essentially, the shape of the building,that you're born into is the shape,of the structure which carries you,to your ancestral resting place.,Until the funeral ceremony,,which can be held years after a person's physical death,,the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,,or "to mama," a person who is asleep,,and they continue to be a member of the household.,They are symbolically fed and cared for,,and the family at this time,will begin a number of ritual injunctions,,which communicates to the wider community around them,that one of their members is undergoing the transition,from this life into the afterlife,known as Puya. 
 So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.,Is she really saying that these people live,with the bodies of their dead relatives?,And that's exactly what I'm saying. 
 But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction,we have to this idea of proximity to bodies,,proximity to death,,or how this notion just does not fit,into our very biological or medical,sort of definition of death,,I like to think about what the Torajan way,of viewing death encompasses of the human experience,that the medical definition leaves out.,I think that Torajans socially recognize,and culturally express,what many of us feel to be true,despite the widespread acceptance,of the biomedical definition of death,,and that is that our relationships with other humans,,their impact on our social reality,,doesn't cease with the termination,of the physical processes of the body,,that there's a period of transition,as the relationship between the living and the dead,is transformed but not ended.,So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship,by lavishing love and attention,on the most visible symbol of that relationship,,the human body.,So my husband has fond memories,of talking to and playing with,and generally being around his deceased grandfather,,and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.,This is a natural part of the process,as the family comes to terms with the transition,in their relationship to the deceased,,and this is the transition from relating to the deceased,as a person who's living,to relating to the deceased,as a person who's an ancestor.,And here you can see these wooden effigies,of the ancestors,,so these are people who have already been buried,,already had a funeral ceremony.,These are called tau tau. 
 So the funeral ceremony itself,embodies this relational perspective on death.,It ritualizes the impact of death on families,and communities.,And it's also a moment of self-awareness.,It's a moment when people think about who they are,,their place in society,,and their role in the life cycle,in accordance with Torajan cosmology. 
 There's a saying in Toraja,that all people will become grandparents,,and what this means is that after death,,we all become part of the ancestral line,that anchors us between the past and the present,and will define who our loved ones are into the future.,So essentially, we all become grandparents,to the generations of human children,that come after us.,And this metaphor of membership,in the greater human family,is the way that children also describe,the money that they invest,in these sacrificial buffaloes,that are thought to carry people's soul,from here to the afterlife,,and children will explain,that they will invest the money in this,because they want to repay their parents,the debt for all of the years their parents spent,investing and caring for them. 
 But the sacrifice of buffalo,and the ritual display of wealth,also exhibits the status of the deceased,,and, by extension, the deceased's family.,So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed,but also transformed,in a ritual drama that highlights,the most salient feature about death in this place:,its impact on life and the relationships of the living. 
 So all of this focus on death,doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire,to the ideal of a long life.,They engage in many practices,thought to confer good health,and survival to an advanced age.,But they don't put much stock,in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness,or in old age.,It's said in Toraja that everybody has,sort of a predetermined amount of life.,It's called the sunga'.,And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool,to its natural end. 
 So by having death as a part,of the cultural and social fabric of life,,people's everyday decisions about their health,and healthcare are affected.,The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,,Nenet Katcha,,is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.,And there are increasing signs,that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.,And his death will be greatly mourned.,But I know that my husband's family,looks forward to the moment,when they can ritually display,what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,,when they can ritually recount,his life's narrative,,weaving his story,into the history of their community.,His story is their story.,His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.,And it's a story that has no discernible beginning,,no foreseeable end.,It's a story that goes on,long after his body no longer does. 
 People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed,by participating in a culture,where the physical manifestations of death,greet us at every turn.,But I see something profoundly transformative,in experiencing death as a social process,and not just a biological one.,In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead,has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,,where decisions about how long to stretch,the thread of life are made based on our emotional,and social ties with the people around us,,not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.,We, like the Torajans,,base our decisions about life,on the meanings and the definitions,that we ascribe to death. 
 So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience,should run out and adopt the traditions,of the Torajans.,It might be a little bit difficult,to put into play in the United States.,But I want to ask what we can gain,from seeing physical death not only as a biological process,but as part of the greater human story.,What would it be like to look on,the expired human form with love,because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?,If we could expand our definition of death,to encompass life,,we could experience death as part of life,and perhaps face death,with something other than fear.,Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges,that are facing the U.S. healthcare system,,particularly in the end-of-life care,,is as simple as a shift in perspective,,and the shift in perspective in this case,would be to look at the social life of every death.,It might help us recognize that the way we limit,our conversation about death,to something that's medical or biological,is reflective of a larger culture that we all share,of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.,If we could entertain and value,other kinds of knowledge about life,,including other definitions of death,,it has the potential to change the discussions,that we have about the end of life.,It could change the way that we die,,but more importantly,,it could transform the way that we live. 
 (Applause)I teach chemistry. 
 (Explosion) 
 All right, all right.,So more than just explosions,,chemistry is everywhere.,Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out,just doing this over and over?,Some people nodding yes.,Recently, I showed this to my students,,and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.,The questions and conversations that followed,were fascinating.,Check out this video that Maddie,from my period three class sent me that evening. 
 (Clang) (Laughs) 
 Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher,,I love that she went home and continued to geek out,about this kind of ridiculous demonstration,that we did in class.,But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity,took her to a new level.,If you look inside that beaker,,you might see a candle.,Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon,to a new scenario. 
 You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's,are magnets that draw us towards our teachers,,and they transcend all technology,or buzzwords in education.,But if we place these technologies before student inquiry,,we can be robbing ourselves,of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.,For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom,to the screen of a mobile device,might save instructional time,,but if it is the focus of our students' experience,,it's the same dehumanizing chatter,just wrapped up in fancy clothing.,But if instead we have the guts,to confuse our students, perplex them,,and evoke real questions,,through those questions, we as teachers have information,that we can use to tailor robust,and informed methods of blended instruction. 
 So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside,,the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now,,and it took a life-threatening situation,to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching,and help me realize that student questions,are the seeds of real learning,,not some scripted curriculum,that gave them tidbits of random information. 
 In May of 2010, at 35 years old,,with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way,,I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm,at the base of my thoracic aorta.,This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email,from my doctor right there.,Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock --,absolutely freaked out, okay?,But I found surprising moments of comfort,in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.,Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it? 
 So when I asked him, he told me three things.,He said first, his curiosity drove him,to ask hard questions about the procedure,,about what worked and what didn't work.,Second, he embraced, and didn't fear,,the messy process of trial and error,,the inevitable process of trial and error.,And third, through intense reflection,,he gathered the information that he needed,to design and revise the procedure,,and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life. 
 Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,,and before I went back into the classroom that fall,,I wrote down three rules of my own,that I bring to my lesson planning still today.,Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.,Questions can be windows to great instruction,,but not the other way around.,Rule number two: Embrace the mess.,We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.,And just because the scientific method is allocated,to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one,of the one that we all skip, okay,,trial and error can still be an informal part,of what we do every single day,at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.,And rule number three: Practice reflection.,What we do is important. It deserves our care,,but it also deserves our revision.,Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?,As if what we are doing one day will save lives.,Our students our worth it.,And each case is different. 
 (Explosion) 
 All right. Sorry.,The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that,out of my system before we move on. 
 So these are my daughters.,On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.,And, on the left, Riley.,Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.,She's going to be four years old,,and anyone who knows a four-year-old,knows that they love to ask, "Why?",Yeah. Why.,I could teach this kid anything,because she is curious about everything.,We all were at that age.,But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers,,the ones she has yet to meet.,How will they grow this curiosity? 
 You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,,and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms --,to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun,or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.,But if we as educators leave behind,this simple role as disseminators of content,and embrace a new paradigm,as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,,we just might bring a little bit more meaning,to their school day, and spark their imagination. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I'd like you to come back with me,just for a few minutes,to a dark night in China,,the night I met my husband.,It was a city so long ago that it was still called,Peking. 
 So I went to a party.,I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man,with owl glasses and a bow tie,,and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,,there in China specifically to study,Sino-Soviet relations.,What a gift it was to the eager,,young foreign correspondent that I was then.,I'd pump him for information,,I'm mentally scribbling notes,for the stories I plan to write.,I talk to him for hours. 
 Only months later,,I discover who he really was.,He was the China representative,for the American Soybean Association. 
 "I don't understand. Soybeans?,You told me you were a Fulbright scholar." 
 "Well, how long would you have talked to me,if I told you we're in soybeans?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "You jerk.",Only jerk wasn't the word I used.,I said, "You could've gotten me fired." 
 And he said, "Let's get married.",(Laughter),"Travel the world and have lots of kids.",So we did. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley,turned out to be.,He was a Chinese scholar,who later, in his 60s,,got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.,He spoke six languages,,he played 15 musical instruments,,he was a licensed pilot,,he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,,he was an expert in swine nutrition,,dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,,and we did travel the country, and the world,,and we did have a lot of kids.,We followed my job, and it seemed like,there was nothing that we couldn't do. 
 So when we found the cancer,,it doesn't seem strange to us at all,that without saying a word to each other,,we believed that,,if we were smart enough,and strong enough and brave enough,,and we worked hard enough,,we could keep him from dying ever. 
 And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.,The surgeon emerged from the surgery.,What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:,"We got it all.",Then there was a setback when the pathologists,looked at the kidney cancer closely.,It turned out to be a rare,,exceedingly aggressive type,,with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal,in several weeks at most.,And yet, he did not die.,Mysteriously, he lived on.,He coached Little League for our son.,He built a playhouse for our daughter.,And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet,looking for specialists.,I'm looking for a cure. 
 So a year goes by,before the cancer, as cancers do,,reappears,,and with it comes another death sentence,,this time nine months.,So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.,It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,,yet still he lives on.,Then another year goes by.,Two years go by.,More specialists.,We take the kids to Italy.,We take the kids to Australia. 
 And then more years pass,,and the cancer begins to grow.,This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.,They're exotic. They're experimental.,They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.,So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.,The cancer begins to shrink,,and for the third time,,we've dodged death. 
 So now I ask you,,how do I feel,when the time finally comes,and there's another dark night,,sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?,This time it's on the intensive care ward,when a twentysomething resident,that I've never met before,tells me that Terence is dying,,perhaps tonight. 
 So what do I say when he says,,"What do you want me to do?" 
 There's another drug out there.,It's newer. It's more powerful.,He started it just two weeks ago.,Perhaps there's still hope ahead. 
 So what do I say? 
 I say, "Keep him alive if you can." 
 And Terence died six days later. 
 So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.,It was an exhilarating fight,,and I'd repeat the fight today,without a moment's hesitation.,We fought together, we lived together.,It turned what could have been,seven of the grimmest years of our life,into seven of the most glorious.,It was also an expensive fight.,It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices,that everyone here agrees,pump up the cost of end-of-life care,,and of healthcare for all of us. 
 And for me, for us,,we pushed the fight right over the edge,,and I never got the chance to say to him,what I say to him now almost every day:,"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.",We never got the chance to say goodbye.,We never thought it was the end.,We always had hope. 
 So what do we make of all of this? 
 Being a journalist, after Terence died,,I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope.",I wrote it because I wanted to know,why I did what I did,,why he did what he did,,why everyone around us did what they did. 
 And what did I discover?,Well, one of the things I discovered is that,experts think that one answer to,what I did at the end was a piece of paper,,the advance directive,,to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.,Yet I had that piece of paper.,We both did.,And they were readily available.,I had them right at hand.,Both of them said the same thing:,Do nothing if there is no further hope.,I knew Terence's wishes,as clearly and as surely as I knew my own. 
 Yet we never got to no further hope.,Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands,,we just kept redefining hope.,I believed I could keep him from dying,,and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen,so many people and have talked to so many people,who have felt exactly the same way.,Right up until days before his death,,I felt strongly,and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,,that I could keep him from dying ever. 
 Now, what do the experts call this?,They say it's denial.,It's a strong word, isn't it?,Yet I will tell you that denial,isn't even close to a strong enough word,to describe what those of us,facing the death of our loved ones go through. 
 And I hear the medical professionals say,,"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,,but the family's in denial.,The family won't listen to reason.,They're in denial.,How can they insist on this treatment at the end?,It's so clear, yet they're in denial." 
 Now, I think this maybe isn't,a very useful way of thinking.,It's not just families either.,The medical professionals too,,you out there, you're in denial too.,You want to help. You want to fix.,You want to do.,You've succeeded in everything you've done,,and having a patient die,,well, that must feel like failure. 
 I saw it firsthand.,Just days before Terence died,,his oncologist said,,"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.",Days before he died. 
 Yet Ira Byock,,the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth,said, "You know, the best doctor in the world,has never succeeded in making anyone immortal." 
 So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,",and I'd like to borrow a phrase,from my friends in software design.,You just redefine denial and hope,,and it becomes a feature of being human.,It's not a bug.,It's a feature. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we need to think more constructively,about this very common, very profound,and very powerful human emotion.,It's part of the human condition,,and yet our system and our thinking,isn't built to accommodate it. 
 So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,,and I believed it.,Maybe I wanted to believe it.,And during Terence's illness, I, we,,we wanted to believe the story,of our fight together too.,Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,,it felt like giving up --,meant giving up not only his life,but also our story,,our story of us as fighters,,the story of us as invincible,,and for the doctors, the story of themselves,as healers. 
 So what do we need? 
 Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.,Maybe we need a new story,,not a story about giving up the fight,or of hopelessness,,but rather a story of victory and triumph,,of a valiant battle and, eventually,,a graceful retreat,,a story that acknowledges,that not even the greatest general defeats every foe,,that no doctor has ever succeeded,in making anyone immortal,,and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,,has ever stopped even the bravest,,wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband,from dying when it was his time to go. 
 People did mention hospice,,but I wouldn't listen.,Hospice was for people who were dying,,and Terence wasn't dying.,As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,,which I'm sure, as you all know,,is a pretty typical outcome,,and we never said goodbye,because we were unprepared for the end. 
 We have a noble path to curing the disease,,patients and doctors alike,,but there doesn't seem to be,a noble path to dying.,Dying is seen as failing,,and we had a heroic narrative,for fighting together,,but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go. 
 So maybe we need a narrative,for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,,and maybe our new story will be,about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.,Terence loved poetry,,and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy,is one of my favorite poets.,So I'll give you a couple lines from him.,This is a poem about Mark Antony.,You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,,Cleopatra's guy?,Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.,And he's been a pretty good general.,He's won all the fights,,he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,,and yet this time, finally,,he's come to the city of Alexandria,and realized he's lost.,The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.,They're singing.,And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.,And he suddenly knows,he's been deserted by the gods,,and it's time to let go.,And the poet tells him what to do.,He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,,a goodbye that's fit for a hero. 
 "As if long-prepared,,as if courageous,,as it becomes you,who were worthy of such a city,,approach the window with a firm step,,and with emotion,,but not with the entreaties,or the complaints of a coward,,as a last enjoyment,,listen to the sounds,,the exquisite instruments of the musical troops,,and bid her farewell,,the Alexandria you are losing." 
 That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,,a goodbye for a man,for whom anything,,well, almost anything,,was possible,,a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive. 
 And isn't that what we're missing?,How can we learn that people's decisions,about their loved ones,are often based strongly, powerfully,,many times irrationally,,on the slimmest of hopes?,The overwhelming presence of hope,isn't denial.,It's part of our DNA as humans,,and maybe it's time our healthcare system --,doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,,started accounting for the power of that hope.,Hope isn't a bug.,It's a feature. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Motor racing is a funny old business.,We make a new car every year,,and then we spend the rest of the season,trying to understandnwhat it is we've built,to make it better, to make it faster.,And then the next year, we start again.,Now, the car you see in frontnof you is quite complicated.,The chassis is madenup of about 11,000 components,,the engine another 6,000,,the electronicsnabout eight and a half thousand.,So there's about 25,000 thingsnthere that can go wrong.,So motor racing is very muchnabout attention to detail.,The other thing about Formulan1 in particular,is we're always changing the car.,We're always trying to make it faster.,So every two weeks, we will be making,about 5,000 new componentsnto fit to the car.,Five to 10 percent of the race car,will be differentnevery two weeks of the year.,So how do we do that?,Well, we start our lifenwith the racing car.,We have a lot of sensorsnon the car to measure things.,On the race car in front of you here,there are about 120 sensorsnwhen it goes into a race.,It's measuring all sortsnof things around the car.,That data is logged. We're logging about,500 different parametersnwithin the data systems,,about 13,000 health parameters and events,to say when things are notnworking the way they should do,,and we're sending that datanback to the garage,using telemetry at a ratenof two to four megabits per second.,So during a two-hour race,neach car will be sending,750 million numbers.,That's twice as many numbersnas words that each of us,speaks in a lifetime.,It's a huge amount of data.,But it's not enough justnto have data and measure it.,You need to be able to donsomething with it.,So we've spent a lot of time and effort,in turning the data into stories,to be able to tell,nwhat's the state of the engine,,how are the tires degrading,,what's the situationnwith fuel consumption?,So all of this is taking data,and turning it into knowledgenthat we can act upon.,Okay, so let's have a looknat a little bit of data.,Let's pick a bit of data from,another three-month-old patient.,This is a child, and what you'renseeing here is real data,,and on the far right-hand side,,where everything starts gettingna little bit catastrophic,,that is the patient goingninto cardiac arrest.,It was deemed to benan unpredictable event.,This was a heart attacknthat no one could see coming.,But when we look at the information there,,we can see that thingsnare starting to become,a little fuzzy about five minutesnor so before the cardiac arrest.,We can see small changes,in things like the heart rate moving.,These were all undetectednby normal thresholds,which would be applied to data.,So the question is, whyncouldn't we see it?,Was this a predictable event?,Can we look morenat the patterns in the data,to be able to do things better?,So this is a child,,about the same agenas the racing car on stage,,three months old.,It's a patient with a heart problem.,Now, when you look at some of the datanon the screen above,,things like heart rate, pulse,noxygen, respiration rates,,they're all unusual for a normal child,,but they're quite normalnfor the child there,,and so one of the challengesnyou have in health care is,,how can I look at the patientnin front of me,,have something which is specific for her,,and be able to detect whennthings start to change,,when things start to deteriorate?,Because like a racing car, any patient,,when things start to gonbad, you have a short time,to make a difference.,So what we did is we took a data system,which we run every two weeksnof the year in Formula 1,and we installed itnon the hospital computers,at Birmingham Children's Hospital.,We streamed datanfrom the bedside instruments,in their pediatric intensive care,so that we could both looknat the data in real time,and, more importantly, to store the data,so that we could start to learn from it.,And then, we applied an application on top,which would allow us to teasenout the patterns in the data,in real time so we couldnsee what was happening,,so we could determine whennthings started to change.,Now, in motor racing, we'renall a little bit ambitious,,audacious, a little bitnarrogant sometimes,,so we decided we would alsonlook at the children,as they were being transportednto intensive care.,Why should we waitnuntil they arrived in the hospital,before we started to look?,And so we installed a real-time link,between the ambulance and the hospital,,just using normal 3Gntelephony to send that data,so that the ambulance became an extra bed,in intensive care.,And then we started looking at the data.,So the wiggly linesnat the top, all the colors,,this is the normal sort of datanyou would see on a monitor --,heart rate, pulse,noxygen within the blood,,and respiration.,The lines on the bottom,nthe blue and the red,,these are the interesting ones.,The red line is showingnan automated version,of the early warning score,that Birmingham Children's Hospitalnwere already running.,They'd been running that since 2008,,and already have stopped cardiac arrests,and distress within the hospital.,The blue line is an indication,of when patterns start to change,,and immediately, before we even started,putting in clinical interpretation,,we can see that the datanis speaking to us.,It's telling us that somethingnis going wrong.,The plot with the red and the green blobs,,this is plotting different components,of the data against each other.,The green is us learningnwhat is normal for that child.,We call it the cloud of normality.,And when things start to change,,when conditions start to deteriorate,,we move into the red line.,There's no rocket science here.,It is displaying data that existsnalready in a different way,,to amplify it, to providencues to the doctors,,to the nurses, so they cannsee what's happening.,In the same way that a good racing driver,relies on cues to decidenwhen to apply the brakes,,when to turn into a corner,,we need to helpnour physicians and our nurses,to see when thingsnare starting to go wrong.,So we have a very ambitious program.,We think that the race is on to donsomething differently.,We are thinking big.nIt's the right thing to do.,We have an approach which,nif it's successful,,there's no reason why itnshould stay within a hospital.,It can go beyond the walls.,With wireless connectivity these days,,there is no reason whynpatients, doctors and nurses,always have to be in the same place,at the same time.,And meanwhile, we'll takenour little three-month-old baby,,keep taking it to the track,nkeeping it safe,,and making it faster and better.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Thank you very much. 
 I moved to America 12 years agonwith my wife Terry and our two kids.,Actually, truthfully, we movednto Los Angeles -- 
 (Laughter) 
 thinking we were movingnto America, but anyway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a short plane ridenfrom Los Angeles to America. 
 (Laughter) 
 I got here 12 years ago,,and when I got here,nI was told various things,,like, "Americans don't get irony." 
 (Laughter) 
 Have you come across this idea?,It's not true.,I've traveled the whole lengthnand breadth of this country.,I have found no evidencenthat Americans don't get irony.,It's one of those cultural myths,,like, "The British are reserved." 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know why people think this.,We've invaded every countrynwe've encountered. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's not true Americansndon't get irony,,but I just want you to knownthat that's what people,are saying about you behind your back.,You know, so when you leavenliving rooms in Europe,,people say, thankfully,nnobody was ironic in your presence. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I knew that Americans get irony,when I came across that legislation,n"No Child Left Behind." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because whoever thoughtnof that title gets irony. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't they? 
 (Applause) 
 Because it's leavingnmillions of children behind.,Now I can see that's not a very attractivenname for legislation:,"Millions of Children Left Behind.",I can see that.,What's the plan?,We propose to leavenmillions of children behind,,and here's how it's going to work. 
 And it's working beautifully. 
 (Laughter) 
 In some parts of the country,,60 percent of kids drop outnof high school.,In the Native American communities,,it's 80 percent of kids.,If we halved that number,,one estimate is it would createna net gain to the U.S. economy,over 10 years,nof nearly a trillion dollars.,From an economic point of view,,this is good math, isn't it,nthat we should do this?,It actually costs an enormous amount,to mop up the damagenfrom the dropout crisis. 
 But the dropout crisisnis just the tip of an iceberg.,What it doesn't countnare all the kids who are in school,but being disengagednfrom it, who don't enjoy it,,who don't get any real benefit from it. 
 And the reason is notnthat we're not spending enough money.,America spends more money on educationnthan most other countries.,Class sizes are smallernthan in many countries.,And there are hundredsnof initiatives every year,to try and improve education.,The trouble is, it's all goingnin the wrong direction.,There are three principlesnon which human life flourishes,,and they are contradictednby the culture of education,under which most teachers have to labor,and most students have to endure. 
 The first is this, that human beingsnare naturally different and diverse.,Can I ask you, how many of younhave got children of your own?,Okay. Or grandchildren.,How about two children or more? Right.,And the rest of younhave seen such children. 
 (Laughter) 
 Small people wandering about. 
 (Laughter) 
 I will make you a bet,,and I am confidentnthat I will win the bet.,If you've got two children or more,,I bet you they are completelyndifferent from each other.,Aren't they? 
 (Applause) 
 You would never confuse them, would you?,Like, "Which one are you? Remind me." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Your mother and I neednsome color-coding system,so we don't get confused." 
 Education under "No Child Left Behind",is based on not diversity but conformity.,What schools are encouragednto do is to find out,what kids can do acrossna very narrow spectrum of achievement.,One of the effectsnof "No Child Left Behind",has been to narrow the focusnonto the so-called STEM disciplines.,They're very important.,I'm not here to arguenagainst science and math.,On the contrary, they're necessarynbut they're not sufficient.,A real education has to give equal weight,to the arts, the humanities,nto physical education.,An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you -- 
 (Applause) 
 One estimate in America currentlynis that something like 10 percent of kids,,getting on that way,,are being diagnosednwith various conditions,under the broad titlenof attention deficit disorder.,ADHD.,I'm not saying there's no such thing.,I just don't believenit's an epidemic like this.,If you sit kids down, hour after hour,,doing low-grade clerical work,,don't be surprised if they startnto fidget, you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Children are not, for the most part,nsuffering from a psychological condition.,They're suffering from childhood. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I know this becausenI spent my early life as a child.,I went through the whole thing.,Kids prosper best with a broad curriculumnthat celebrates their various talents,,not just a small range of them.,And by the way, the artsnaren't just important,because they improve math scores.,They're important because they speaknto parts of children's being,which are otherwise untouched. 
 The second, thank you -- 
 (Applause) 
 The second principlenthat drives human life flourishing,is curiosity.,If you can light the sparknof curiosity in a child,,they will learn without any furthernassistance, very often.,Children are natural learners.,It's a real achievementnto put that particular ability out,,or to stifle it.,Curiosity is the engine of achievement.,Now the reason I say this,is because one of the effectsnof the current culture here,,if I can say so,,has been to de-professionalize teachers.,There is no system in the worldnor any school in the country,that is better than its teachers.,Teachers are the lifebloodnof the success of schools.,But teaching is a creative profession.,Teaching, properly conceived,nis not a delivery system.,You know, you're not there justnto pass on received information.,Great teachers do that,,but what great teachers also do is mentor,,stimulate, provoke, engage.,You see, in the end,neducation is about learning.,If there's no learning going on,nthere's no education going on.,And people can spend an awful lot of time,discussing educationnwithout ever discussing learning.,The whole point of educationnis to get people to learn. 
 An old friend of mine --nactually very old, he's dead. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid. 
 (Laughter) 
 But a wonderful guy he was,nwonderful philosopher.,He used to talk about the difference,between the tasknand achievement senses of verbs.,You can be engagednin the activity of something,,but not really benachieving it, like dieting. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a very good example.,There he is. He's dieting.,Is he losing any weight? Not really. 
 (Laughter) 
 Teaching is a word like that.,You can say, "There's Deborah,nshe's in room 34, she's teaching.",But if nobody's learning anything,,she may be engaged in the task of teachingnbut not actually fulfilling it. 
 The role of a teachernis to facilitate learning.,That's it.,And part of the problem is, I think,,that the dominant culturenof education has come to focus,on not teaching and learning, but testing.,Now, testing is important.,Standardized tests have a place.,But they should not benthe dominant culture of education.,They should be diagnostic.nThey should help. 
 (Applause) 
 If I go for a medical examination,nI want some standardized tests.,I do.,I want to knownwhat my cholesterol level is,compared to everybody else'snon a standard scale.,I don't want to be told on some scalenmy doctor invented in the car. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Your cholesterolnis what I call Level Orange." 
 "Really?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Is that good?" "We don't know." 
 (Laughter) 
 But all that should support learning.,It shouldn't obstruct it,nwhich of course it often does.,So in place of curiosity,nwhat we have is a culture of compliance.,Our children and teachers are encouragednto follow routine algorithms,rather than to excite that powernof imagination and curiosity.,And the third principle is this:nthat human life is inherently creative.,It's why we all have different résumés.,We create our lives,,and we can recreate themnas we go through them.,It's the common currencynof being a human being.,It's why human culturenis so interesting and diverse and dynamic.,I mean, other animals may well havenimaginations and creativity,,but it's not so muchnin evidence, is it, as ours?,I mean, you may have a dog.,And your dog may get depressed.,You know, but it doesn't listennto Radiohead, does it? 
 (Laughter) 
 And sit staring out the windownwith a bottle of Jack Daniels. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Would you like to come for a walk?","No, I'm fine." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You go. I'll wait. But take pictures." 
 (Laughter) 
 We all create our own livesnthrough this restless process,of imagining alternativesnand possibilities,,and one of the roles of education,is to awaken and developnthese powers of creativity.,Instead, what we havenis a culture of standardization. 
 Now, it doesn't have to be that way.,It really doesn't.,Finland regularly comes out on topnin math, science and reading.,Now, we only knownthat's what they do well at,,because that's all that's being tested.,That's one of the problems of the test.,They don't look for other thingsnthat matter just as much.,The thing about work in Finland is this:,they don't obsess about those disciplines.,They have a very broadnapproach to education,,which includes humanities,nphysical education, the arts. 
 Second, there is no standardizedntesting in Finland.,I mean, there's a bit,,but it's not what getsnpeople up in the morning,,what keeps them at their desks. 
 The third thing --nand I was at a meeting recently,with some people from Finland,nactual Finnish people,,and somebody from the American systemnwas saying to the people in Finland,,"What do you donabout the drop-out rate in Finland?" 
 And they all looked a bitnbemused, and said,,"Well, we don't have one.,Why would you drop out?,If people are in trouble,nwe get to them quite quickly,and we help and support them." 
 Now people always say,,"Well, you know, you can't comparenFinland to America.",No. I think there's a populationnof around five million in Finland.,But you can compare itnto a state in America.,Many states in Americanhave fewer people in them than that.,I mean, I've beennto some states in America,and I was the only person there. 
 (Laughter) 
 Really. Really.,I was asked to lock up when I left. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what all the high-performingnsystems in the world do,is currently what is not evident, sadly,,across the systems in America --,I mean, as a whole.,One is this:,they individualize teaching and learning.,They recognize that it's studentsnwho are learning,and the system has to engage them,,their curiosity, their individuality,nand their creativity.,That's how you get them to learn. 
 The second is that they attributena very high status,to the teaching profession.,They recognizenthat you can't improve education,if you don't pick great people to teachnand keep giving them,constant supportnand professional development.,Investing in professionalndevelopment is not a cost.,It's an investment,,and every other countrynthat's succeeding well knows that,,whether it's Australia, Canada,,South Korea, Singapore,nHong Kong or Shanghai.,They know that to be the case. 
 And the third is,,they devolve responsibilitynto the school level,for getting the job done.,You see, there's a big difference here,between going into a mode of commandnand control in education --,That's what happens in some systems.,Central or state governments decide,,they know best and they're goingnto tell you what to do.,The trouble is that educationndoesn't go on,in the committee roomsnof our legislative buildings.,It happens in classrooms and schools,,and the people who do itnare the teachers and the students,,and if you remove their discretion,nit stops working.,You have to put it back to the people. 
 (Applause) 
 There is wonderful worknhappening in this country.,But I have to say it's happening,in spite of the dominantnculture of education,,not because of it.,It's like people are sailingninto a headwind all the time.,And the reason I think is this:,that many of the current policies,are based on mechanisticnconceptions of education.,It's like educationnis an industrial process,that can be improvednjust by having better data,,and somewhere in the back of the mindnof some policy makers,is this idea that if we fine-tune itnwell enough, if we just get it right,,it will all hum along perfectlyninto the future.,It won't, and it never did. 
 The point is that educationnis not a mechanical system.,It's a human system.,It's about people,,people who either do wantnto learn or don't want to learn.,Every student who dropsnout of school has a reason for it,which is rooted in their own biography.,They may find it boring.,They may find it irrelevant.,They may find that it's at odds withnthe life they're living outside of school.,There are trends,nbut the stories are always unique.,I was at a meeting recentlynin Los Angeles of --,they're called alternativeneducation programs.,These are programs designednto get kids back into education.,They have certain common features.,They're very personalized.,They have strong support for the teachers,,close links with the communitynand a broad and diverse curriculum,,and often programs which involve studentsnoutside school as well as inside school.,And they work.,What's interesting to me is,nthese are called "alternative education." 
 (Laughter) 
 You know?,And all the evidencenfrom around the world is,,if we all did that, there'd benno need for the alternative. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 So I think we have to embracena different metaphor.,We have to recognizenthat it's a human system,,and there are conditionsnunder which people thrive,,and conditions under which they don't.,We are after all organic creatures,,and the culture of the schoolnis absolutely essential.,Culture is an organic term, isn't it? 
 Not far from where I livenis a place called Death Valley.,Death Valley is the hottest,ndriest place in America,,and nothing grows there.,Nothing grows therenbecause it doesn't rain.,Hence, Death Valley.,In the winter of 2004,nit rained in Death Valley.,Seven inches of rain fellnover a very short period.,And in the spring of 2005,nthere was a phenomenon.,The whole floor of Death Valleynwas carpeted in flowers for a while.,What it proved is this:,that Death Valley isn't dead.,It's dormant.,Right beneath the surfacenare these seeds of possibility,waiting for the right conditionsnto come about,,and with organic systems,nif the conditions are right,,life is inevitable.,It happens all the time.,You take an area, a school, a district,,you change the conditions, give peoplena different sense of possibility,,a different set of expectations,na broader range of opportunities,,you cherish and value the relationshipsnbetween teachers and learners,,you offer peoplenthe discretion to be creative,and to innovate in what they do,,and schools that were oncenbereft spring to life. 
 Great leaders know that.,The real role of leadershipnin education --,and I think it's truenat the national level,,the state level, at the school level --,is not and should not bencommand and control.,The real role of leadershipnis climate control,,creating a climate of possibility.,And if you do that, people will rise to it,and achieve thingsnthat you completely did not anticipate,and couldn't have expected. 
 There's a wonderful quotenfrom Benjamin Franklin.,"There are three sortsnof people in the world:,Those who are immovable,,people who don't get it,,or don't want to do anything about it;,there are people who are movable,,people who see the need for change,and are prepared to listen to it;,and there are people who move,,people who make things happen.",And if we can encourage more people,nthat will be a movement.,And if the movement is strong enough,,that's, in the best sensenof the word, a revolution.,And that's what we need. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)"Even in purely non-religious terms,,homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.,It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality --,a pitiable flight from life.,As such, it deserves no compassion,,it deserves no treatment,as minority martyrdom,,and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness." 
 That's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.,And last year, the president of the United States,came out in favor of gay marriage. 
 (Applause) 
 And my question is, how did we get from there to here?,How did an illness become an identity? 
 When I was perhaps six years old,,I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.,And at the end of buying our shoes,,the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.,My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.,My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.,But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.,And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.,The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay --,(Laughter) --,is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 When I was little, my mother used to say,,"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.,And until you have children, you don't know what it's like.",And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world,that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.,And when I was an adolescent, I thought,that I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.,And when she said it, it made me anxious.,And after I came out of the closet,,when she continued to say it, it made me furious.,I said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.,And I want you to stop saying that." 
 About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine,to write a piece about deaf culture.,And I was rather taken aback.,I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.,Those poor people, they couldn't hear.,They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?,And then I went out into the deaf world.,I went to deaf clubs.,I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.,I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee,where people complained about that slurry Southern signing. 
 (Laughter) 
 And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,,I become convinced that deafness was a culture,and that the people in the deaf world who said,,"We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,",were saying something that was viable.,It wasn't my culture,,and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,,but I appreciated that it was a culture,and that for the people who were members of it,,it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.,It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture. 
 Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.,And when her daughter was born,,she suddenly found herself confronting questions,that now began to seem quite resonant to me.,She was facing the question of what to do with this child.,Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?",Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,,get involved in the Little People of America,,become aware of what was happening for dwarfs? 
 And I suddenly thought,,most deaf children are born to hearing parents.,Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.,Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.,Most gay people are born to straight parents.,Those straight parents often want them to function,in what they think of as the mainstream world,,and those gay people have to discover identity later on.,And here was this friend of mine,looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.,And I thought, there it is again:,A family that perceives itself to be normal,with a child who seems to be extraordinary.,And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity. 
 There are vertical identities,,which are passed down generationally from parent to child.,Those are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.,Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.,And while some of them can be difficult,,there's no attempt to cure them.,You can argue that it's harder in the United States --,our current presidency notwithstanding --,to be a person of color.,And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure,that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians,come out with creamy skin and yellow hair. 
 There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.,And I call them horizontal identities,,because the peer group is the horizontal experience.,These are identities that are alien to your parents,and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.,And those identities, those horizontal identities,,people have almost always tried to cure. 
 And I wanted to look at what the process is,through which people who have those identities,come to a good relationship with them.,And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance,that needed to take place.,There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.,And they don't always coincide. 
 And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry,because they feel as though their parents don't love them,,when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.,Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally,throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.,But acceptance is something that takes time.,It always takes time. 
 One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.,When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,,a very disabling condition,,and his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,,he would have no intellectual capacity,,and he would probably not even recognize them.,And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital,so that he could die there quietly. 
 And his mother said she wasn't going to do it.,And she took her son home.,And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,,she found the best doctor in the country,for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,,and she got Clinton enrolled with him.,And in the course of his childhood,,he had 30 major surgical procedures.,And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital,while he was having those procedures,,as a result of which he now can walk. 
 And while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.,And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.,And he ended up achieving at a level,that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.,He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,,where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car,that accommodated his unusual body. 
 And his mother told me this story of coming home one day --,and he went to college nearby --,and she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,,in the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter),"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.,Two beers for them is four beers for him.",She said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,,but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone.",She said, "And then I thought,,if someone had said to me when he was born,that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- " 
 (Applause) 
 And I said to her, "What do you think you did,that helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?",And she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.,Clinton just always had that light in him.,And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there." 
 I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.,This one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America --,written by an important bioethicist.,He said, "There is no reason to feel guilty,about putting a Down syndrome child away,,whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium,or in a more responsible, lethal sense.,It is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.,True guilt arises only from an offense against a person,,and a Down's is not a person." 
 There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made,in the treatment of gay people.,The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.,But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,,how we used to see people who were disabled,,how inhuman we held people to be.,And the change that's been accomplished there,,which is almost equally radical,,is one that we pay not very much attention to. 
 One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,,were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,,their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.,They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,,and so they decided they would build a little center --,two classrooms that they started with a few other parents --,to educate kids with D.S.,And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,,where there are now thousands upon thousands,of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught. 
 In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,,the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.,The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,,those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood. 
 The Robards had a lot to do with that.,And I said, "Do you regret it?,Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?,Do you wish you'd never heard of it?",And interestingly his father said,,"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,,because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,,and I'd like to give David an easier life.,But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss." 
 And Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.,For David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.,But speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born,that I could come to such a point --,speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder,and so much more purposeful in my whole life,,that speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world." 
 We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions,is on the up and up.,And yet we also live at the moment,when our ability to eliminate those conditions,has reached a height we never imagined before.,Most deaf infants born in the United States now,will receive Cochlear implants,,which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,,and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.,A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,,is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.,Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,,and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,,grow to full size.,Testing in humans is around the corner.,There are blood tests which are making progress,that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,,making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,,or to terminate them. 
 And so we have both social progress and medical progress.,And I believe in both of them.,I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,,and I think the same thing about the medical progress.,But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.,And when I see the way they're intersecting,in conditions like the three I've just described,,I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera,when the hero realizes he loves the heroine,at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan. 
 (Laughter) 
 We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.,And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,,what do we validate in our children,,and what do we cure in them? 
 Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,,"When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,',what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist,and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.',Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.,This is what we hear when you pray for a cure --,that your fondest wish for us,is that someday we will cease to be,and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.",It's a very extreme point of view,,but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have,and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.,They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be. 
 One of the families I interviewed for this project,was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.,It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,,and once they agreed, they were so full of their story,that they couldn't stop telling it.,And the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many --,I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation. 
 And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.,We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.,And I said, "If Dylan were here now,,do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?",And his father said, "I sure do.,I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.",And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.,And then she looked back up and said,,"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother,and never knowing what was going on inside his head." 
 When I had dinner with her a couple of years later --,one of many dinners that we had together --,she said, "You know, when it first happened,,I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.,If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,,this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.,But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much,that I don't want to imagine a life without them.,I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,,but the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.,"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world,if Dylan had never been born,,I've decided that it would not have been better for me." 
 I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,,problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,,and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.,And then I thought, all of us who have children,love the children we have, with their flaws.,If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling,and offered to take away the children I have,and give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --,I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.,And ultimately I feel,that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno,to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,,so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences,reflect on the universal experience of parenting,,which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,,where did you come from? 
 (Laughter) 
 It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --,there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,,there are only so many families of children who are transgender,,there are only so many families of prodigies --,who also face similar challenges in many ways --,there are only so many families in each of those categories --,but if you start to think,that the experience of negotiating difference within your family,is what people are addressing,,then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.,Ironically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,,that unite us. 
 I decided to have children while I was working on this project.,And many people were astonished and said,,"But how can you decide to have children,in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?",And I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.,What I'm studying is how much love there can be,,even when everything appears to be going wrong." 
 I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,,a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.,And when his ashes were interred, his mother said,,"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,,once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved.",And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child,if they had the effective will to do so. 
 So my husband is the biological father of two children,with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.,I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.,And so she and I have a daughter,,and mother and daughter live in Texas.,And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time,of whom I am the biological father,,and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,,the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis. 
 (Applause) 
 So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states. 
 And there are people who think that the existence of my family,somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.,And there are people who think that families like mine,shouldn't be allowed to exist.,And I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.,And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity,to ensure that the planet can go on,,so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family,in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness. 
 The day after our son was born,,the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.,He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.,She said that might mean that he had brain damage.,In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,,which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.,And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus. 
 And as she told me all of these things,,I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.,And I thought, here I had been working for years,on a book about how much meaning people had found,in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,,and I didn't want to join their number.,Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.,And like all parents since the dawn of time,,I wanted to protect my child from illness.,And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.,And yet, I knew from the work I had done,that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,,that those would ultimately be his identity,,and if they were his identity they would become my identity,,that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded. 
 We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,,we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.,We felt helpless.,And at the end of five hours,,they said that his brain was completely clear,and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.,And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,,she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I thought how my mother was right.,I thought, the love you have for your children,is unlike any other feeling in the world,,and until you have children, you don't know what it feels like. 
 I think children had ensnared me,the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.,But I'm not sure I would have noticed that,if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.,I'd encountered so much strange love,,and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.,And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities. 
 During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned,the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,,and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.,And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,,enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children,and trying to breed identity out of misery,,I realized that day that my research had built me a plank,and that I was ready to join them on their ship. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hey guys.,It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,,because that was, like, I loved it,,and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill,and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden.",And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter),And it worked really well there.,And you know, it had a profound effect on me.,It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,,the way the world works can be changed,,and it can be changed by me in these small ways.,And my relationship to,especially human-made objects,which someone else said they work like this,,well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit. 
 And so, about 20 years later,,I didn't realize the full effect of this,,but I went to Costa Rica,and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,,and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,,and they could make beds out of trees,,and they could -- I watched this woman for three days.,I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,,these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together,and make little thicker threads, like strings,,and she would weave the strings together,,and as the materiality of this exact very bag,formed before my eyes over those three days,,the materiality of the way the world works,,of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,,because I realized that this bag and these clothes,and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,,everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock,or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,,maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way. 
 And so I had to start studying,,who is it that's making these decisions?,Who's making these things? How did they make them?,What stops us from making them?,Because this is how reality is created.,So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,,and I was studying the maker movement,and makers and creativity.,And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís,doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers. 
 So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,,where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out,and willing to try anything.,So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream,and just put stuff together, you know, make something,,I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.,We won't bring anything with us.,And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults,and teens to do.,Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,,and the shape of an oak leaf being made,by other small oak leaves being put together.,A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.,The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom,being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.,And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects,like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade,and put in a circle like a wreath. 
 And the creator of this, he said,,"This is fire. I call this fire." 
 And someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks,to stay on that tree?" 
 And he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you." 
 And I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.,He doesn't know, but he can show you.",So his hands know and his intuition knows,,but sometimes what we know gets in the way,of what could be, especially,when it comes to the human-made, human-built world.,We think we already know how something works,,so we can't imagine how it could work.,We know how it's supposed to work,,so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible. 
 So kids don't have as hard of a time with this,,and I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.,I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,,"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.,I'm going to give you some building blocks,and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,,so it's totally legit.",But he doesn't really know what to do with these.,I didn't show him.,And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this.",This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.,Just going to try to put them in shapes,and push on them and stuff.,And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism,where you can almost launch and catapult objects around,,and he enlists us in helping him. 
 And at this point, I'm starting to wonder,,what kind of tools can we give people,,especially adults, who know too much,,so that they can see the world as malleable,,so they see themselves as agents of change,in their everyday lives.,Because the most advanced scientists are really,just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,,pushing what matter can do,,the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,,and any sufficiently complicated task,,whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child --,anything that's complicated --,comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,,and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,,"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.,I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.,I'm going to use them a different way." 
 So let me show you a little demo.,This is a little piano circuit right in here,,and this is an ordinary paintbrush,that I smashed it together with. (Beeping),And so, with some ketchup,,— (musical notes) —,and then I can kind of,— (musical notes) —,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 And that's awesome, right?,But this is not what's awesome.,What's awesome is what happens,when you give the piano circuit to people.,A pencil is not just a pencil.,Look what it has in the middle of it.,That's a wire running down the middle,,and not only is it a wire,,if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack,into the middle of a pencil,,and you can lay out wire on the page, too,,and get electrical current to run through it.,And so you can kind of hack a pencil,,just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. 
 And the electricity runs through your body too.,And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.,You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.,All you do is connect to the bristles,,and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,,and the person's body conducts,,and leather is great to paint on,,and then you can start hooking to everything,,even the kitchen sink.,The metal in the sink is conductive.,Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin. 
 (Musical notes) 
 And you can even hook to the trees.,Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,,and you can use those together. 
 So — (Laughter) —,I took this to those same teens, because those teens are,really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.,I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.,And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,,and as the hula hoop traveled around her body,,she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.,You can see her pointing to it in the picture.,And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,,it would connect two little pieces of copper tape,,and it would make a sound, and the next sound,,and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. 
 I ran these workshops everywhere.,In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl,made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan,and some electrical tape and hot glue.,And professional designers were making artifacts,with this thing strapped onto it.,And big companies like Intel,or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,,were inviting me to give workshops,,just to practice this idea of smashing electronics,and everyday objects together.,And then we came up with this idea,to not just use electronics,,but let's just smash computers with everyday objects,and see how that goes over. 
 And so I just want to do a quick demo.,So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,,and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.,So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.,And I'll just hook up the forward arrow.,You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.,And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.,And now, if I touch this piece of pizza,,the slides that I showed you before should go forward.,And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it,to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,,now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,,so I should be able to go forwards and backwards,and forwards and backwards. Awesome. 
 And so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this.",Because no one really believed that this was important,or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy. 
 So we made a video to prove that,there's lots of stuff you can do.,You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh,and just Google for game controllers.,Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.,And you can literally draw joysticks,and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises),And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?,Well, if you take those out, they hold water great,,but you can totally cut your toes,,so yeah, just be careful. 
 You know the Happiness Project, where the experts,are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?,Well, I think it's cool,,but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.,It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.,We should all be participating,in changing the way the world works together. 
 Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.,Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.,Hover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,,and you've got a little cat photo booth. 
 And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.,If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.,And so we put it up on Kickstarter,,and hundreds of people bought it in the first day.,And then 30 days later,,11,000 people had backed the project. 
 And then what the best part is, we started getting,a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.,So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,,including drinking Listerine.,And we actually sent this guy materials.,We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.,You're, like, a pro maker." 
 Okay, just wait for this one. This is good. 
 (Laughter),(Applause) 
 And these guys at the exploratorium are,playing house plants as if they were drums.,And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways. 
 And then this brother -- look at this diagram.,See where it says "sister"?,I love when people put humans on the diagram.,I always add humans to any technical --,if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.,And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister,so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,,jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.,And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano. 
 And this is fun,,and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?,But it's also very serious because,all this accessibility stuff started coming up,,where people can't use computers, necessarily.,Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy,and he can't use a normal keyboard.,And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford,to buy all these custom controllers.,And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make,these gloves to allow him to navigate the web.,And a huge eruption of discussion,around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.,We didn't plan for that at all. 
 And then all these professional musicians started using it,,like at Coachella, just this weekend,Jurassic 5 was using this onstage,,and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,,and he put this up last month.,And I love the carrot on the turntable. 
 (Music: Massive Attack — "Teardrop") 
 Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter) 
 And when this started to get serious,,I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,,because otherwise people are going to be getting this,and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,,and governments will be crumbling,,and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.,And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid,of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit." 
 And as you start to mess around this way,,I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see,the landscape of your everyday life,a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,,and a little bit more like you could participate,in designing the future of the way the world works. 
 And so next time you're on an escalator,and you drop an M&M by accident,,you know, maybe that's an M&M surfboard, not an escalator,,so don't pick it up right away.,Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets,and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever. 
 I used to want to design a utopian society,or a perfect world or something like that.,But as I'm kind of getting older,and kind of messing with all this stuff,,I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world,really can't be designed by one person,or even by a million experts.,It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,,each following their own passions,,and each kind of like a mosaic coming up,and creating this world in their backyards,and in their kitchens.,And that's the world I really want to live in. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi. I am an architect.,I am the only architect in the world,making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,,and this exhibition is the first one I did,using paper tubes.,1986, much, much longer before people started talking,about ecological issues and environmental issues,,I just started testing the paper tube,in order to use this as a building structure.,It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,,but this is much stronger than I expected,,and also it's very easy to waterproof,,and also, because it's industrial material,,it's also possible to fireproof. 
 Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.,This is the first temporary building made out of paper.,There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],,there are only 12 tubes with a diameter,of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.,As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.,In case you're finished with toilet paper,,you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter),So it's very useful. 
 Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.,I was asked to design the building,,because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.,So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,,recyclable paper.,My goal of the design is not when it's completed.,My goal was when the building was demolished,,because each country makes a lot of pavilions,but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,,so my building has to be reused or recycled.,After, the building was recycled.,So that was the goal of my design. 
 Then I was very lucky to win the competition,to build the second Pompidou Center in France,in the city of Metz.,Because I was so poor,,I wanted to rent an office in Paris,,but I couldn't afford it,,so I decided to bring my students to Paris,to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris,by ourselves.,So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints,to complete the 35-meter-long office.,We stayed there for six years without paying any rent. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Thank you. I had one big problem.,Because we were part of the exhibition,,even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.,That was the problem. 
 Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.,It's a very popular museum now,,and I created a big monument for the government. 
 But then I was very disappointed,at my profession as an architect,,because we are not helping, we are not working for society,,but we are working for privileged people,,rich people, government, developers.,They have money and power.,Those are invisible.,So they hire us to visualize their power and money,by making monumental architecture.,That is our profession, even historically it's the same,,even now we are doing the same.,So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,,even though there are so many people,who lost their houses by natural disasters.,But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.,For example, earthquakes never kill people,,but collapse of the buildings kill people.,That's the responsibility of architects.,Then people need some temporary housing,,but there are no architects working there,because we are too busy working for privileged people.,So I thought, even as architects,,we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.,We can make it better.,So that is why I started working in disaster areas. 
 1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.,Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.,Over two million people became refugees.,But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp,organized by the U.N.,They're so poor, and they are freezing,with blankets during the rainy season,,In the shelters built by the U.N.,,they were just providing a plastic sheet,,and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.,But over two million people cut trees.,It just became big, heavy deforestation,and an environmental problem.,That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.,Very expensive, they throw them out for money,,then cutting trees again.,So I proposed my idea to improve the situation,using these recycled paper tubes,because this is so cheap and also so strong,,but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.,We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test,for the durability and moisture and termites, so on. 
 And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,,we had a big earthquake.,Nearly 7,000 people were killed,,and the city like this Nagata district,,all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.,And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees,suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --,all the building was totally destroyed. 
 So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,,"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?" 
 And he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?,After a fire, what are you proposing?" 
 So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.,I started commuting to Kobe,,and I met the society of Vietnamese people.,They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets,in the park.,So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.,I made a paper tube shelter for them,,and in order to make it easy to be built by students,and also easy to demolish,,I used beer crates as a foundation.,I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,,because at that time, the Asahi beer company,made their plastic beer crates red,,which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.,The color coordination is very important.,And also I still remember, we were expecting,to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,,but it came empty. (Laughter),So I remember it was so disappointing.,So during the summer with my students,,we built over 50 units of the shelters. 
 Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.,He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,,bring your students to build, you can do it." 
 So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.,It was meant to stay there for three years,,but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.,Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,,and we proposed to donate this church,,so we dismantled them,,we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.,It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.,So this building became a permanent building. 
 Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?,Even a building made in paper,can be permanent as long as people love it.,Even a concrete building can be very temporary,if that is made to make money. 
 In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,,I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.,2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.,In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake,and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages. 
 And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,,nearly 70,000 people were killed,,and also especially many of the schools were destroyed,because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.,I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.,I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.,In one month, we completed nine classrooms,,over 500 square meters.,It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China. 
 In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.,And this is a very interesting photo:,former Prime Minister Berlusconi,and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --,you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.,And they are very kind, affording my model.,I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,,because L'Aquila is very famous for music,and all the concert halls were destroyed,,so musicians were moving out. 
 So I proposed to the mayor,,I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.,He said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it.",And I was very lucky.,Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,,and our former prime minister came,,so they helped us to collect money,,and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government,to rebuild this temporary auditorium. 
 Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,,but it's impossible to fly over,,so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,,to drive six hours to get to Haiti,with the local students in Santo Domingo,to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes. 
 This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.,After the earthquake and tsunami,,people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.,But look at this. There's no privacy.,People suffer mentally and physically.,So we went there to build partitions,with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,,just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.,However, some of the facility authority,doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,,simply, it's become more difficult to control them.,But it's really necessary to do it. 
 They don't have enough flat area to build,standard government single-story housing like this one.,Look at this. Even civil government is doing,such poor construction of the temporary housing,,so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,,so I thought, we have to make multi-story building,because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable. 
 So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.,Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village,in Miyagi.,He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].,I used the shipping container,and also the students helped us to make,all the building furniture,to make them comfortable,,within the budget of the government,but also the area of the house is exactly the same,,but much more comfortable.,Many of the people want to stay here forever.,I was very happy to hear that. 
 Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.,About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,,also they had a big earthquake,,and many Japanese students were also killed,,and the most important cathedral of the city,,the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.,And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral. 
 So this is under construction.,And I'd like to keep building monuments,that are beloved by people. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)So last year, on the Fourth of July,,experiments at the Large Hadron Collider,discovered the Higgs boson.,It was a historical day.,There's no doubt that from now on,,the Fourth of July will be remembered,not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,,but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.,Well, at least, here at CERN. 
 But for me, the biggest surprise of that day,was that there was no big surprise.,In the eye of a theoretical physicist,,the Higgs boson is a clever explanation,of how some elementary particles gain mass,,but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory,and incomplete solution.,Too many questions are left unanswered.,The Higgs boson does not share the beauty,,the symmetry, the elegance,,of the rest of the elementary particle world.,For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists,believe that the Higgs boson could not,be the full story.,We were expecting new particles and new phenomena,accompanying the Higgs boson.,Instead, so far, the measurements,coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles,or unexpected phenomena. 
 Of course, the verdict is not definitive.,In 2015, the LHC will almost double,the energy of the colliding protons,,and these more powerful collisions,will allow us to explore further the particle world,,and we will certainly learn much more. 
 But for the moment, since we have found,no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose,that the particles that we know today,,including the Higgs boson,,are the only elementary particles in nature,,even at energies much larger,than what we have explored so far.,Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.,We will find a surprising and intriguing result,about our universe, and to explain my point,,let me first tell you what the Higgs is about,,and to do so, we have to go back,to one tenth of a billionth of a second,after the Big Bang.,And according to the Higgs theory,,at that instant, a dramatic event took place,in the universe.,Space-time underwent a phase transition.,It was something very similar to the phase transition,that occurs when water turns into ice,below zero degrees.,But in our case, the phase transition,is not a change in the way the molecules,are arranged inside the material,,but is about a change,of the very fabric of space-time. 
 During this phase transition, empty space,became filled with a substance,that we now call Higgs field.,And this substance may seem invisible to us,,but it has a physical reality.,It surrounds us all the time,,just like the air we breathe in this room.,And some elementary particles interact,with this substance, gaining energy in the process.,And this intrinsic energy is what we call,the mass of a particle,,and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC,has conclusively proved that this substance is real,,because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.,And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story. 
 But this story is far more interesting than that.,By studying the Higgs theory,,theoretical physicists discovered,,not through an experiment,but with the power of mathematics,,that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist,only in the form that we observe today.,Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid,,so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,,could exist in two states.,Besides the known Higgs state,,there could be a second state in which the Higgs field,is billions and billions times denser,than what we observe today,,and the mere existence of another state,of the Higgs field poses a potential problem.,This is because, according to the laws,of quantum mechanics, it is possible,to have transitions between two states,,even in the presence of an energy barrier,separating the two states,,and the phenomenon is called,,quite appropriately, quantum tunneling.,Because of quantum tunneling,,I could disappear from this room,and reappear in the next room,,practically penetrating the wall.,But don't expect me to actually perform the trick,in front of your eyes, because the probability,for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.,You would have to wait a really long time,before it happens, but believe me,,quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,,and it has been observed in many systems.,For instance, the tunnel diode,,a component used in electronics,,works thanks to the wonders,of quantum tunneling. 
 But let's go back to the Higgs field.,If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,,then, because of quantum tunneling,,a bubble of this state could suddenly appear,in a certain place of the universe at a certain time,,and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.,Bubbles of vapor form inside the water,,then they expand, turning liquid into gas.,In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state,could come into existence because of quantum tunneling.,The bubble would then expand at the speed of light,,invading all space, and turning the Higgs field,from the familiar state into a new state. 
 Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.,We may not realize it in ordinary life,,but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical,for the structure of matter.,If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,,we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying,inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,,and hydrogen would be,the only possible chemical element in the universe.,And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,,is not just a few times more intense than today,,but billions of times,,and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,,all atomic matter would collapse.,No molecular structures would be possible, no life. 
 So, I wonder, is it possible,that in the future, the Higgs field,will undergo a phase transition and,,through quantum tunneling, will be transformed,into this nasty, ultra-dense state?,In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate,of the Higgs field in our universe?,And the crucial ingredient necessary,to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.,And experiments at the LHC found that the mass,of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.,This is tiny when expressed in familiar units,,because it's equal to something like,10 to the minus 22 grams,,but it is large in particle physics units,,because it is equal to the weight,of an entire molecule,of a DNA constituent. 
 So armed with this information from the LHC,,together with some colleagues here at CERN,,we computed the probability,that our universe could quantum tunnel,into the ultra-dense Higgs state,,and we found a very intriguing result.,Our calculations showed,that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass,is very special.,It has just the right value,to keep the universe hanging,in an unstable situation.,The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration,that has lasted so far,but that will eventually collapse.,So according to these calculations,,we are like campers,who accidentally set their tent,at the edge of a cliff.,And eventually, the Higgs field,will undergo a phase transition,and matter will collapse into itself. 
 So is this how humanity is going to disappear?,I don't think so.,Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling,of the Higgs field is not likely to occur,in the next 10 to the 100 years,,and this is a very long time.,It's even longer than,the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government. 
 (Laughter) 
 Even so, we will be long gone by then.,In about five billion years,,our sun will become a red giant,,as large as the Earth's orbit,,and our Earth will be kaput,,and in a thousand billion years,,if dark energy keeps on fueling,space expansion at the present rate,,you will not even be able to see as far as your toes,,because everything around you,expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.,So it is really unlikely,that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse. 
 But the reason why I am interested,in the transition of the Higgs field,is because I want to address the question,,why is the Higgs boson mass so special?,Why is it just right to keep the universe,at the edge of a phase transition?,Theoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.,More than how a phenomenon works,,theoretical physicists are always interested in,why a phenomenon works in the way it works.,We think that this these "why" questions,can give us clues,about the fundamental principles of nature.,And indeed, a possible answer to my question,opens up new universes, literally.,It has been speculated that our universe,is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse,made out of a multitude of bubbles,,and each bubble is a different universe,with different fundamental constants,and different physical laws.,And in this context, you can only talk about,the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.,Then the key to the mystery,could lie in the statistical properties,of the multiverse.,It would be something like what happens,with sand dunes on a beach.,In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes,of any slope angle in a beach,,and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes,are typically around 30, 35 degrees.,And the reason is simple:,because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.,As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes,have slope angles around the critical value,,near to collapse.,And something similar could happen,for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.,In the majority of bubble universes,,the Higgs mass could be around the critical value,,near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,,because of two competing effects,,just as in the case of sand. 
 My story does not have an end,,because we still don't know the end of the story.,This is science in progress,,and to solve the mystery, we need more data,,and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues,to this story.,Just one number, the Higgs boson mass,,and yet, out of this number we learn so much.,I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles,are all there is in the universe,,even beyond the domain explored so far.,From this, we discovered that the Higgs field,that permeates space-time may be standing,on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,,and we discovered that this may be a hint,that our universe is only a grain of sand,in a giant beach, the multiverse. 
 But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.,That's how physics works: A single measurement,can put us on the road to a new understanding,of the universe,or it can send us down a blind alley.,But whichever it turns out to be,,there is one thing I'm sure of:,The journey will be full of surprises. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The idea of eliminating povertynis a great goal.,I don't think anyonenin this room would disagree.,What worries menis when politicians with money,and charismatic rock stars -- 
 (Laughter) 
 use the words,," ... it all just sounds so, so simple." 
 Now, I've got no bucket of money today,and I've got no policy to release,,and I certainly haven't got a guitar.,I'll leave that to others.,But I do have an idea,,and that idea is callednHousing for Health. 
 Housing for Health works with poor people.,It works in the places where they live,,and the work is donento improve their health.,Over the last 28 years,,this tough, grinding, dirty work,has been done by literallynthousands of people around Australia,and, more recently, overseas,,and their work has proven,that focused design can improveneven the poorest living environments.,It can improve health,and it can play a part in reducing,nif not eliminating, poverty. 
 I'm going to startnwhere the story began --,1985, in Central Australia.,A man called Yami Lester,nan Aboriginal man,,was running a health service.,Eighty percent of what walkednin the door, in terms of illness,,was infectious disease --,third world, developing worldninfectious disease,,caused by a poor living environment. 
 Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.,He got a medical doctor.,He got an environmental health guy.,And he hand-selected a teamnof local Aboriginal people,to work on this project.,Yami told us at that first meeting,,"There's no money," --nalways a good start --," ... no money, you have six months,,and I want you to start on a project --"nwhich, in his language,,he called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,",which, translated, is "a plannto stop people getting sick" --,a profound brief.,That was our task. 
 First step, the medical doctor went awaynfor about six months.,And he worked on what were to becomenthese nine health goals --,what were we aiming at?,After six months of work,nhe came to my office,and presented me withnthose nine words on a piece of paper. 
 [The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing,nclothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,,animals, dust, temperature, injury] 
 I was very unimpressed.nBig ideas need big words,,and preferably a lot of them.,This didn't fit the bill.,What I didn't see and what you can't see,was that he'd assembled thousands of pages,of local, nationalnand international health research,that filled out the picturenas to why these were the health targets. 
 The pictures that came a bit laternhad a very simple reason.,The Aboriginal people who were our bossesnand the senior people,were most commonly illiterate,,so the story had to be told in pictures,of what these goals were.,We worked with the community,,not telling them what was going to happen,in a language they didn't understand. 
 So we had the goalsnand each one of these goals --,and I won't go through them all --,puts at the center the personnand their health issue,,and it then connects them,to the bits of the physicalnenvironment that are actually needed,to keep their health good.,And the highest priority,nyou see on the screen,,is washing people once a day,nparticularly children. 
 And I hope most of you are thinking,,"What? That sounds simple." 
 Now, I'm going to ask you allna very personal question.,This morning before you came,,who could have had a wash using a shower?,I'm not going to ask if you had a shower,nbecause I'm too polite.,That's it. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, I think it's fair to say,most people here could have hadna shower this morning. 
 I'm going to ask you to do some more work.,I want you all to select one of the houses,of the 25 houses you see on the screen.,I want you to select one of themnand note the position of that house,and keep that in your head.,Have you all got a house?,I'm going to ask you to live therenfor a few months,,so make sure you've got it right.,It's in the northwest ofnWestern Australia, very pleasant place. 
 OK. Let's see if your showernin that house is working.,I hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!" 
 If you get a green tick,nyour shower's working.,You and your kids are fine.,If you get a red cross,,well, I've looked carefullynaround the room,and it's not going to makenmuch difference to this crew.,Why? Because you're all too old.,I know that's going to come as a shocknto some of you, but you are.,And before you get offended and leave,,I've got to say that being too old,,in this case, means that pretty muchneveryone in the room, I think,,is over five years of age. 
 We're really concernednwith kids naught to five.,And why?,Washing is the antidotento the sort of bugs,,the common infectious diseasesnof the eyes, the ears,,the chest and the skin,that, if they occur in the firstnfive years of life,,permanently damage those organs.,They leave a lifelong remnant.,That means that by the age of five,,you can't see as wellnfor the rest of your life.,You can't hear as wellnfor the rest of your life.,You can't breathe as well.,You've lost a third of your lungncapacity by the age of five.,And even skin infection,,which we originally thoughtnwasn't that big a problem,,mild skin infectionsnnaught to five give you,a greatly increasednchance of renal failure,,needing dialysis at age 40.,This is a big deal, so the ticksnand crosses on the screen,are actually critical for young kids. 
 Those ticks and crossesnrepresent the 7,800 houses,we've looked at nationallynaround Australia,,the same proportion.,What you see on the screen --,35 percent of those not-so-famous houses,lived in by 50,000 indigenous people --,35 percent had a working shower.,Ten percent of those same 7,800 housesnhad safe electrical systems.,And 58 percent of those housesnhad a working toilet.,These are by a simple, standard test.,In the case of the shower:,does it have hot and cold water,ntwo taps that work,,a shower rose to get waternonto your head or onto your body,,and a drain that takes the water away?,Not well-designed,nnot beautiful, not elegant --,just that they function.,And the same testsnfor the electrical system,and the toilets. 
 Housing for Health projectsnaren't about measuring failure --,they're actually about improving houses.,We start on day one of every project.,We've learned -- we don't make promises,nwe don't do reports.,We arrive in the morning with tools,ntons of equipment, trades,,and we train up a local teamnon the first day to start work.,By the evening of the first day,,a few houses in that community are betternthan when we started in the morning. 
 That work continues for six to 12 months,,until all the houses are improved,and we've spent our budgetnof 7,500 dollars total per house.,That's our average budget.,At the end of six months to a year,nwe test every house again.,It's very easy to spend money.,It's very difficult to improve,the function of all thosenparts of the house.,And for a whole house,nthe nine healthy living practices,,we test, check and fixn250 items in every house. 
 And these are the results we can getnwith our 7,500 dollars.,We can get showersnup to 86 percent working,,we can get electrical systemsnup to 77 percent working,and we can get 90 percentnof toilets working,in those 7,500 houses.,(Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 The teams do a great job,nand that's their work. 
 I think there's an obvious question,that I hope you're thinking about.,Why do we have to do this work?,Why are the houses in such poor condition?,Seventy percent of the work we donis due to lack of routine maintenance --,the sort of things that happennin all our houses.,Things wear out, should have been donenby state government or local government,,simply not done, the house doesn't work.,Twenty-one percent of the things we fixnare due to faulty construction --,literally things that are builtnupside down and back to front.,They don't work, we have to fix them. 
 And if you've lived in Australianin the last 30 years, the final cause --,you will have heard alwaysnthat indigenous people trash houses.,It's one of the almostnrock-solid pieces of evidence,which I've never seen evidence for,,that's always reeled out as "That'snthe problem with indigenous housing.",Well, nine percentnof what we spend is damage,,misuse or abuse of any sort.,We argue strongly that the peoplenliving in the house,are simply not the problem.,And we'll go a lot further than that;,the people living in the housenare actually a major part of the solution.,Seventy-five percentnof our national team in Australia --,over 75 at the minute --,are actually local, indigenous peoplenfrom the communities we work in.,They do all aspects of the work. 
 (Applause) 
 In 2010, for example, there were 831,,all over Australia,nand the Torres Strait Islands,,all states, working to improve the housesnwhere they and their families live,,and that's an important thing. 
 Our work's always had a focus on health.,That's the key.,The developing world bug,ntrachoma, causes blindness.,It's a developing-world illness,,and yet, the picture you see behind,is in an Aboriginal communitynin the late 1990s,,where 95 percent of school-agednkids had active trachoma,in their eyes, doing damage. 
 OK, what do we do?,Well, first thing we do,nwe get showers working.,Why? Because that flushes the bug out.,We put washing facilitiesnin the school as well,,so kids can wash their facesnmany times during the day.,We wash the bug out. 
 Second, the eye doctors tell usnthat dust scours the eye,and lets the bug in quick.,So what do we do?,We call up the doctor of dust,nand there is such a person.,He was loaned to us by a mining company.,He controls dust on mining company sites.,And he came out and, within a day,,it worked out that most dustnin this community,was within a meter of the ground,nthe wind-driven dust --,so he suggested making moundsnto catch the dust,before it went into the house areanand affected the eyes of kids.,So we used dirt to stop dust.,We did it. He provided us dust monitors.,We tested and we reduced the dust. 
 Then we wanted to get ridnof the bug generally.,So how do we do that?,Well, we call up the doctor of flies --nand, yes, there is a doctor of flies.,As our Aboriginal mate said,,"You white fellows ought to get out more." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the doctor of fliesnvery quickly determined,that there was one flynthat carried the bug.,He could give school kidsnin this community,the beautiful fly trap you seenabove in the slide.,They could trap the flies,nsend them to him in Perth.,When the bug was in the gut,,he'd send back by return postnsome dung beetles.,The dung beetles ate the camel dung,,the flies died through lack of food,,and trachoma dropped.,And over the year, trachoma droppednradically in this place, and stayed low.,We changed the environment,nnot just treated the eyes.,And finally, you get a good eye. 
 All these small health gains,and small pieces of the puzzlenmake a big difference.,The New South Wales Department of Health,,that radical organization,,did an independent trial over three years,to look at 10 years of the worknwe've been doing,in these sorts of projectsnin New South Wales.,And they found a 40 percent reductionnin hospital admissions,for the illnesses that you could attributento the poor environment --,a 40 percent reduction. 
 (Applause) 
 Just to show that the principlesnwe've used in Australia,can be used in other places,,I'm just going to gonto one other place, and that's Nepal.,And what a beautiful place to go.,We were asked by a smallnvillage of 600 people,to go in and make toiletsnwhere none existed.,Health was poor.,We went in with no grand plan,,no grand promises of a great program,,just the offer to buildntwo toilets for two families.,It was during the designnof the first toilet,that I went for lunch,,invited by the familyninto their main room of the house.,It was choking with smoke.,People were cookingnon their only fuel source, green timber.,The smoke coming offnthat timber is choking,,and in an enclosed house,nyou simply can't breathe.,Later we found the leading causenof illness and death,in this particular regionnis through respiratory failure. 
 So all of a sudden, we had two problems.,We were there originallynto look at toilets,and get human wastenoff the ground, that's fine.,But all of a sudden nownthere was a second problem:,How do we actually get the smoke down?,So two problems, and design shouldnbe about more than one thing.,Solution: Take human waste,ntake animal waste,,put it into a chamber,nout of that, extract biogas,,methane gas.,The gas gives three to fournhours cooking a day --,clean, smokeless and free for the family. 
 (Applause) 
 I put it to you:nis this eliminating poverty?,And the answer from the Nepali teamnwho's working at the minute would say,,don't be ridiculous --,we have three millionnmore toilets to build,before we can even makena stab at that claim.,And I don't pretend anything else. 
 But as we all sit here today,,there are now over 100 toilets built,in this village and a couple nearby.,Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.,Yami Lama, he's a young boy.,He's got significantly less gut infectionnbecause he's now got toilets,,and there isn't human waste on the ground.,Kanji Maya, she's a mother,nand a proud one.,She's probably right nowncooking lunch for her family,on biogas, smokeless fuel.,Her lungs have got better,,and they'll get better as time increases,,because she's not cookingnin the same smoke.,Surya takes the wastenout of the biogas chamber,when it's shed the gas,nhe puts it on his crops.,He's trebled his crop income,,more food for the familynand more money for the family.,And finally Bishnu,nthe leader of the team,,has now understood that not onlynhave we built toilets,,we've also built a team,,and that team is nownworking in two villages,where they're training upnthe next two villages,to keep the work expanding.,And that, to me, is the key. 
 (Applause) 
 People are not the problem.,We've never found that.,The problem: poor living environment,,poor housing and the bugsnthat do people harm.,None of those are limited by geography,nby skin color or by religion.,None of them.,The common link between allnthe work we've had to do,is one thing, and that's poverty. 
 Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s,nnot too far from here,,he said that like slavery and apartheid,n"Poverty is not natural.,It is man-made and can benovercome and eradicated,by the actions of human beings.",I want to end by saying,it's been the actions of thousandsnof ordinary human beings,doing -- I think -- extraordinary work,,that have actually improved health,,and, maybe only in a small way,nreduced poverty. 
 Thank you very much for your time. 
 (Applause)My name is Tom,,and I've come here today to come clean,about what I do for money.,Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways,in exchange for cash.,(Laughter),I usually do this kind of thingnin seedy downtown bars,and on street corners,,so this mightn't benthe most appropriate setting,,but I'd like to give you guysna bit of a demonstration,about what I do.,(Beatboxing),And now, for my next number,,I'd like to return to the classics.,(Applause),We're going to take it back,,way back,,back into time.,(Beatboxing: "Billie Jean"),♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫,♫ She's just a girl who claimsnthat I am the one ♫,♫ But the kid is not my son ♫,(Applause) All right.,Wassup.,Thank you very much, TEDx.,If you guys haven'tnfigured it out already,,my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,,which means all the soundsnthat you just heard,were made entirely using just my voice,,and the only thing was my voice.,And I can assure you,there are absolutely no effects,on this microphone whatsoever.,And I'm very, very stoked —,(Applause),You guys are just applaudingnfor everything. It's great.,Look at this, Mom! I made it!,I'm very, very stoked to be here today,,representing my kinfolk,and all those that haven'tnmanaged to make a career,out of an innate abilitynfor inhuman noisemaking.,Because it is a bit of a niche market,,and there's not much work going on,,especially where I'm from.,You know, I'm from Brisbane,,which is a great city to live in.,Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here.nThat's good.,(Laughter),You know, I'm from Brizzy,,which is a great city to live in,,but let's be honest --,it's not exactly the culturalnhub of the Southern Hemisphere.,So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane,and outside Australia,,and so the pursuit of thisncrazy passion of mine,has enabled me to see,so many amazing places in the world.,So I'd like to share with you,nif I may, my experiences.,So ladies and gentlemen,,I would like to take you on a journey,throughout the continents,and throughout sound itself.,We start our journeynin the central deserts.,(Didgeridoo),(Airplane),India.,(Beatboxing),(Sitar),China.,(Guzheng),(Beatboxing),Germany.,(Beatboxing),Party, party, yeah.,(Laughter),And before we reach our final destination,,ladies and gentlemen,,I would like to sharenwith you some technology,that I brought all the waynfrom the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.,These things in front of menhere are called Kaoss Pads,,and they allow me to do a wholenlot of different things,with my voice.,For example, the one on the left here,allows me to add,a little bit of reverb to my sound,,which gives me that --,(Trumpet) --,flavor.,(Laughter),And the other ones here,,I can use them in unison,to mimic the effect of a drum machine,or something like that.,I can sample in my own soundsnand I can play it back,just by hitting the pads here.,(Noises),TEDx.,(Music),(Applause),I got way too much time on my hands.,And last but not least,,the one on my right here allows me to,loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop,my voice.,So with all that in mind,nladies and gentlemen,,I would like to take you on a journey,to a completely separate part of Earth,as I transform the Sydney Opera House,into a smoky downtown jazz bar.,All right boys, take it away.,(Music),Ladies and gentlemen,nI'd like to introduce you,to a very special friend of mine,,one of the greatestndouble bassists I know.,Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's takenit for a walk. Come on, baby.,(Music),All right, ladies and gentlemen,,I'd like to introduce younto the star of the show,,one of the greatest jazznlegends of our time.,Music lovers and jazz lovers alike,,please give a warm hand of applause,for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom.nTake it away.,(Music),(Applause),Thank you. Thank you very much.,(Applause)For a long time in my life,,I felt like I'd been living two different lives.,There's the life that everyone sees,,and then there's the life that only I see.,And in the life that everyone sees,,who I am is a friend,,a son, a brother,,a stand-up comedian and a teenager.,That's the life everyone sees.,If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,,that's what they would tell you.,And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.,And if you were to ask me to describe myself,,I'd probably say some of those same things.,And I wouldn't be lying,,but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,,because the truth is,,that's just the life everyone else sees.,In the life that only I see, who I am,,who I really am,,is someone who struggles intensely with depression.,I have for the last six years of my life,,and I continue to every day. 
 Now, for someone who has never experienced depression,or doesn't really know what that means,,that might surprise them to hear,,because there's this pretty popular misconception,that depression is just being sad,when something in your life goes wrong,,when you break up with your girlfriend,,when you lose a loved one,,when you don't get the job you wanted.,But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.,That's a natural human emotion.,Real depression isn't being sad,when something in your life goes wrong.,Real depression is being sad,when everything in your life is going right.,That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from. 
 And to be totally honest,,that's hard for me to stand up here and say.,It's hard for me to talk about,,and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,,so much so that no one's talking about it.,And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,,because right now it's a massive problem.,It's a massive problem.,But we don't see it on social media, right?,We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.,We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,,it's not fun, it's not light.,And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it. 
 But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:,every 30 seconds,,every 30 seconds, somewhere,,someone in the world takes their own life,because of depression,,and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,,it might be two continents away, but it's happening,,and it's happening every single day.,And we have a tendency, as a society,,to look at that and go, "So what?",So what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.,That's their problem.",We say we're sad and we say we're sorry,,but we also say, "So what?" 
 Well, two years ago it was my problem,,because I sat on the edge of my bed,where I'd sat a million times before,and I was suicidal.,I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,,you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.,You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,,the drama and theater student of the year,,the English student of the year,,someone who was consistently on the honor roll,and consistently at every party.,So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say,I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.,You would be wrong. So I sat there that night,beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand,and I thought about taking my own life,and I came this close to doing it.,I came this close to doing it. 
 And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,,one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge,and look down but not jump,,one of the lucky ones who survives.,Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,,and my story is this:,In four simple words, I suffer from depression.,I suffer from depression,,and for a long time, I think,,I was living two totally different lives,,where one person was always afraid of the other.,I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,,that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,,that beneath my smile, there was struggle,,and beneath my light, there was dark,,and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain. 
 See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.,Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.,But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.,I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,,and that fear made me feel,like I was forced into a corner,,like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,,and so I thought about that way every single day.,I thought about it every single day,,and if I'm being totally honest, standing here,I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,,that's the struggle, that's depression,,and depression isn't chicken pox.,You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.,It's something you live with. It's something you live in.,It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.,It's the feelings you can't seem to escape,,the scariest part is that after a while,,you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,,and what you really fear the most,isn't the suffering inside of you.,It's the stigma inside of others,,it's the shame, it's the embarrassment,,it's the disapproving look on a friend's face,,it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,,it's the comments that you're crazy.,That's what keeps you from getting help.,That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.,It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,,and you hold it in and you hide it,,and even though it's keeping you in bed every day,and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,,you hide it, because the stigma in our society,around depression is very real.,It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:,Would you rather make your next Facebook status,say you're having a tough time getting out of bed,because you hurt your back,or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning,because you're depressed?,That's the stigma, because unfortunately,,we live in a world where if you break your arm,,everyone runs over to sign your cast,,but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.,That's the stigma.,We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down,other than our brains. And that's ignorance.,That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created,a world that doesn't understand depression,,that doesn't understand mental health.,And that's ironic to me, because depression,is one of the best documented problems we have in the world,,yet it's one of the least discussed.,We just push it aside and put it in a corner,and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself. 
 Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,,because that's wishful thinking,,and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,,and we can't procrastinate on something this important.,The first step in solving any problem,is recognizing there is one.,Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect,to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question. 
 And I don't know what the solution is.,I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think,,I think it has to start here.,It has to start with me, it has to start with you,,it has to start with the people who are suffering,,the ones who are hidden in the shadows.,We need to speak up and shatter the silence.,We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,,because if there's one thing that I've come to realize,,if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,,it's not in building a world,where we eliminate the ignorance of others.,It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,,where we're okay with who we are,,because when we get honest,,we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.,Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else,,we all know what it is to hurt.,We all know what it is to have pain in our heart,,and we all know how important it is to heal.,But right now, depression is society's deep cut,that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there. 
 Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.,Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.,And know that you're sick, you're not weak,,and it's an issue, not an identity,,because when you get past the fear and the ridicule,and the judgment and the stigma of others,,you can see depression for what it really is,,and that's just a part of life,,just a part of life, and as much as I hate,,as much as I hate some of the places,,some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,,in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.,Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys,,but only to show me there's peaks,,and yeah it's dragged me through the dark,but only to remind me there is light.,My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,,has given me perspective, and my hurt,,my hurt has forced me to have hope,,have hope and to have faith, faith in myself,,faith in others, faith that it can get better,,that we can change this, that we can speak up,and speak out and fight back against ignorance,,fight back against intolerance,,and more than anything,,learn to love ourselves,,learn to accept ourselves for who we are,,the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.,Because the world I believe in is one,where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.,The world I believe in is one where we're measured,by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.,The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye,and say, "I'm going through hell,",and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,,and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.,We're people, and we struggle and we suffer,and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength,means never showing any weakness, then I'm here,to tell you you're wrong.,You're wrong, because it's the opposite.,We're people, and we have problems.,We're not perfect, and that's okay. 
 So we need to stop the ignorance,,stop the intolerance, stop the stigma,,and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,,take a look at the truth, and start talking,,because the only way we're going to beat a problem,that people are battling alone,is by standing strong together,,by standing strong together. 
 And I believe that we can.,I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.,This is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)Everyone needs a coach.,It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,,a tennis player, a gymnast,or a bridge player.,(Laughter) 
 My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,,says there are more pictures of the back of her head,than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter),Sorry, Sharon. Here you go. 
 We all need people who will give us feedback.,That's how we improve.,Unfortunately, there's one group of people,who get almost no systematic feedback,to help them do their jobs better,,and these people,have one of the most important jobs in the world.,I'm talking about teachers.,When Melinda and I learned,how little useful feedback most teachers get,,we were blown away.,Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers,just got one word of feedback:,Satisfactory.,If all my bridge coach ever told me,was that I was "satisfactory,",I would have no hope of ever getting better.,How would I know who was the best?,How would I know what I was doing differently?,Today, districts are revamping,the way they evaluate teachers,,but we still give them almost no feedback,that actually helps them improve their practice.,Our teachers deserve better.,The system we have today isn't fair to them.,It's not fair to students,,and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.,So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers,get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. 
 Let's start by asking who's doing well.,Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables,for teacher feedback systems.,So I looked at the countries,whose students perform well academically,,and looked at what they're doing,to help their teachers improve.,Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.,The U.S. isn't number one.,We're not even in the top 10.,We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.,Now, out of all the places,that do better than the U.S. in reading,,how many of them have a formal system,for helping teachers improve?,Eleven out of 14.,The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,,but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.,So there's really only one area where we're near the top,,and that's in failing to give our teachers,the help they need to develop their skills. 
 Let's look at the best academic performer:,the province of Shanghai, China.,Now, they rank number one across the board,,in reading, math and science,,and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success,is the way they help teachers keep improving.,They made sure that younger teachers,get a chance to watch master teachers at work.,They have weekly study groups,,where teachers get together and talk about what's working.,They even require each teacher to observe,and give feedback to their colleagues. 
 You might ask, why is a system like this so important?,It's because there's so much variation,in the teaching profession.,Some teachers are far more effective than others.,In fact, there are teachers throughout the country,who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.,If today's average teacher,could become as good as those teachers,,our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.,So we need a system that helps all our teachers,be as good as the best. 
 What would that system look like?,Well, to find out, our foundation,has been working with 3,000 teachers,in districts across the country,on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.,We had observers watch videos,of teachers in the classroom,and rate how they did on a range of practices.,For example, did they ask their students,challenging questions?,Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?,We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,,"Does your teacher know,when the class understands a lesson?","Do you learn to correct your mistakes?" 
 And what we found is very exciting.,First, the teachers who did well on these observations,had far better student outcomes.,So it tells us we're asking the right questions.,And second, teachers in the program told us,that these videos and these surveys from the students,were very helpful diagnostic tools,,because they pointed to specific places,where they can improve.,I want to show you what this video component of MET,looks like in action. 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.,Let's talk about what's going on today.,To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?,A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class,is for you to be able to determine,whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. 
 My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.,I am a high school English teacher,at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa. 
 Turn to somebody next to you.,Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about -- 
 I think that there is a difference for teachers,between the abstract of how we see our practice,and then the concrete reality of it. 
 Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers. 
 I think what video offers for us,is a certain degree of reality.,You can't really dispute what you see on the video,,and there is a lot to be learned from that,,and there are a lot of ways that we can grow,as a profession when we actually get to see this.,I just have a flip camera and a little tripod,and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.,At the beginning of class, I just perch it,in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.,It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.,But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.,And I'm able to learn a lot from it.,So it really has been a simple,but powerful tool in my own reflection. 
 All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay? 
 Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,,and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.,If I don't write things down, I don't remember them. 
 So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,,and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.,I really have used it for my own personal growth,and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy,and methodology and classroom management,,and just all of those different facets of the classroom. 
 I'm glad that we've actually done the process before,so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't. 
 I think that video exposes,so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers,in ways that help us learn and help us understand,,and then help our broader communities understand,what this complex work is really all about.,I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate,things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,,things you cannot convey in a standard,,things that you cannot even sometimes convey,in a book of pedagogy. 
 Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.,I'll see you later. 
 [Every classroom could look like that] 
 (Applause) 
 Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America,to look something like that.,But we still have more work to do.,Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve,is only half the battle.,We also have to give them the tools they need,to act on the diagnosis.,If you learn that you need to improve,the way you teach fractions,,you should be able to watch a video,of the best person in the world teaching fractions. 
 So building this complete teacher feedback,and improvement system won't be easy.,For example, I know some teachers,aren't immediately comfortable with the idea,of a camera in the classroom.,That's understandable, but our experience with MET,suggests that if teachers manage the process,,if they collect video in their own classrooms,,and they pick the lessons they want to submit,,a lot of them will be eager to participate. 
 Building this system will also require,a considerable investment.,Our foundation estimates that it could cost,up to five billion dollars.,Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,,it's less than two percent,of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. 
 The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.,We would finally have a way to give them feedback,,as well as the means to act on it. 
 But this system would have,an even more important benefit for our country.,It would put us on a path to making sure,all our students get a great education,,find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,,and have a chance to live out their dreams.,This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.,It would also make us a more fair and just one, too. 
 I'm excited about the opportunity,to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.,I hope you are too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,,she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks." 
 I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks." 
 She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- " 
 I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter) 
 She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man.",(Laughter) 
 So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,,I'm gonna be good. I am.",But I am angry. (Laughter),And the last time I looked, I'm -- 
 (Applause),So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.,This year, there are going to be millions of our children,that we're going to needlessly lose,,that we could -- right now, we could save them all.,You saw the quality of the educators who were here.,Do not tell me they could not reach those kids,and save them. I know they could.,It is absolutely possible.,Why haven't we fixed this?,Those of us in education have held on to a business plan,that we don't care how many millions of young people fail,,we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,,and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --,enough to say, "Enough is enough.",So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. 
 You know, I grew up in the inner city,,and there were kids who were failing,in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,,and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.,And you know something about a lousy school?,It's not like a bottle of wine.,Right? (Laughter),Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?,That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,,it's still the same approach, right?,One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,,tough luck. Just tough luck.,Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?,Do not tell me we can't do better than this. 
 Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,,and you say, "So what's the plan?",And they say, "We'll, we're going to do,what we did last year this year.",What kind of business model is that?,Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.,They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.,Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.,They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.,Who created that business model? Right?,And it went on for decades.,You know why? Because they didn't care.,It wasn't about the customers.,It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.,How could you go to the bank,when you were at work? It didn't matter.,And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset,he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.,They all operate the same way. Right?,Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.,Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.,They might like that. What about a Saturday?,What about introducing technology? 
 Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit,to you all I'm a little old.,So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,,and when they first came out with those new contraptions,,these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,,I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.,I am never using that, right?" 
 So technology has changed. Things have changed.,Yet not in education. Why?,Why is it that when we had rotary phones,,when we were having folks being crippled by polio,,that we were teaching,the same way then that we're doing right now?,And if you come up with a plan to change things,,people consider you radical.,They will say the worst things about you.,I said one day, well, look, if the science says --,this is science, not me -- that our poorest children,lose ground in the summertime --,You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.,You look at them in September, they've gone down.,You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75,when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.,I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study.",Because it suggests we should do something.,(Laughter),Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.,It says exactly the same thing:,Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.,The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. 
 You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?,For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.,I thought I knew something.,They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —,but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.,I never got that. I never got that,,because anyone knows if you farm,,you don't plant crops in July and August.,You plant them in the spring.,So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?,Why did we ever do it?,Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,,schools were open all year. They were open all year,,because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.,They didn't have any place for their kids to go.,It was a perfect place to have schools.,So this is not something that is ordained,from the education gods. 
 So why don't we? Why don't we?,Because our business has refused to use science.,Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,,"Look, this works, right? We can do this.",How many places in America are going to change? None.,None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?,Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.,As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear. 
 Here's what we know.,We know that the problem begins immediately.,Right? This idea, zero to three.,My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,,three grown ones and a 15-year-old.,That's a longer story.,(Laughter),With our first kids, we did not know the science,about brain development.,We didn't know how critical those first three years were.,We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.,We didn't know the role that language,,a stimulus and response, call and response,,how important that was in developing those children.,We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.,Wealthy people know. Educated people know.,And their kids have an advantage.,Poor people don't know,,and we're not doing anything to help them at all.,But we know this is critical. 
 Now, you take pre-kindergarten.,We know it's important for kids.,Poor kids need that experience.,Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.,We know health services matter.,You know, we provide health services,and people are always fussing at me about, you know,,because I'm all into accountability and data,and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,,and I have to raise a lot of money.,People used to say when they'd come fund us,,"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?",I used to make stuff up. Right?,I'd say, "Well, you know a child,who has cavities is not going to, uh,,be able to study as well.",And I had to because I had to raise the money.,But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?,You know why I provide kids with those health benefits,and the sports and the recreation and the arts?,Because I actually like kids.,I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause) 
 But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,,I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid.",And you've never read a study from MIT that says,giving your kid dance instruction,is going to help them do algebra better,,but you will give that kid dance instruction,,and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,,and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids,have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.,(Applause) 
 So here's the other thing.,I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,,because you work at something, you think it's working,,and you find out it's not working.,I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,,you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.,But here's the problem with testing.,The testing that we do --,we're going to have our test in New York next week —,is in April.,You know when we're going to get the results back?,Maybe July, maybe June.,And the results have great data.,They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,,couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,,but you're getting it back after school is over.,And so, what do you do?,You go on vacation. (Laughter),You come back from vacation.,Now you've got all of this test data from last year.,You don't look at it.,Why would you look at it?,You're going to go and teach this year.,So how much money did we just spend on all of that?,Billions and billions of dollars,for data that it's too late to use.,I need that data in September.,I need that data in November.,I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know,whether or not what I did corrected that.,I need to know that this week.,I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. 
 Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.,I can predict school scores.,You take me to any school.,I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.,And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids,were on grade level.,And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do,from last year to this year?",You say, "We're doing the same thing.",I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter),This year, somewhere between 44,and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.,And I will be right every single time. 
 So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?,Teachers need real information right now,about what's happening to their kids.,The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it. 
 So here's the other issue that I just think,we've got to be concerned about.,We can't stifle innovation in our business.,We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.,They get angry if you do something different.,If you try something new, people are always like,,"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.,This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.,Let's try something different. And here's the rub.,Some of it's not going to work.,You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work.",A lot of them don't. They should be closed.,I mean, I really believe they should be closed.,But we can't confuse figuring out the science,and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.,Right? Because that's not the way the world works. 
 If you think about technology,,imagine if that's how we thought about technology.,Every time something didn't work,,we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?,You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --,the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.,They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot,you'll never need another thing.",That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.,I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.,Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.,The folks went out there. They kept inventing.,The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you,from pushing the science forward. 
 Our job as educators,,there's some stuff we know that we can do.,And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,,we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.,We've got to give them all of these opportunities.,So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,,this idea that we've got to keep innovating,until we really nail this science down,is something that is absolutely critical. 
 And this is something, by the way,,that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.,America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.,We have run out of time.,I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff,that we are walking over right this very second,,and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness,about saying we can't afford this —,So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.,What is five billion dollars to the United States?,What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?,How many trillions? (Applause) 
 When the country cares about something,,we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.,When the safety of America is threatened,,we will spend any amount of money.,The real safety of our nation,is preparing this next generation,so that they can take our place,and be the leaders of the world,when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy,and all that stuff we care about.,I dare say it's a pittance,,what it would require for us to really,begin to solve some of these problems. 
 So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter),So, you guys, help me get there.,Thank you all very much. Thank you.,(Applause) 
 John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone? 
 Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,,100 percent of our kids graduated high school,last year in my school.,A hundred percent of them went to college.,This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.,Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.,We'd better get that other seven percent.,So that's just how this goes. (Applause) 
 JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school? 
 GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems,we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,,these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,,they drop out in record numbers.,And so we've figured out that you've got to really design,a network of support for these kids that in many ways,mimics what a good parent does.,They harass you, right? They call you, they say,,"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?,What are you talking about that you want to leave school?,And you're not coming back here.",So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem,because Geoff is looking for you.,They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.,But I'm not kidding about some of this,,and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.,When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,,it puts a different pressure on them,,and they don't give up as easy.,So sometimes they don't have it inside,,and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,,but I know my mother's going to be mad.",Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.,We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring,and help and support, but also a set of encouragements,that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,,but we refuse to let you fail." 
 JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.,Please give it up for him one more time. 
 (Applause)At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building,dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.,I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day,by regular janitors,,but I never have the decency to honor their names.,Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths,when teenage girls wear clothes that covers,their insecurities but exposes everything else.,Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,,camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed,but need hugs.,Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.,Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons,but never learn to swim,,part like the Red Sea when the bell rings. 
 This is a training ground.,My high school is Chicago,,diverse and segregated on purpose.,Social lines are barbed wire.,Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.,I am an Honors but go home with Regular students,who are soldiers in territory that owns them.,This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars,from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle,built to recycle the trash of this system. 
 Trained at a young age to capitalize,,letters taught now that capitalism raises you,but you have to step on someone else to get there.,This is a training ground where one group,is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.,No wonder so many of my people spit bars,,because the truth is hard to swallow.,The need for degrees has left so many people frozen. 
 Homework is stressful,,but when you go home every day and your home is work,,you don't want to pick up any assignments.,Reading textbooks is stressful,,but reading does not matter when you feel,your story is already written,,either dead or getting booked.,Taking tests is stressful,,but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop,bullets from bursting. 
 I hear education systems are failing,,but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --,to train you, to keep you on track,,to track down an American dream that has failed,so many of us all. 
 (Applause)So I grew up in East Los Angeles,,not even realizing I was poor.,My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.,Everyone knew who I was,,so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,,and even though my dad spent most of my life,in and out of jail,,I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.,She worked at the local high school,as a secretary in the dean's office,,so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,,for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.,Man, her office was packed. 
 So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with,outside of school,,and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.,But that doesn't mean that we can't.,It just takes a little bit more.,Like, I remember one day I found my dad,convulsing, foaming at the mouth,,OD-ing on the bathroom floor.,Really, do you think that doing my homework that night,was at the top of my priority list?,Not so much. 
 But I really needed a support network,,a group of people who were going to help me,make sure that I wasn't going to be,a victim of my own circumstance,,that they were going to push me,beyond what I even thought I could do.,I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,,who were going to say, "You can move beyond that.",And unfortunately, the local junior high,was not going to offer that.,It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate. 
 So my mom said, "You're going on a bus,an hour and a half away from where we live every day.",So for the next two years, that's what I did.,I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.,And eventually, I ended up at a school,where there was a mixture.,There were some people who were really gang-affiliated,,and then there were those of us,really trying to make it to high school.,Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.,You had to survive.,You just had to do things sometimes.,So there were a lot of teachers who were like,,"She's never going to make it.,She has an issue with authority.,She's not going to go anywhere.",Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. 
 But then, they were very surprised,when I graduated from high school.,I was accepted to Pepperdine University,,and I came back to the same school that I attended,to be a special ed assistant. 
 And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher." 
 And boy, they were like, "What? Why?,Why would you want to do that?" 
 So I began my teaching career,at the exact same middle school that I attended,,and I really wanted to try to save more kids,who were just like me.,And so every year, I share my background with my kids,,because they need to know that everyone has a story,,everyone has a struggle,,and everyone needs help along the way.,And I am going to be their help along the way. 
 So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.,I had a kid one day come into my class,having been stabbed the night before. 
 I was like, "You need to go to a hospital,,the school nurse, something." 
 He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.,I need to be in class because I need to graduate.",So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim,of his circumstance,,but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.,And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids,and getting to know exactly what they're going through,,getting to know their families -- I wanted that,,but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,,and teachers turning over year after year after year.,How do you get to build those relationships? 
 So we created a new school.,And we created,the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.,And we made sure that we were still attached,to our school district for funding, for support.,But with that, we were going to gain freedom:,freedom to hire the teachers,that we knew were going to be effective;,freedom to control the curriculum,so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;,and freedom to control a budget,,to spend money where it matters,,not how a district or a state says you have to do it.,We wanted those freedoms.,But now, shifting an entire paradigm,,it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.,But we had to do it.,Our community deserved a new way of doing things. 
 And as the very first pilot middle school,in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,,you better believe there was some opposition.,And it was out of fear --,fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?,Yeah, what if we get it wrong?,But what if we get it right?,And we did.,So even though teachers were against it,because we employ one-year contracts --,you can't teach, or you don't want to teach,,you don't get to be at my school with my kids. 
 (Applause) 
 So in our third year, how did we do it?,Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.,We make our kids feel like they matter to us.,We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,,and they use all the technology that they're used to.,Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.,Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.,And because we connect it to what they're doing —,For example, they made public service announcements,for the Cancer Society.,These were played in the local trolley system.,Teaching elements of persuasion,,it doesn't get any more real than that.,Our state test scores have gone up,more than 80 points since we've become our own school. 
 But it's taken all stakeholders, working together --,teachers and principals on one-year contracts,,working over and above and beyond their contract hours,without compensation.,And it takes a school board member,who is going to lobby for you and say,,"Know, the district is trying to impose this,,but you have the freedom to do otherwise.",And it takes an active parent center,who is not only there, showing a presence every day,,but who is part of our governance,,making decisions for their kids, our kids. 
 Because why should our students have to go,so far away from where they live?,They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,,a school that they can be proud to say they attend,,and a school that the community can be proud of as well,,and they need teachers to fight for them every day,and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.,Because it's time that kids like me,stop being the exception, and we become the norm. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have spent my entire life,either at the schoolhouse,non the way to the schoolhouse,,or talking about what happensnin the schoolhouse. 
 (Laughter) 
 Both my parents were educators,,my maternal grandparents were educators,,and for the past 40 years,nI've done the same thing.,And so, needless to say, over those years,I've had a chancento look at education reform,from a lot of perspectives.,Some of those reforms have been good.,Some of them have been not so good.,And we know why kids drop out.,We know why kids don't learn.,It's either poverty, low attendance,,negative peer influences...,We know why.,But one of the thingsnthat we never discuss,or we rarely discuss,is the value and importancenof human connection.,Relationships. 
 James Comer saysnthat no significant learning,can occur withoutna significant relationship.,George Washington Carver says all learning,is understanding relationships.,Everyone in this room has been affectednby a teacher or an adult.,For years, I have watched people teach.,I have looked at the bestnand I've looked at some of the worst. 
 A colleague said to me one time,,"They don't pay me to like the kids.,They pay me to teach a lesson.,The kids should learn it.,I should teach it, they should learn it,,Case closed." 
 Well, I said to her,,"You know, kids don't learnnfrom people they don't like." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey." 
 And I said to her, 
 "Well, your year is going to benlong and arduous, dear." 
 Needless to say, it was.,Some people think that you can eithernhave it in you to build a relationship,,or you don't.,I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.,He said you ought to justnthrow in a few simple things,,like seeking first to understand,,as opposed to being understood.,Simple things, like apologizing.,You ever thought about that?,Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock. 
 (Laughter) 
 I taught a lesson once on ratios.,I'm not real good with math,nbut I was working on it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I got back and lookednat that teacher edition.,I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I came back to classnthe next day and I said,,"Look, guys, I need to apologize.,I taught the whole lesson wrong.nI'm so sorry." 
 They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.,You were so excited, we just let you go." 
 I have had classes that were so low,,so academically deficient, that I cried.,I wondered, "How am Ingoing to take this group,,in nine months,,from where they arento where they need to be?,And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.,How do I raise the self-esteem of a child,and his academic achievementnat the same time? 
 One year I came up with a bright idea.,I told all my students,,"You were chosen to be in my class,because I am the best teacher,and you are the best students,,they put us all together,so we could showneverybody else how to do it." 
 One of the students said, "Really?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "Really. We havento show the other classes,how to do it, so whennwe walk down the hall,,people will notice us,nso you can't make noise.,You just have to strut." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I gave them a saying to say:,"I am somebody.,I was somebody when I came.,I'll be a better somebody when I leave.,I am powerful, and I am strong.,I deserve the education that I get here.,I have things to do, people to impress,,and places to go." 
 And they said, "Yeah!" 
 (Laughter) 
 You say it long enough,,it starts to be a part of you. 
 (Applause) 
 I gave a quiz, 20 questions.,A student missed 18.,I put a "+2" on his papernand a big smiley face. 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?" 
 I said, "Yes." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "Then why'd younput a smiley face?" 
 I said, "Because you're on a roll.,You got two right.nYou didn't miss them all." 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "And when we review this,nwon't you do better?" 
 He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better." 
 You see, "-18" sucksnall the life out of you.,"+2" said, "I ain't all bad." 
 For years, I watched my motherntake the time at recess to review,,go on home visits in the afternoon,,buy combs and brushesnand peanut butter and crackers,to put in her desk drawernfor kids that needed to eat,,and a washcloth and some soapnfor the kids who didn't smell so good.,See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. 
 (Laughter) 
 And kids can be cruel.,And so she kept those things in her desk,,and years later, after she retired,,I watched some of thosensame kids come through,and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,,you made a difference in my life.,You made it work for me.,You made me feel like I was somebody,,when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.,And I want you to justnsee what I've become." 
 And when my mama died two years ago at 92,,there were so many formernstudents at her funeral,,it brought tears to my eyes,nnot because she was gone,,but because she leftna legacy of relationships,that could never disappear. 
 Can we stand to have more relationships?,Absolutely.,Will you like all your children?nOf course not. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you know your toughestnkids are never absent. 
 (Laughter) 
 Never.,You won't like them all,,and the tough ones show up for a reason.,It's the connection.nIt's the relationships.,So teachers becomengreat actors and great actresses,,and we come to worknwhen we don't feel like it,,and we're listening to policynthat doesn't make sense,,and we teach anyway.,We teach anyway,nbecause that's what we do. 
 Teaching and learning should bring joy.,How powerful would our world be,if we had kids who werennot afraid to take risks,,who were not afraid to think,,and who had a champion?,Every child deserves a champion,,an adult who will never give up on them,,who understands the power of connection,,and insists that they becomenthe best that they can possibly be. 
 Is this job tough? You betcha.,Oh God, you betcha.,But it is not impossible.,We can do this. We're educators.,We're born to make a difference. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk about consciousness.,Why consciousness?,Well, it's a curiously neglected subject,,both in our scientificnand our philosophical culture.,Now why is that curious?,Well, it is the most importantnaspect of our lives,for a very simple, logical reason,,namely, it's a necessaryncondition on anything,being important in our livesnthat we're conscious.,You care about science, philosophy,nmusic, art, whatever --,it's no good if you'rena zombie or in a coma, right?,So consciousness is number one.,The second reason is that when people do,get interested in it,nas I think they should,,they tend to saynthe most appalling things.,And then, even when they'rennot saying appalling things,and they're really tryingnto do serious research,,well, it's been slow.nProgress has been slow.,When I first got interestednin this, I thought, well,,it's a straightforward problem in biology.,Let's get these brain stabbersnto get busy and figure out,how it works in the brain.,So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all,the heavy-duty neurobiologists there,,and they showed some impatience,,as scientists often do when younask them embarrassing questions.,But the thing that struck me is,none guy said in exasperation,,a very famous neurobiologist,nhe said, "Look,,in my discipline it's okay to beninterested in consciousness,,but get tenure first. Get tenure first.",Now I've been workingnon this for a long time.,I think now you might actually get tenure,by working on consciousness.,If so, that's a real step forward.,Okay, now why then is thisncurious reluctance,and curious hostility to consciousness?,Well, I think it's a combinationnof two features,of our intellectual culture,that like to think they'renopposing each other,but in fact they sharena common set of assumptions.,One feature is the traditionnof religious dualism:,Consciousness is not a partnof the physical world.,It's a part of the spiritual world.,It belongs to the soul,,and the soul is not a partnof the physical world.,That's the tradition of God,nthe soul and immortality.,There's another traditionnthat thinks it's opposed to this,but accepts the worst assumption.,That tradition thinks that we are heavy-dutynscientific materialists:,Consciousness is not a partnof the physical world.,Either it doesn't exist at all,nor it's something else,,a computer programnor some damn fool thing,,but in any case it's not part of science.,And I used to get in an argumentnthat really gave me a stomachache.,Here's how it went.,Science is objective,nconsciousness is subjective,,therefore there cannot bena science of consciousness.,Okay, so these twinntraditions are paralyzing us.,It's very hard to getnout of these twin traditions.,And I have only one realnmessage in this lecture,,and that is, consciousnessnis a biological phenomenon,like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis --,you know all the biological phenomenan-- and once you accept that,,most, though not all, of the hard problems,about consciousness simply evaporate.,And I'm going to go through some of them.,Okay, now I promised you to tell you some,of the outrageous thingsnsaid about consciousness.,One: Consciousness does not exist.,It's an illusion, like sunsets.,Science has shown sunsetsnand rainbows are illusions.,So consciousness is an illusion.,Two: Well, maybe it exists,nbut it's really something else.,It's a computer programnrunning in the brain.,Three: No, the only thingnthat exists is really behavior.,It's embarrassing how influentialnbehaviorism was,,but I'll get back to that.,And four: Maybe consciousness exists,,but it can't makenany difference to the world.,How could spirituality move anything?,Now, whenever somebodyntells me that, I think,,you want to see spiritualitynmove something?,Watch. I decide consciouslynto raise my arm,,and the damn thing goes up. (Laughter),Furthermore, notice this:,We do not say, "Well, it's a bitnlike the weather in Geneva.,Some days it goes up and some daysnit doesn't go up.",No. It goes up whenevernI damn well want it to.,Okay. I'm going to tellnyou how that's possible.,Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.,You can't do this if youndon't give a definition.,People always say consciousnessnis very hard to define.,I think it's rather easy to define,if you're not trying to givena scientific definition.,We're not readynfor a scientific definition,,but here's a common-sense definition.,Consciousness consistsnof all those states of feeling,or sentience or awareness.,It begins in the morning when younwake up from a dreamless sleep,,and it goes on all daynuntil you fall asleep,or die or otherwise become unconscious.,Dreams are a form of consciousnessnon this definition.,Now, that's the common-sense definition.nThat's our target.,If you're not talking about that,nyou're not talking about consciousness.,But they think, "Well, if that's it,nthat's an awful problem.,How can such a thing existnas part of the real world?",And this, if you've evernhad a philosophy course,,this is known as the famousnmind-body problem.,I think that has a simple solution too.nI'm going to give it to you.,And here it is: All of our consciousnstates, without exception,,are caused by lower-levelnneurobiological processes in the brain,,and they are realized in the brain,as higher-level or system features.,It's about as mysteriousnas the liquidity of water.,Right? The liquidity is notnan extra juice squirted out,by the H2O molecules.,It's a condition that the system is in.,And just as the jar full of waterncan go from liquid to solid,depending on the behaviornof the molecules,,so your brain can gonfrom a state of being conscious,to a state of being unconscious,,depending on the behaviornof the molecules.,The famous mind-bodynproblem is that simple.,All right? But now we getninto some harder questions.,Let's specify the exactnfeatures of consciousness,,so that we can then answernthose four objections,that I made to it.,Well, the first feature is,nit's real and irreducible.,You can't get rid of it.,You see, the distinctionnbetween reality and illusion,is the distinction between how things,consciously seem to usnand how they really are.,It consciously seems like there's --,I like the French "arc-en-ciel" —,it seems like there's an arch in the sky,,or it seems like the sunnis setting over the mountains.,It consciously seems to us,nbut that's not really happening.,But for that distinction between,how things consciously seemnand how they really are,,you can't make that distinctionnfor the very existence of consciousness,,because where the very existencenof consciousness is concerned,,if it consciously seems to younthat you are conscious,,you are conscious.,I mean, if a bunch of expertsncome to me and say,,"We are heavy-duty neurobiologistsnand we've done a study,of you, Searle, and we'renconvinced you are not conscious,,you are a very cleverlynconstructed robot,",I don't think, "Well, maybe thesenguys are right, you know?",I don't think that for a moment,nbecause, I mean,,Descartes may have made a lotnof mistakes, but he was right about this.,You cannot doubt the existencenof your own consciousness.,Okay, that's the firstnfeature of consciousness.,It's real and irreducible.,You cannot get rid of itnby showing that it's an illusion,in a way that you cannwith other standard illusions.,Okay, the second feature is this one,that has been suchna source of trouble to us,,and that is, all of our conscious states,have this qualitative character to them.,There's something that itnfeels like to drink beer,which is not what it feelsnlike to do your income tax,or listen to music,nand this qualitative feel,automatically generates a third feature,,namely, conscious statesnare by definition subjective,in the sense that they only existnas experienced,by some human or animal subject,,some self that experiences them.,Maybe we'll be able to buildna conscious machine.,Since we don't know how our brains do it,,we're not in a position, so far,nto build a conscious machine.,Okay. Another feature of consciousness,is that it comes in unifiednconscious fields.,So I don't just have the sightnof the people in front of me,and the sound of my voicenand the weight of my shoes,against the floor, but they occur to me,as part of one singlengreat conscious field,that stretches forward and backward.,That is the key to understanding,the enormous power of consciousness.,And we have not been ablento do that in a robot.,The disappointment of roboticsnderives from the fact,that we don't know how to makena conscious robot,,so we don't have a machinenthat can do this kind of thing.,Okay, the next feature of consciousness,,after this marvelousnunified conscious field,,is that it functionsncausally in our behavior.,I gave you a scientificndemonstration by raising my hand,,but how is that possible?,How can it be that thisnthought in my brain,can move material objects?,Well, I'll tell you the answer.,I mean, we don't know the detailed answer,,but we know the basic partnof the answer, and that is,,there is a sequence of neuron firings,,and they terminate where the acetylcholine,is secreted at the axonnend-plates of the motor neurons.,Sorry to use philosophicalnterminology here,,but when it's secreted at the axonnend-plates of the motor neurons,,a whole lot of wonderful thingsnhappen in the ion channels,and the damned arm goes up.,Now, think of what I told you.,One and the same event,,my conscious decision to raise my arm,has a level of descriptionnwhere it has all of these,touchy-feely spiritual qualities.,It's a thought in my brain,nbut at the same time,,it's busy secreting acetylcholine,and doing all sorts of other things,as it makes its way from the motor cortex,down through the nerve fibers in the arm.,Now, what that tells usnis that our traditional vocabularies,for discussing these issuesnare totally obsolete.,One and the same event hasna level of description,where it's neurobiological,nand another level of description,where it's mental,nand that's a single event,,and that's how nature works.nThat's how it's possible,for consciousness to function causally.,Okay, now with that in mind,,with going through these variousnfeatures of consciousness,,let's go back and answernsome of those early objections.,Well, the first one I said was,nconsciousness doesn't exist,,it's an illusion. Well,nI've already answered that.,I don't think we need to worry about that.,But the second one hadnan incredible influence,,and may still be around, and that is,,"Well, if consciousness exists,nit's really something else.,It's really a digital computernprogram running in your brain,and that's what we need to donto create consciousness,is get the right program.,Yeah, forget about the hardware.nAny hardware will do,provided it's rich enough and stablenenough to carry the program.",Now, we know that that's wrong.,I mean, anybody who's thoughtnabout computers at all,can see that that's wrong,nbecause computation,is defined as symbol manipulation,,usually thought of as zerosnas ones, but any symbols will do.,You get an algorithm that you can program,in a binary code,nand that's the defining trait,of the computer program.,But we know that that's purelynsyntactical. That's symbolic.,We know that actual human consciousnessnhas something more than that.,It's got a contentnin addition to the syntax.,It's got a semantics.,Now that argument, I madenthat argument 30 --,oh my God, I don't wantnto think about it —,more than 30 years ago,,but there's a deeper argumentnimplicit in what I've told you,,and I want to tell you that argumentnbriefly, and that is,,consciousness createsnan observer-independent reality.,It creates a reality of money,nproperty, government,,marriage, CERN conferences,,cocktail parties and summer vacations,,and all of those are creationsnof consciousness.,Their existence is observer-relative.,It's only relative to consciousnagents that a piece of paper,is money or that a bunchnof buildings is a university.,Now, ask yourself about computation.,Is that absolute, like force and massnand gravitational attraction?,Or is it observer-relative?,Well, some computations are intrinsic.,I add two plus two to get four.,That's going on no matternwhat anybody thinks.,But when I haul out my pocket calculator,and do the calculation,nthe only intrinsic phenomenon,is the electronic circuitnand its behavior.,That's the only absolute phenomenon.,All the rest is interpreted by us.,Computation only existsnrelative to consciousness.,Either a conscious agentnis carrying out the computation,,or he's got a piece of machinery that admitsnof a computational interpretation.,Now that doesn't meanncomputation is arbitrary.,I spent a lot of money on this hardware.,But we have this persistent confusion,between objectivity and subjectivitynas features of reality,and objectivity and subjectivitynas features of claims.,And the bottom line of thisnpart of my talk is this:,You can have a completelynobjective science,,a science where you makenobjectively true claims,,about a domain whose existencenis subjective,,whose existence is in the human brain,consisting of subjectivenstates of sentience,or feeling or awareness.,So the objection that you can't havenan objective science of consciousness,because it's subjective and sciencenis objective, that's a pun.,That's a bad pun on objectivitynand subjectivity.,You can make objective claims,about a domain that is subjectivenin its mode of existence,,and indeed that's what neurologists do.,I mean, you have patientsnthat actually suffer pains,,and you try to getnan objective science of that.,Okay, I promised to refute all these guys,,and I don't have an awfulnlot of time left,,but let me refute a couple more of them.,I said that behaviorism ought to be,one of the great embarrassmentsnof our intellectual culture,,because it's refutednthe moment you think about it.,Your mental states are identicalnwith your behavior?,Well, think about the distinctionnbetween feeling a pain,and engaging in pain behavior.,I won't demonstrate painnbehavior, but I can tell you,I'm not having any pains right now.,So it's an obvious mistake. Whyndid they make the mistake?,The mistake was — and youncan go back and read,the literature on this, youncan see this over and over —,they think if you acceptnthe irreducible existence,of consciousness, you'rengiving up on science.,You're giving up on 300nyears of human progress,and human hope and all the rest of it.,And the message I wantnto leave you with is,,consciousness has to become accepted,as a genuine biological phenomenon,,as much subject to scientific analysis,as any other phenomenon in biology,,or, for that matter, the rest of science.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm going to be talking about designing humor,,which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes,to some of the discussions about constraints,,and how in certain contexts, humor is right,,and in other contexts it's wrong. 
 Now, I'm from New York,,so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.,Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,,75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.,Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor,except this woman. 
 (Video) Woman: (Laughs) 
 Bob Mankoff: That's my first wife.,(Laughter),That part of the relationship went fine.,(Laughter) 
 Now let's look at this cartoon.,One of the things I'm pointing out is that,cartoons appear within the context,of The New Yorker magazine,,that lovely Caslon type, and it seems,like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.,It's making a little bit fun of getting older,,and, you know, people might like it. 
 But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.,You couldn't satisfy this guy. 
 "Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.,It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,,but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish." 
 (Laughter) 
 The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,,very easy for people to get their nose out of joint.,And one of the things that you realize,is it's an unusual environment.,Here I'm one person talking to you.,You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.,In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,,and when you actually look at that,,and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,,and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor,is really interesting. 
 Let's look at this cartoon. 
 "Discouraging data on the antidepressant." 
 (Laughter) 
 Indeed, it is discouraging.,Now, you would think, well, look,,most of you laughed at that.,Right? You thought it was funny.,In general, that seems like a funny cartoon,,but let's look what online survey I did.,Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.,A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.,But look at the individual responses. 
 "I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.,(Laughter),"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me." 
 This person rated it a two.,"I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons." 
 To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.,Other people thought it was funny.,That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor,when you don't have the contagion of humor. 
 Humor is a type of entertainment.,All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,,something that might happen wrong,,and yet we like it when there's protection.,That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.,The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?,That's a bad zoo.,(Laughter),It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.,But this is a worse one.,(Laughter),So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,,you have to see, where is that tiger going to be?,Where is the danger going to exist?,How are you going to manage it?,My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.,But The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,,and we have 1,000 cartoons.,Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.,Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine,if we removed the articles.,(Laughter),But I feel that would be a huge loss,,one I could live with, but still huge. 
 Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.,The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine,does 10 or 15 ideas every week.,But they mostly are going to be rejected.,That's the nature of any creative activity.,Many of them fade away. Some of them stay. 
 Matt Diffee is one of them.,Here's one of his cartoons.,(Laughter) 
 Drew Dernavich. "Accounting night at the improv.","Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience,to shout out some random numbers." 
 Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel.",(Laughter) 
 Now I know all about rejection,,because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school,and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,,from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,,and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.,At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --,[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] —,magically changed to this.,[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.],(Laughter),Now of course that's not what happened,,but that's the emotional truth.,And of course, that is not New Yorker humor. 
 What is New Yorker humor?,Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.,Finally, in 1980, I received the revered,New Yorker contract,,which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business. 
 From 1980. "Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement,there of -- " blah blah blah blah -- blur --,"for any idea drawings." 
 With respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract,is the word "cartoon" mentioned.,The word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.,So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something,that requires you to think.,Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking,on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part,to make it into a cartoon.,(Laughter) 
 Here are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind. 
 "There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just." 
 This is What Lemmings Believe. 
 (Laughter) 
 The New Yorker and I, when we made comments,,the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.,What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?,No. It's about us.,You know, it's my view basically about religion,,that the real conflict and all the fights between religion,is who has the best imaginary friend.,(Laughter) 
 And this is my most well-known cartoon.,"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?",It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.,It's even on thongs,,but compressed to "How about never — is never good for you?" 
 Now these look like very different forms of humor,but actually they bear a great similarity.,In each instance, our expectations are defied.,In each instance, the narrative gets switched.,There's an incongruity and a contrast.,In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?",what you have is the syntax of politeness,and the message of being rude.,That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy,where we mash up these two things which don't go together,and temporarily in our minds exist.,He is both being polite and rude.,In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker,and the vulgarity of the language.,Basically, that's the way humor works. 
 So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.,Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.,Nobody is much interested, and the frog dies.,Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.,But really, it makes me —,Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,,The Laughing Audience.,There are the people, fops up there,,but everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing,except one guy.,This guy. Who is he? He's the critic.,He's the critic of humor,,and really I'm forced to be in that position,,when I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger,that I will become this guy. 
 Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of,how they imagine if we really exaggerated that. 
 (Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.,Ehhh.,Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.,Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.,I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.,No. Nah. No.,Overdrawn. Underdrawn.,Drawn just right, still not funny enough.,No. No.,For God's sake no, a thousand times no. 
 (Music) 
 No. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later],Hey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there? 
 Office worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No. 
 Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No. 
 Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No. 
 Office worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.,Eh, no.,Office worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.,Office worker: BLT?BM: No. 
 Office worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No. 
 Office worker: Green bean salad?BM: No. 
 (Music) 
 No. No.,Definitely no. [Several hours after lunch] 
 (Siren) 
 No. Get out of here. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do. 
 Now, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,,so many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection.","The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.,And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here,who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.,See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.,It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists. 
 So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor. 
 "I'm thinking about having a child." 
 (Laughter) 
 There you have an interesting -- the guilty laugh,,the laugh against your better judgment. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Ass-head. Please help." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, in fact, within a context of this book,,which says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see,in The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.,I'm going to explain why.,There's a concept about humor about it being,a benign violation.,In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think,it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.,If we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny.",And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?,And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?",It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.,Within that context, we feel it's okay.,So within this context, "Asshead. Please help",is a benign violation. 
 Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...,"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response,help treat cancer?" Oh, goodness.,You're reading about this smart stuff,,this intelligent dissection of the immune system.,You glance over at this, and it says,,"Asshead. Please help"? God.,So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.,There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.,Everything will be within the context and our expectations. 
 One way to look at it is this.,It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,,a theory about motivation and the mood we're in,and how the mood we're in determines the things we like,or dislike.,When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.,We want high arousal. We feel excited then.,If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.,"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.,You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.,You want to be transgressed.,It's like this, like an amusement park. 
 Voice: Here we go. (Screams) 
 He laughs. He is both in danger and safe,,incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.,If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,,they will laugh at very, very little. 
 This is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection.","Too snug?",That's a cartoon about terrorism.,The New Yorker occupies a very different space.,It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,,and in that space, the cartoons are different. 
 Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did,right after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.,How would The New Yorker attack it?,It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?",Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because,actually I thought maybe people would be offended.,The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened,after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,,the suicide bomber is all in little pieces,,and he's saying to the suicide bomber,,"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis." 
 (Laughter) 
 Better left undrawn. 
 The first week we did no cartoons.,That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.,It's not always appropriate every time.,But the next week, this was the first cartoon. 
 "I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket." 
 It basically was about, if we were alive,,we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.,We were going to exist. Here's another one. 
 "I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win." 
 These cartoons are not about them. They're about us.,The humor reflects back on us.,The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,,is a friend makes fun of an enemy.,It's called dispositional humor.,It's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor. 
 Here's another cartoon. 
 "I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state." 
 (Laughter) 
 Humor does need a target.,But interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.,The target is the readership and the people who do it.,The humor is self-reflective,and makes us think about our assumptions.,Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary. 
 "Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,,three years your junior, your age on the dot,,exactly your age." 
 That is a deeply profound cartoon.,And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,,make cartoons say something besides funny,and something about us. Here's another one. 
 "I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,,Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Excuse me — I think there's something wrong with this,in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint." 
 So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,,our foils and our foibles, really not someone else's. 
 The New Yorker demands,some cognitive work on your part,,and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,,who wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship,between humor, art and science,,is what's called bisociation.,You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,,and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.,If the different frames of reference don't come together,in about .5 seconds, it's not funny,,but I think they will for you here.,Different frames of reference. 
 "You slept with her, didn't you?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Lassie! Get help!!" 
 (Laughter) 
 It's called French Army Knife. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is Einstein in bed. "To you it was fast." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.,Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.,How many people know what this cartoon means?,The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.,This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.,That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year,called "I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test.",(Laughter) 
 The other thing The New Yorker plays around with,is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,,is sort of the basis of humor.,Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.,But the way incongruity works is, observational humor,is humor within the realm of reality. 
 "My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?,That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality. 
 Here, cowboy to a cow:,"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you." 
 We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together. 
 Here, in the nonsense range: 
 "Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?" 
 Now that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.,In general, people who enjoy more nonsense,,enjoy more abstract art,,they tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.,But for us, and for me, helping design the humor,,it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.,It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting. 
 So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon,,and I think this sums up the whole thing, really,,about The New Yorker cartoons. 
 "It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it." 
 (Laughter) 
 And now, when you look at New Yorker cartoons,,I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)This is Charley Williams.,He was 94 when this photograph was taken.,In the 1930s, Roosevelt put,thousands and thousands of Americans back to work,by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,,but he also did something interesting,,which was to hire a few hundred writers,to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.,Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,,wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,,but Charley had actually been a slave,until he was 22 years old.,And the stories that were captured of his life,make up one of the crown jewels,of histories, of human-lived experiences,filled with ex-slaves. 
 Anna Deavere Smith famously said that,there's a literature inside of each of us,,and three generations later, I was part of a project,called StoryCorps,,which set out to capture,the stories of ordinary Americans,by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.,The idea is very, very simple.,You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother,or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview,and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.,It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive,one conversation at a time.,And the question is, who do you want to remember --,if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?,What's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,,we always actually talked about this,as a little bit of a subversive project,,because when you think about it,,it's actually not really about the stories that are being told,,it's about listening,,and it's about the questions that you get to ask,,questions that you may not have permission to,on any other day.,I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project. 
 [Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments] 
 Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,,before we had leveled off,,our level-off point was 45,000 feet,,so before we had leveled off,,Pedro began leaving us,,and the beauty about it,is that I believe that there's something after life.,You can see it in Pedro. 
 [Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years] 
 Danny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,,I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,,and I say it so often. I say it to remind you,that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,,it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,,and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house. 
 (Laughter) 
 [Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz] 
 Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,,and we can leave it there.,And he saved up and he purchased this,,and he proposed to my mother with this,,and so I thought that I would give it to you,so that he could be with us for this also.,So I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.,Where's the right finger?,Debora Brakarz: (Crying),MW: Debora, will you please marry me?,DB: Yes. Of course. I love you.,(Kissing),MW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,,in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.,My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.,He used to pick people up here every day.,So it seems right. 
 Jake Barton: So I have to say,I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry,because they all make you cry.,The entire project is predicated on this act of love,which is listening itself.,And that motion of building an institution,out of a moment of conversation and listening,is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,,is doing with our engagements in general.,So we're a media design firm, and we're working,with a broad array of different institutions,building media installations for museums and public spaces. 
 Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,,which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.,And Gallery One is an interesting project,because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion,for the Cleveland Museum of Art,,and we actually brought in this piece,specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,,at the same time that the museum itself is growing. 
 Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,,"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.,Visitors are transient. We want people who live here,,people who have ownership." 
 And so what we're doing is making a broad array,of different ways for people to actually engage,with the material inside of these galleries,,so you can still have a traditional gallery experience,,but if you're interested, you can actually engage,with any individual artwork and see the original context,from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.,So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,,and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.,Or this individual piece here,,you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way,you think about this type of a tempera painting.,This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.,This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense,of this incredible factory for creativity.,And it makes you think about literally the hundreds,or thousands of years of human creativity and how,each individual artwork stands in for part of that story.,This is Picasso,,of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century. 
 And so our next interface, which I'll show you,,actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.,It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse,the actual museum's collection using facial recognition.,So this person's making different faces,,and it's actually drawing forth different objects,from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.,And so you can imagine that, as people are performing,inside of the museum itself, you get this sense,of this emotional connection,,this way in which our face connects with the thousands,and tens of thousands of years.,This is an interface that actually allows you to draw,and then draws forth objects using those same shapes.,So more and more we're trying to find ways,for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,,to be creative even as they're looking,at other people's creativity and understanding them. 
 So in this wall, the collections wall,,you can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,,and you can actually author your own,individual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,,and someone can take a tour with the museum director,or a tour with their little cousin. 
 But all the while that we've been working,on this engagement for Cleveland,,we've also been working in the background,on really our largest engagement to date,,and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. 
 So we started in 2006,as part of a team with Thinc Design,to create the original master plan for the museum,,and then we've done all the media design,both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.,So the memorial opened in 2011,,and the museum's going to open next year in 2014.,And you can see from these images,,the site is so raw and almost archaeological.,And of course the event itself is so recent,,somewhere between history and current events,,it was a huge challenge to imagine,how do you actually live up to a space like this,,an event like this, to actually tell that story. 
 And so what we started with,was really a new way of thinking about building an institution,,through a project called Make History,,which we launched in 2009.,So it's estimated that a third of the world,watched 9/11 live,,and a third of the world,heard about it within 24 hours,,making it really by nature of when it happened,,this unprecedented moment of global awareness.,And so we launched this to capture the stories,from all around the world,,through video, through photos,,through written history,,and so people's experiences on that day,,which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution,to make its first move this open platform.,But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,,really the simplest we've ever made,,where you locate yourself on a map.,It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story,about what happened to you on that day.,And when we started seeing the incredible images,and stories that came forth,from all around the world --,this is obviously part of the landing gear --,we really started to understand,that there was this amazing symmetry,between the event itself,,between the way that people were telling the stories of the event,,and how we ourselves needed to tell that story. 
 This image in particular really captured,our attention at the time,,because it so much sums up that event.,This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.,There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,,and so the firefighters themselves are running,a mile and a half to the site itself,with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.,And we got this amazing email that said,,"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,,I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.,It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,",and he was writing because he said,,"I'd like to personally thank the photographer,for posting the photo,,as it meant more than words can describe to me,to have access to what is probably,the last photo ever taken of my son." 
 And it really made us recognize,what this institution needed to be,in order to actually tell that story.,We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating,objectively in the third person about an event like that,,when you have the witnesses to history,who are going to make their way,through the actual museum itself. 
 And so we started imagining the museum,,along with the creative team at the museum and the curators,,thinking about how the first voice that you would hear,inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.,And so we created this idea of an opening gallery,called We Remember.,And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,,but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter,into that moment in time,and be transported back in history. 
 (Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii.nVoice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt. 
 Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris.nVoice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley. 
 Voice 5: I was in Times Square.nVoice 6: São Paolo, Brazil. 
 (Multiple voices) 
 Voice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night. 
 Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning. 
 Voice 9: We were actually in a meeting,when someone barged in and said,,"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center." 
 Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio. 
 Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio -- 
 Voice 12: Heard it on the radio. 
 (Multiple voices) 
 Voice 13: I got a call from my father.nVoice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.,My business partner told me to turn on the television. 
 Voice 15: So I switched on the television. 
 Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing. 
 Voice 17: The Twin Towers.nVoice 18: The Twin Towers. 
 JB: And you move from there,into that open, cavernous space.,This is the so-called slurry wall.,It's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center,that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River,for a full year after the event itself.,And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,,of presence of that moment,into the actual exhibition itself.,And we tell the stories of being inside the towers,through that same audio collage,,so you're hearing people literally talking about,seeing the planes as they make their way into the building,,or making their way down the stairwells.,And as you make your way into the exhibition,where it talks about the recovery,,we actually project directly onto these moments,of twisted steel all of the experiences from people,who literally excavated on top of the pile itself.,And so you can hear oral histories --,so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades,as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences,from that moment. 
 And as you leave that storytelling moment,understanding about 9/11,,we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening,and actually talk to the individual visitors,and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.,And we ask them questions that are actually,not really answerable, the types of questions,that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.,And so these are questions like,,"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?","How could 9/11 have happened?","And how did the world change after 9/11?" 
 And so these oral histories,,which we've actually been capturing already for years,,are then mixed together with interviews,that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,,Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,,and you mix together these different players,and these different experiences,,these different reflection points about 9/11.,And suddenly the institution, once again,,turns into a listening experience.,So I'll play you just a short excerpt,of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,,but you really get a sense,of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event. 
 (Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience. 
 Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us. 
 Voice 3: And I knew when I saw that,,people who were there that day who immediately,went to help people known and unknown to them,was something that would pull us through. 
 Voice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion,that came from our country was something really,that will forever, ever stay with me. 
 Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those,who lost their lives,,and those who gave their lives to help others,,but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,,the love, the compassIon, the strength,,and I watched a nation come together,in the middle of a terrible tragedy. 
 JB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,,reflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,,they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,,because they've gone back up to grade,,and we actually got involved in the memorial,after we'd done the museum for a few years.,The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,,had this image in his mind of all the names appearing,undifferentiated, almost random,,really a poetic reflection on top of the nature,of a terrorism event itself,,but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,,certainly for the first responders,,and there was a negotiation that went forth,and a solution was found,to actually create not an order in terms of chronology,,or in terms of alphabetical,,but through what's called meaningful adjacency.,So these are groupings of the names themselves,which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,,and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm,to take massive amounts of data,to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.,So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself,with the names scrambled for privacy,,but you can see that these blocks of color,are actually the four different flights,,the two different towers, the first responders,,and you can actually see within that different floors,,and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections,that were requested by the families themselves.,And so when you go to the memorial,,you can actually see the overarching organization,inside of the individual pools themselves.,You can see the way that the geography of the event,is reflected inside of the memorial,,and you can search for an individual name,,or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,,and see the way in which all of those names,,those hundreds of names, are actually organized,onto the memorial itself,,and use that to navigate the memorial.,And more importantly, when you're actually at the site,of the memorial, you can see those connections.,You can see the relationships between the different names themselves.,So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous,group of names springs into reality as an individual life.,In this case, Harry Ramos,,who was the head trader at an investment bank,,who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.,And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,,"I'm not going to leave you.",And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other. 
 Three generations ago, we had to actually get people,to go out and capture the stories for common people.,Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories,for all of us that are being captured for future generations.,And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm almost like a crazy evangelical.,I've always known that the age of design is upon us,,almost like a rapture.,If the day is sunny, I think,,"Oh, the gods have had a good design day.",Or, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,,particularly beautiful, I say,he's so good because he clearly looked to design,to understand what he needed to do. 
 So I really do believe that design,is the highest form of creative expression.,That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,,and the age of design is the age in which design,is still cute furniture, is still posters,,is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.,But in truth, what I really would like to explain,to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that,the most interesting chairs are the ones,that are actually made by a robot,,like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,,where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur,of recycled refrigerator parts,,as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.,Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time,and that become part of our identity.,I want people to understand,that design is so much more than cute chairs,,that it is first and foremost everything that is around us,in our life. 
 And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about,tonight is not simply design but interaction design.,And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying,to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art,for a few years, starting not very timidly,but just pointedly with works, for instance,,by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine,plays chess with itself, that you see here,,or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface,for One Laptop Per Child,,Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,,and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,,and John Maeda's Reactive Books,,and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.,These were some of the first acquisitions that really,introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. 
 But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper,into interaction design with examples,that are emotionally really suggestive,and that really explain interaction design at a level,that is almost undeniable.,The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,,I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.,It looks at the territory of the United States,as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds,and that is really giving you a pictorial image,of what's going on with the winds in the United States. 
 But also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,,and that's where all hell broke loose,in a really interesting way. (Laughter),There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.,And that's really what I find so intriguing,about the reactions that we've had to the anointment,of video games in the MoMA collection.,We've -- No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.,I love them. So we are in the right quadrant.,We are in the Highbrow -- that's daring, that's courageous --,and Brilliant, which is great.,Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,,but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter) 
 But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic. 
 So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.,"Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art.",Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.,"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" --,They're two floors away. (Laughter) —,"will mean game over for any real understanding of art.",I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?,We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.,And Jonathan Jones is making it happen. 
 So the same Guardian rebuts,,"Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be.,Last week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested,that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?,And does it matter?" Thank you. Does it matter? 
 You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem,of design being often misunderstood for art,,or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to,aspire to, would like to be called, artists.,No. Designers aspire to be really great designers.,Thank you very much. And that's more than enough. 
 So my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,,without any prompt, came out with this big declaration,on why video games belong in the MoMA.,And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it. 
 But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article,that came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,,by Liel Leibovitz, and it said, "MoMA has mistaken video games for art." Again.,"The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso." Again.,"That misses the point.",Excuse me. You're missing the point.,And here, look, the above question is put bluntly:,"Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art,because they are quite thoroughly something else: code.",Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right? 
 So it's so fantastic to see,how these feathers that were ruffled,,and these reactions, were so vehement.,And you know what?,The International Cat Video Film Festival,didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter),I think this was truly fantastic.,We were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous,of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,,because it's very, very wonderful.,And there's this Flaubert quote that I love:,"I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,,but a tide of shit is beating at its walls,,threatening to undermine it.",I consider myself the tide of shit. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 You know, we have to go through that.,Even in the 1930s, my colleagues,that were trying to put together an abstract art show,had all of these works stopped by the customs officers,that decided they were not art.,So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,,but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud,to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.,And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.,And you know, the amount of work --,yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government,and that's how he developed Tetris,,and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game,and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube,that makes it look slightly bombed.,And it's fantastic. 
 So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,,because we're still the Museum of Modern Art,,so even when we tackle popular culture,,we tackle it as a form of interaction design,and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,,therefore, has to be researched.,So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's,wonderful Another World, amongst others,,we put together a panel of experts,,and we worked on this acquisition,,and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.,We worked on it for a year and a half.,So many people helped us — designers of games,,you might know Jamin Warren,and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,,and you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.,We bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.,We were not real gamers enough,,so we had to really talk to them.,And so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,,not the other Sim City, that one in particular,,so the criteria that we developed along the way,were really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.,They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.,That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game,or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve,and show artifacts that will more and more,become part of our lives in the future.,We live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,,not in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone,that our mind makes of the two. 
 And that's really where interaction lies,,and that's the importance of interaction.,And in order to explain interaction, we need to really,bring people in and make them realize,how interaction is part of their lives.,So when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,,which are in a way the purest form of interaction,,unadulterated by any kind of function or finality.,I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,,which I consider a masterpiece of interaction.,I mean, that interface is beautiful.,It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.,You know, with your mitt you can actually paw,the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad,ATM machines usually are.,So I let people understand that it's up to them,to know how to judge interaction,so as to know when it's good or when it's bad.,So when I show The Sims,,I try to make people really feel what it meant,to have an interaction with The Sims,,not only the fun but also the responsibility,that came with the Tamagotchi. 
 You know, video games can be truly deep,even when they're completely mindless.,I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.,It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can,in a finite amount of time,and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.,I've never made it into a planet, but that's it.,Or, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.,It was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.,And it was one of the first video games,in which you could choose your own music.,So you would put into the PlayStation,,you would put your own CD,,and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic. 
 Not to mention Eve Online.,Eve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,,but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,,not Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,,was a really big shot in Eve Online,,so here you have a diplomat in the real world,that spends his time in Eve Online,to kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy,and about universe-building, and to the point that,the first announcement of the bombing,was actually given on Eve Online,,and after his death, several parts of the universe,were named after him.,And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival,in Reykjavík that was quite amazing.,I mean, we're talking about an experience,that of course can seem weird to many,,but that is very educational.,Of course, there are games that are even more educational. 
 Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail,of this kind of massive multiplayer online game,,and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,,and they were greeted,by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.,It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.,So you start seeing here that,the aesthetics that are so important,to a museum collection like MoMA's,are kept alive also by the selection of these games. 
 And you know, Valve -- you know, Portal --,is an example of a video game in which,you have a certain type of violence,which also leads me to talk about,one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss,when we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.,Right? We had to make decisions.,At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence,depicted in the art part of the collection,,but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,,I said, "You know what, we need a Beretta.",And I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection.",And I was like, "Why?",Interestingly, I learned that it's considered,that in design and in the design collection,,what you see is what you get.,So when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.,If it's in the art collection,,it might be a critique of the killing instrument.,So it's very interesting.,But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,,so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.,But here, in this particular case, we decided,,you know, with Kate and Paul,,that we would have no gratuitous violence.,So we have Portal because you shoot walls,in order to create new spaces.,We have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.,(Laughter),But we don't have GTA because,,maybe it's my own reflection,,I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars,and shooting prostitutes and pimps.,So it was not very constructive. (Laughter),So, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this,for so many days. You have no idea.,And to this day, I am ambivalent,,but when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.,It's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.,It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.,Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones.,So it's quite a hefty collection. 
 And right now, we started with the first 14,,but we have several that are coming up,,and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet,is because you don't acquire just the game.,You acquire the relationship with the company.,What we want, what we aspire to, is the code.,It's very hard to get, of course.,But that's what would enable us to preserve,the video games for a really long time,,and that's what museums do.,They also preserve artifacts for posterity.,In absence of the code, because, you know,,video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,,in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.,We're going to stay with them forever.,They're not going to get rid of us.,And one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter) 
 But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose,for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.,And I'm showing you Core War here,,which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically,of the limitations of the processor.,So the kind of interferences that you see here,that look like beautiful barriers in the game,are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,,which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. 
 And so is space, the spatial aspect of games.,You know, I feel that the best video games,are the ones that have really savvy architects,that are behind them, and if they're not architects,,bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.,But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. 
 Time. The way we experience time in video games,,as in other forms of interaction design,,is really quite amazing.,It can be real time or it can be the time within the game,,as is in Animal Crossing, where seasons,follow each other at their own pace. 
 So time, space, aesthetics,,and then, most important, behavior.,The real core issue of interaction design is behavior.,Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors,that go to influence the rest of our lives.,They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.,In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,,which is a beautiful game,in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,,so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,,and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.,In a way, you can see how video games,are the purest aspect of interaction design,and are very useful to explain what interaction is. 
 We don't want to show the video games,with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.,If anything, we want to show the code,,and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,,of the Pac-Man code. 
 So the way we acquired the games is very interesting,and very unorthodox. You see them here,displayed alongside other examples of design,,furniture and other parts,,but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,,only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.,The controllers are, of course, part of the experience,,so you cannot do away with it.,But interestingly, this choice was not condemned,too vehemently by gamers.,I was afraid that they would kill us,,and instead they understood, especially,when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem,that Philip Johnson applied in 1934,when he wanted to make people understand,the importance of design, and he took propeller blades,and pieces of machinery and,in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals,against white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.,He created this strange distance, this shock,,that made people realize how gorgeous formally,,and also important functionally, design pieces were.,I would like to do the same with video games.,By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts,and everything else that we might remember from our childhood,,I want people to understand,that those are important forms of design.,And in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else,lead us to make people understand,a wider meaning for design. 
 One of my dream acquisitions,,which has been on hold for a few years,but now will come back on the front burner,,is a 747.,I would like to acquire it, but without owning it.,I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.,I want it to keep flying.,So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement,with an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying. 
 And the same with the "@" sign that we acquired a few years ago.,It was the first example of an acquisition of something,that is in the public domain.,And what I say to people, it's almost as if,a butterfly were flying by,and we captured the shadow on the wall,,and just we're showing the shadow.,So in a way, we're showing a manifestation,of something that is truly important,and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.,And it's too long to explain the acquisition,,but if you want to go on the MoMA blog,,there's a long post where I explain why,it's such a great example of design. 
 Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?,I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.,But I see that people are coming along,,that the audiences, paradoxically,,are much more responsive and much more understanding,of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.,Design is truly everywhere,,and design is as important as anything,,and I'm so glad that, because of its diversity,and because of its centrality to our lives,,many more people are coming to it,as a profession, as a passion,,and as, very simply, part of their own culture. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Hello.,I'm a toy developer.,With a dream of creating new toysnthat have never been seen before,,I began working at a toy companynnine years ago.,When I first started working there,,I proposed many new ideasnto my boss every day.,However, my boss always asked,if I had the data to prove it would sell,,and asked me to think of productndevelopment after analyzing market data.,Data, data, data. 
 So I analyzed the market datanbefore thinking of a product.,However, I was unable to thinknof anything new at that moment.,(Laughter),My ideas were unoriginal.,I wasn't getting any new ideasnand I grew tired of thinking.,It was so hard that I became this skinny.,(Laughter),It's true.n(Applause) 
 You've all probably hadnsimilar experiences and felt this way too.,Your boss was being difficult.nThe data was difficult.,You become sick of thinking.,Now, I throw out the data.,It's my dream to create new toys.,And now, instead of data,,I'm using a game called Shiritorinto come up with new ideas. 
 I would like to introducenthis method today.,What is Shiritori?,Take apple, elephant nand trumpet, for example.,It's a game where nyou take turns saying words,that start with the last letternof the previous word.,It's the same in Japanese and English.,You can play Shiritori as you like:,"neko, kora, raibu, burashi," etc, etc.n[Cat, cola, concert, brush],Many random words will come out.,You force those words to connect to whatnyou want to think of and form ideas.,In my case, for example,nsince I want to think of toys,,what could a toy cat be?,A cat that lands after doingna somersault from a high place?,How about a toy with cola?,A toy gun where you shoot colanand get someone soaking wet?,(Laughter) 
 Ridiculous ideas are okay.nThe key is to keep them flowing.,The more ideas you produce, you're surento come up with some good ones, too.,A brush, for example.nCan we make a toothbrush into a toy?,We could combinena toothbrush with a guitar and --,(Music noises) --,you've got a toy you can play withnwhile brushing your teeth.,(Laughter) (Applause),Kids who don't like to brushntheir teeth might begin to like it. 
 Can we make a hat into a toy?,How about something like a roulette game,nwhere you try the hat on one by one,,and then, when someone puts it on,na scary alien breaks through the top,screaming, "Ahh!",I wonder if there would bena demand for this at parties? 
 Ideas that didn't come out while you starenat the data will start to come out.,Actually, this bubble wrap,nwhich is used to pack fragile objects,,combined with a toy,nmade Mugen Pop Pop,,a toy where you can popnthe bubbles as much as you like.,It was a big hit when it reached stores.,Data had nothing to do with its success.,Although it's only popping bubbles,,it's a great way to kill time,,so please pass this around,amongst yourselves today and play with it.,(Applause) 
 Anyway, you continue to come up withnuseless ideas.,Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.,If you base your ideas on data analysisnand know what you're aiming for,,you'll end up trying too hard,,and you can't produce new ideas.,Even if you know what your aim is,,think of ideas as freely as if you werenthrowing darts with your eyes closed.,If you do this, you surely will hitnsomewhere near the center.,At least one will.,That's the one you should choose.,If you do so, that idea will be in demand,and, moreover, it will be brand new.,That is how I think of new ideas. 
 It doesn't have to be Shiritori;nthere are many different methods.,You just have to choose words at random.,You can flip through a dictionarynand choose words at random.,For example, you could look up twonrandom letters and gather the results,or go to the storenand connect product names,with what you want to think of.,The point is to gather random words,,not information from the categorynyou're thinking for.,If you do this, the ingredients fornthe association of ideas are collected,and form connectionsnthat will produce many ideas.,The greatest advantage to this methodnis the continuous flow of images.,Because you're thinkingnof one word after another,,the image of the previous wordnis still with you.,That image will automaticallynbe related with future words.,Unconsciously, a concert willnbe connected to a brush,and a roulette gamenwill be connected to a hat.,You wouldn't even realize it.,You can come up with ideas thatnyou wouldn't have thought of otherwise. 
 This method is, of course,nnot just for toys.,You can collect ideas for books, apps,nevents, and many other projects.,I hope you all try this method.,There are futures that are born from data.,However, using this silly gamencalled Shiritori,,I look forward tonthe exciting future you will create,,a future you couldn't even imagine. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Almost two years ago,,I was driving in my car in Germany,,and I turned on the radio.,Europe at the time was in the middle,of the Euro crisis,,and all the headlines were about European countries,getting downgraded by rating agencies,in the United States.,I listened and thought to myself,,"What are these rating agencies,,and why is everybody so upset about their work?" 
 Well, if you were sitting,next to me in the car that day,and would have told me that I would devote,the next years to trying to reform them,,obviously I would have called you crazy.,But guess what's really crazy:,the way these rating agencies are run.,And I would like to explain to you,not only why it's time to change this,,but also how we can do it. 
 So let me tell you a little bit,about what rating agencies really do.,As you would read a car magazine,before purchasing a new car,or taking a look at a product review,before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,,investors are reading ratings,before they decide in which kind of product,they are investing their money.,A rating can range from a so-called AAA,,which means it's a top-performing product,,and it can go down to the level,of the so-called BBB-,,which means it's a fairly risky investment.,Rating agencies are rating companies.,They are rating banks.,They are rating even financial products,like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.,But they can also rate countries,,and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,,and I would like to focus in particular,on these sovereign ratings. 
 And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,,you're thinking,,so why should I really care about this, right?,Be honest.,Well, ratings affect you.,They affect all of us.,If a rating agency rates a country,,it basically assesses and evaluates,a country's debt,and the ability and willingness of a country,to repay its debt.,So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,,the country has to pay more,in order to borrow money,on the international markets.,So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,,because you and your fellow countrymen,have to pony up more in order to borrow.,But what if a country can't afford to pay more,because it's maybe too expensive?,Well, then the country has less available,for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.,And this is the reason why you should care,,because sovereign ratings affect everyone.,And that is the reason why I believe,they should be defined as public goods.,They should be transparent, accessible,,and available to everyone at no cost. 
 But here's the situation:,the rating agency market is dominated,by three players and three players only --,Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --,and we know whenever therenis a market concentration,,there is really no competition.,There is no incentive to improve,the quality of your product.,And let's face it, the credit rating nagencies have contributed,,putting the global economy on the brink,,and yet they have to change the way they operate. 
 The second point,,would you really buy a car,just based on the advice of the dealer?,Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.,But that's actually what's going on,in the rating agency sector every single day.,The customers of these rating agencies,,like countries or companies,,they are paying for their own ratings,,and obviously this is creating,a conflict of interest. 
 The third point is,,the rating agencies are not really telling us,how they are coming up with their ratings,,but in this day and age,,you can't even sell a candy bar,without listing everything that's inside.,But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,,we really do not know,what all the different ingredients are.,We are allowing the rating agencies,to be intransparent about their work,,and we need to change this. 
 I think there is no doubt that the sector,needs a complete overhaul,,not just a trimming at the margins.,I think it's time for a bold move.,I think it's time to upgrade the system.,And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation,have invested a lot of time and effort,thinking about an alternative for the sector.,And we have developed the first model,for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,,and we call it by its acronym, INCRA. 
 INCRA would make a difference,to the current system,by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.,It would be based on a nonprofit model,that would be based on a sustainable endowment.,The endowment would create income,that would allow us to run the operation,,to run the rating agency,,and it would also allow us,to make our ratings publicly available.,But this is not enough to make a difference, right?,INCRA would also be based on,a very, very clear governance structure,that would avoid any conflict of interest,,and it would include many stakeholders from society.,INCRA would not only be a European,or an American rating agency,,it would be a truly international one,,in which, in particular, the emerging economies,would have an equal interest, nvoice and representation. 
 The second big difference that INCRA would make is,that would it base its sovereign risk assessment,on a broader set of indicators.,Think about it that way.,If we conduct a sovereign rating,,we basically take a look at,the economic soil of a country,,its macroeconomic fundamentals.,But we also have to ask the question,,who is cultivating the economic soil,of a country, right?,Well, a country has many gardeners,,and one of them is the government,,so we have to ask the question,,how is a country governed?,How is it managed?,And this is the reason why we have developed,what we call forward-looking indicators.,These are indicators that give you,a much better read about,the socioeconomic development of a country.,I hope you would agree it's important for you to know,if your government is willing to invest nin renewable energy and education.,It's important for you to know,if the government of your country,is able to manage a crisis,,if the government is finally able to implement,the reforms that it's promised.,For example, if INCRA would rate,South Africa right now,,of course we would take a very, very close look,at the youth unemployment of the country,,the highest in the world.,If over 70 percent of a country's population,under the age of 35 is unemployed,,of course this has a huge impact on the economy,today and even more so in the future.,Well, our friends at Moody's,,Standard & Poor's, and Fitch will tell us,we would take this into account as well.,But guess what? We do not know,exactly how they will take this into account. 
 And this leads me to the third big difference,that INCRA would make.,INCRA would not only release its ratings,but it would also release its indicators,and methodology. 
 So in contrast to the current system,,INCRA would be fully transparent.,So in a nutshell,,INCRA would offer an alternative,to the current system ofnthe big three rating agencies,by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix,that would increase the competition,,it would increase the transparency of the sector,,and it would also increase the quality. 
 I can tell that sovereign ratings,may still look to you like this very small piece,of this very complex global financial world,,but I tell you it's a very important one,,and a very important one to fix,,because sovereign ratings affect all of us,,and they should be addressed and should be defined,as public goods.,And this is why we are testing our model right now,,and why we are trying to find out if it can,bring together a group of able and willing actors,to bring INCRA to life.,I truly believe building up INCRA,is in everyone's interest,,and that we have the unique opportunity right now,to turn INCRA into a cornerstone,of a new, more inclusive financial system.,Because for way too long,,we have left the big financial players on their own.,It's time to give them some company. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This back here was my brain cancer.,Isn't it nice?,(Laughter),The key phrase is "was,",phew.,(Applause) 
 Having brain cancer was really,nas you can imagine,,shocking news for me.,I knew nothing about cancer.,In Western cultures, when you have cancer,,it's as if you disappear in a way.,Your life as a complex human beingnis replaced by medical data:,Your images, your exams, your lab values,,a list of medicines.,And everyone changes as well.,You suddenly become a disease on legs.,Doctors start speaking a languagenwhich you don't understand.,They start pointing their fingers,at your body and your images.,People start changing as well,because they start dealingnwith the disease,,instead of with the human being.,They say, "What did the doctor say?",before even saying, "Hello." 
 And in the meanwhile,,you're left with questionsnto which nobody gives an answer.,These are the "Can I?" questions:,Can I work while I have cancer?,Can I study? Can I make love?nCan I be creative?,And you wonder, "What have I donento deserve this?",You wonder, "Can I change somethingnabout my lifestyle?",You wonder, "Can I do something?,Are there any other options?" 
 And, obviously, doctors arenthe good guys in all these scenarios,,because they are very professionalnand dedicated to curing you.,But they also are very usednto having to deal with patients,,so I'd say that they sometimesnlose the idea that this is torture for you,and that you become,nliterally, a patient --,"patient" means "the one who waits.",(Laughter),Things are changing, but classically,,they tend to not engage you in any waynto learn about your condition,,to get your friends and family engaged,,or showing you waysnin which you can change your lifestyle,to minimize the risksnof what you're going through.,But instead, you're forced there to wait,in the hands of a seriesnof very professional strangers. 
 While I was in the hospital,,I asked for a printed-outnpicture of my cancer,and I spoke with it.,It was really hard to obtain,,because it's not common practicento ask for a picture of your own cancer.,I talked to it and I said,,"Okay, cancer,nyou're not all there is to me.,There's more to me.,A cure, whichever it is, will havento deal with the whole of me.",And so, the next day, I left the hospitalnagainst medical advice.,I was determined to changenmy relationship with the cancer,and I was determinednto learn more about my cancer,before doing anythingnas drastic as a surgery. 
 I'm an artist, I use several formsnof open-source technologies,and open information in my practice.,So my best bet was to get it allnout there, get the information out there,,and use it so that it could benaccessed by anyone.,So I created a website,nwhich is called La Cura,,on which I put my medical data, online.,I actually had to hack it,and that's a thing which wencan talk about in another speech.,(Laughter),I chose this word, La Cura --,La Cura in Italian means "the cure" --,because in many different cultures,,the word "cure" can meannmany different things.,In our Western cultures,,it means eradicatingnor reversing a disease,,but in different cultures,,for example, a culture from Asia,,from the Mediterranean,nfrom Latin countries, from Africa,,it can mean many more things. 
 Of course, I was interestednin the opinions of doctors,and healthcare providers,,but I was also interested innthe cure of the artist, of the poet,,of the designer,,of, who knows, the musicians.,I was interested in the social cure,,I was interested innthe psychological cure,,I was interested in the spiritual cure,,I was interested in the emotional cure,,I was interested in any form of cure. 
 And, it worked.,The La Cura website went viral.,I received lots of media attentionnfrom Italy and from abroad,and I quickly receivednmore than 500,000 contacts --,emails, social networking --,most of them were a suggestionnon how to cure my cancer,,but more of them were aboutnhow to cure myself,as a full individual.,For example, many thousands of videos,,images, pictures, art performances,were produced for La Cura.,For example, here we seenFrancesca Fini in her performance.,Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:,He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor,and put it on sale on Thingiverse.,Now you can have my cancer, too!,(Laughter),Which is a nice thing,nif you think about it,,we can share our cancer. 
 And this was going on --,scientists, the traditionalnmedicine experts,,several researchers, doctors --,all connected with me to give advice.,With all this information and support,,I was able to form a teamnof several neurosurgeons,,traditional doctors,,oncologists, and severalnhundred volunteers,with whom I was able to discuss,the information I was receiving,nwhich is very important.,And together, we were able to formna strategy for my own cure,in many languages,naccording to many cultures.,And the current strategynspans the whole world,and thousands of years of human history,,which is quite remarkable for me.,[Surgery] 
 The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily,nlittle to no growth of the cancer.,So I was able to take my time and choose.,I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,,I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,,and in the meanwhile, I was supportednby thousands of people,,none of whom felt pity for me.,Everyone felt like they couldntake an active role,in helping me to get well,,and this was the most importantnpart of La Cura. 
 What are the outcomes?,I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.,(Applause),I had excellent news,after the surgery --,I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,,which is a "good" kind of cancernwhich doesn't grow a lot.,I have completely changednmy life and my lifestyle.,Everything I did was thoughtfullyndesigned to get me engaged. 
 Up until the very last fewnminutes of the surgery,,which was very intense,,a matrix of electrodesnwas implanted in my brain,from this side,,to be able to build a functional mapnof what the brain controls.,And right before the operation,,we were able to discussnthe functional map of my brain,with the doctor, to understandnwhich risks I was running into,and if there were any I wanted to avoid.,Obviously, there were.,[Open] 
 And this openness was reallynthe fundamental part of La Cura.,Thousands of people sharedntheir stories, their experiences.,Doctors got to talk with peoplenthey don't usually consult,when they think about cancer.,I'm a self-founding,ncontinuous state of translation,among many different languages,,in which science meets emotion,and conventional researchnmeets traditional research.,[Society] 
 The most important thing of La Cura,was to feel like a partnof a really engaged and connected society,whose wellness really dependsnon the wellness of all of its components.,This global performancenis my open-source cure for cancer.,And from what I feel,,it's a cure for me, but for us all. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause).What do we know about the future?,Difficult question,nsimple answer: nothing.,We cannot predict the future.,We only can create a visionnof the future, how it might be,,a vision which reveals disruptivenideas, which is inspiring,,and this is the most important reason,which breaks the chainsnof common thinking.,There are a lot of people,who created their own visionnabout the future,,for instance, this vision herenfrom the early 20th century.,It says here that thisnis the ocean plane of the future.,It takes only one and a half daysnto cross the Atlantic Ocean.,Today, we know that this futurenvision didn't come true.,So this is our largestnairplane which we have,,the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,,so a lot of people fit in there,and it's technically completely different,than the vision I've shown to you.,I'm working in a team with Airbus,,and we have created our vision,about a more sustainablenfuture of aviation.,So sustainability is quitenimportant for us,,which should incorporate social,but as well as environmentalnand economic values.,So we have created a veryndisruptive structure,which mimics the designnof bone, or a skeleton,,which occurs in nature.,So that's why it looksnmaybe a little bit weird,,especially to the people who dealnwith structures in general.,But at least it's just a kind of artwork,to explore our ideasnabout a different future.,What are the main customers of the future?,So, we have the old, we have the young,,we have the uprising power of women,,and there's one mega-trendnwhich affects all of us.,These are the future anthropometrics.,So our children are gettingnlarger, but at the same time,we are growing into different directions.,So what we need is spaceninside the aircraft,,inside a very dense area.,These people have different needs.,So we see a clear neednof active health promotion,,especially in the case of the old people.,We want to be treated as individuals.,We like to be productiventhroughout the entire travel chain,,and what we are doing in the future is,we want to use the latestnman-machine interface,,and we want to integrate thisnand show this in one product.,So we combined these needsnwith technology's themes.,So for instance, we are asking ourselves,,how can we create more light?,How can we bring more naturalnlight into the airplane?,So this airplane has nonwindows anymore, for example.,What about the datanand communication software,which we need in the future?,My belief is that the airplanenof the future,will get its own consciousness.,It will be more like a living organism,than just a collectionnof very complex technology.,This will be very different in the future.,It will communicate directly,with the passenger in its environment.,And then we are talkingnalso about materials,,synthetic biology, for example.,And my belief is that we will getnmore and more,new materials which we cannput into structure later on,,because structure is one of the keynissues in aircraft design.,So let's compare the oldnworld with the new world.,I just want to show you herenwhat we are doing today.,So this is a bracket of an A380ncrew rest compartment.,It takes a lot of weight,,and it follows the classical design rules.,This here is an equal bracketnfor the same purpose.,It follows the design of bone.,The design processnis completely different.,At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,,and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.,So this technology, 3Dnprinting, and new design rules,really help us to reduce the weight,,which is the biggest issuenin aircraft design,,because it's directly linkednto greenhouse gas emissions.,Push this idea a little bit forward.,So how does nature build itsncomponents and structures?,So nature is very clever.nIt puts all the information,into these small buildingnblocks, which we call DNA.,And nature builds largenskeletons out of it.,So we see a bottom-up approach here,,because all the information,nas I said, are inside the DNA.,And this is combinednwith a top-down approach,,because what we are doingnin our daily life,is we train our muscles,nwe train our skeleton,,and it's getting stronger.,And the same approach can benapplied to technology as well.,So our building block is carbonnnanotubes, for example,,to create a large, rivet-lessnskeleton at the end of the day.,How this looks in particular,nyou can show it here.,So imagine you havencarbon nanotubes growing,inside a 3D printer,,and they are embeddedninside a matrix of plastic,,and follow the forcesnwhich occur in your component.,And you've got trillions of them.,So you really align them to wood,,and you take this wood and makenmorphological optimization,,so you make structures, sub-structures,,which allows you to transmitnelectrical energy or data.,And now we take thisnmaterial, combine this,with a top-down approach,,and build bigger and bigger components.,So how might the airplanenof the future look?,So we have very differentnseats which adapt,to the shape of the future passenger,,with the different anthropometrics.,We have social areas inside the aircraft,which might turn into a place,where you can play virtual golf.,And finally, this bionic structure,,which is covered by a transparent,biopolymer membrane,nwill really change radically,how we look at aircrafts in the future.,So as Jason Silva said,,if we can imagine it, why not make it so?,See you in the future. Thank you.,(Applause)The human voice:,It's the instrument we all play.,It's the most powerful soundnin the world, probably.,It's the only one that can start a warnor say "I love you.",And yet many people have the experience,that when they speak, peoplendon't listen to them.,And why is that?,How can we speak powerfullynto make change in the world? 
 What I'd like to suggest,,there are a number of habitsnthat we need to move away from.,I've assembled for your pleasure herenseven deadly sins of speaking.,I'm not pretendingnthis is an exhaustive list,,but these seven, I think, are pretty largenhabits that we can all fall into. 
 First, gossip.,Speaking ill of somebodynwho's not present.,Not a nice habit,nand we know perfectly well,the person gossiping, five minutes later,nwill be gossiping about us. 
 Second, judging.,We know people who are like thisnin conversation,,and it's very hard to listen to somebody,if you know that you're being judgednand found wanting at the same time. 
 Third, negativity.,You can fall into this.,My mother, in the last years of her life,nbecame very negative,,and it's hard to listen.,I remember one day, I said to her,n"It's October 1 today,",and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?" 
 (Laughter) 
 It's hard to listennwhen somebody's that negative. 
 (Laughter) 
 And another formnof negativity, complaining.,Well, this is the national art of the U.K.,It's our national sport.,We complain about the weather, sport,nabout politics, about everything,,but actually, complaining is viral misery.,It's not spreading sunshinenand lightness in the world. 
 Excuses. 
 We've all met this guy.,Maybe we've all been this guy.,Some people have a blamethrower.,They just pass it on to everybody else,and don't take responsibilitynfor their actions,,and again, hard to listennto somebody who is being like that. 
 Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,,embroidery, exaggeration.,It demeans our language,nactually, sometimes.,For example, if I see somethingnthat really is awesome,,what do I call it? 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, of course,nthis exaggeration becomes lying,,and we don't want to listennto people we know are lying to us. 
 And finally, dogmatism.,The confusion of facts with opinions.,When those two things get conflated,,you're listening into the wind.,You know, somebody is bombarding younwith their opinions as if they were true.,It's difficult to listen to that. 
 So here they are, seven deadlynsins of speaking.,These are things I think we need to avoid.,But is there a positivenway to think about this?,Yes, there is.,I'd like to suggest that there are fournreally powerful cornerstones, foundations,,that we can stand on if we want our speech,to be powerful and to makenchange in the world.,Fortunately, these things spell a word.,The word is "hail," and it hasna great definition as well.,I'm not talking about the stuffnthat falls from the sky,and hits you on the head.,I'm talking about this definition,,to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,,which is how I thinknour words will be received,if we stand on these four things. 
 So what do they stand for?,See if you can guess.,The H, honesty, of course,,being true in what you say,nbeing straight and clear.,The A is authenticity,njust being yourself.,A friend of mine described it asnstanding in your own truth,,which I think is a lovely way to put it.,The I is integrity, being your word,,actually doing what you say,,and being somebody people can trust.,And the L is love.,I don't mean romantic love,,but I do mean wishing peoplenwell, for two reasons.,First of all, I think absolute honestynmay not be what we want.,I mean, my goodness,nyou look ugly this morning.,Perhaps that's not necessary.,Tempered with love, of course,nhonesty is a great thing.,But also, if you're reallynwishing somebody well,,it's very hard to judgenthem at the same time.,I'm not even sure you can donthose two things simultaneously.,So hail. 
 Also, now that's what you say,,and it's like the old song,nit is what you say,,it's also the way that you say it.,You have an amazing toolbox.,This instrument is incredible,,and yet this is a toolboxnthat very few people have ever opened.,I'd like to have a little rummagenin there with you now,and just pull a few tools out,that you might like to takenaway and play with,,which will increasenthe power of your speaking. 
 Register, for example.,Now, falsetto register may notnbe very useful most of the time,,but there's a register in between.,I'm not going to get veryntechnical about this,for any of you who are voice coaches.,You can locate your voice, however.,So if I talk up here in my nose,nyou can hear the difference.,If I go down here in my throat,,which is where most of usnspeak from most of the time.,But if you want weight,,you need to go down here to the chest.,You hear the difference?,We vote for politiciansnwith lower voices, it's true,,because we associate depth with power,and with authority.,That's register. 
 Then we have timbre.,It's the way your voice feels.,Again, the research shows,that we prefer voicesnwhich are rich, smooth, warm,,like hot chocolate.,Well if that's not you,nthat's not the end of the world,,because you can train.,Go and get a voice coach.,And there are amazing things you can do,with breathing, with posture,nand with exercises,to improve the timbre of your voice. 
 Then prosody. I love prosody.,This is the sing-song, the meta-language,that we use in order to impart meaning.,It's root one for meaning in conversation.,People who speak all on one notenare really quite hard to listen to,if they don't have any prosody at all.,That's where the wordn"monotonic" comes from,,or monotonous, monotone.,Also, we have repetitivenprosody now coming in,,where every sentence endsnas if it were a question,when it's actually notna question, it's a statement? 
 (Laughter) 
 And if you repeat that one,,it's actually restricting your abilitynto communicate through prosody,,which I think is a shame,,so let's try and break that habit. 
 Pace. 
 I can get very excited by sayingnsomething really quickly,,or I can slow right down to emphasize,,and at the end of that, of course,nis our old friend silence.,There's nothing wrong with a bitnof silence in a talk, is there?,We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.,It can be very powerful. 
 Of course, pitch oftenngoes along with pace,to indicate arousal, but youncan do it just with pitch.,Where did you leave my keys?,(Higher pitch) Where did younleave my keys?,So, slightly different meaningnin those two deliveries. 
 And finally, volume.,(Loud) I can get really excitednby using volume.,Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.,Or, I can have you really pay attentionnby getting very quiet.,Some people broadcast the whole time.,Try not to do that.,That's called sodcasting, 
 (Laughter) 
 Imposing your sound on people around youncarelessly and inconsiderately.,Not nice. 
 Of course, where this all comesninto play most of all,is when you've got somethingnreally important to do.,It might be standing on a stage like thisnand giving a talk to people.,It might be proposing marriage,,asking for a raise, a wedding speech.,Whatever it is, if it's really important,,you owe it to yourselfnto look at this toolbox,and the engine that it's going to work on,,and no engine works wellnwithout being warmed up.,Warm up your voice. 
 Actually, let me show you how to do that.,Would you all like to standnup for a moment?,I'm going to show you,the six vocal warm-up exercisesnthat I do before every talk I ever do.,Any time you're going to talknto anybody important, do these.,First, arms up, deep breath in,,and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.,One more time.,Ahhhh, very good.,Now we're going to warm up our lips,,and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,,Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.,And now, brrrrrrrrrr,,just like when you were a kid.,Brrrr. Now your lipsnshould be coming alive.,We're going to do the tongue next,with exaggerated la, la, la,nla, la, la, la, la, la.,Beautiful. You're gettingnreally good at this.,And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.,That's like champagne for the tongue.,Finally, and if I can only do one,,the pros call this the siren.,It's really good. It startsnwith "we" and goes to "aw.",The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.,So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. 
 Fantastic. Give yourselvesna round of applause.,Take a seat, thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Next time you speak, do those in advance. 
 Now let me just put thisnin context to close.,This is a serious point here.,This is where we are now, right?,We speak not very well,to people who simply aren't listening,in an environment that's allnabout noise and bad acoustics.,I have talked about that on this stagenin different phases.,What would the world be like,if we were speaking powerfully,to people who were listening consciously,in environments which werenactually fit for purpose?,Or to make that a bit larger,,what would the world be like,if we were creating sound consciously,and consuming sound consciously,and designing all our environments,consciously for sound?,That would be a worldnthat does sound beautiful,,and one where understandingnwould be the norm,,and that is an idea worth spreading. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So yesterday, I was out in the street,in front of this building,,and I was walking down the sidewalk,,and I had company, several of us,,and we were all abiding by the rules,of walking down sidewalks.,We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.,We're moving.,When the person in front of me slows down.,And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,,and finally he stops.,Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,,so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,,and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,,and he was doing this.,He was texting,,and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.,Now we could approach this,from a working memory perspective,or from a multitasking perspective.,We're going to do working memory today. 
 Now, working memory,is that part of our consciousness that we are,aware of at any given time of day.,You're going it right now.,It's not something we can turn off.,If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?,So right now, you're doing just fine. 
 Now working memory has four basic components.,It allows us to store some immediate experiences,and a little bit of knowledge.,It allows us to reach backninto our long-term memory,and pull some of that in as we need it,,mixes it, processes it,in light of whatever our current goal is.,Now the current goal isn't something like,,I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.,It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,,or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.,Now working memory capacity,is our ability to leverage that,,our ability to take what we know,and what we can hang onto,and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy,our current goal. 
 Now working memory capacity,has a fairly long history,,and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.,People with high working memory capacity,tend to be good storytellers.,They tend to solve and do wellnon standardized tests,,however important that is.,They're able to have high levels of writing ability.,They're also able to reason at high levels. 
 So what we're going to do herenis play a little bit with some of that.,So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,,and we're going to take your nworking memory out for a ride.,You up for that? Okay. 
 I'm going to give you five words,,and I just want you to hang on to them.,Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.,Five words.,While you're hanging on to them,nI'm going to ask you to answer three questions.,I want to see what happens with those words.,So here's the words:,tree,,highway,,mirror,,Saturn,and electrode.,So far so good?,Okay. What I want you to do,is I want you to tell me what the answer is,to 23 times eight.,Just shout it out.,(Mumbling) (Laughter),In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter),All right. I want you to take out your left hand,and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,,six, seven, eight, nine, 10.",It's a neurological test,njust in case you were wondering.,All right, now what I want you to do,is to recite the last five letters,of the English alphabet backwards.,You should have started with Z.,(Laughter) 
 All right. How many people here are still pretty sure,you've got all five words?,Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,,right, which is normal. There will be a range.,Some people can hang on to five.,Some people can hang on to 10.,Some will be down to two or three. 
 What we know is this is really importantnto the way we function, right?,And it's going to be really important here at TED,because you're going to be exposednto so many different ideas. 
 Now the problem that we have,is that life comes at us,,and it comes at us very quickly,,and what we need to do is to take that amorphous,flow of experience and somehow,extract meaning from it,with a working memory,that's about the size of a pea.,Now don't get me wrong,nworking memory is awesome.,Working memory allows us,to investigate our current experience,as we move forward.,It allows us to make sense of the world around us.,But it does have certain limits. 
 Now working memory is greatnfor allowing us to communicate.,We can have a conversation,,and I can build a narrative around that,so I know where we've been and where we're going,and how to contribute to this conversation.,It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.,We can be in the middle of a meeting,,listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,,decide whether or not we like it,,ask follow-up questions.,All of that occurs within working memory.,It also allows us to go to the store,and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese,when what we're really looking for,is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter),Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.,Now, a central issue with working memory,is that it's limited.,It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,,limited in focus.,We tend to remember about four things.,Okay? It used to be seven,,but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,,and we were overachieving.,Now we can remember those four things,for about 10 to 20 seconds,unless we do something with it,,unless we process it,nunless we apply it to something,,unless we talk to somebody about it. 
 When we think about working memory,,we have to realize that this limited capacity,has lots of different impacts on us.,Have you ever walked from one room to another,and then forgotten why you're there?,You do know the solution to that, right?,You go back to that original room. (Laughter),Have you ever forgotten your keys?,You ever forgotten your car?,You ever forgotten your kids?,Have you ever been involved in a conversation,,and you realize that the conversation to your left,is actually more interesting? (Laughter),So you're nodding and you're smiling,,but you're really paying attentionnto this one over here,,until you hear that last word go up,,and you realize,,you've been asked a question. (Laughter),And you're really hoping the answer is no,,because that's what you're about to say.,All of that talks about working memory,,what we can do and what we can't do.,We need to realize that working memory,has a limited capacity,,and that working memory capacity itselfnis how we negotiate that.,We negotiate that through strategies. 
 So what I want to do is talk a little bitnabout a couple of strategies here,,and these will be really important,because you are now in anninformation target-rich environment,for the next several days.,Now the first part of this that we need to think about,and we need to process our existence, our life,,immediately and repeatedly.,We need to process what's going on,the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,,not a week later, at the moment.,So we need to think about, well,ndo I agree with him?,What's missing? What would I like to know?,Do I agree with the assumptions?,How can I apply this in my life?,It's a way of processing what's going on,so that we can use it later.,Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.,So we need to think about it here.,In between, we want to talk to people about it.,We're going to write it down,nand when you get home,,pull out those notes and think about them,and end up practicing over time.,Practice for some reasonnbecame a very negative thing.,It's very positive. 
 The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively,and we need to think illustratively.,Oftentimes, we think that we have to relatennew knowledge to prior knowledge.,What we want to do is spin that around.,We want to take all of our existence,and wrap it around that new knowledge,and make all of these connectionsnand it becomes more meaningful.,We also want to use imagery.nWe are built for images.,We need to take advantage of that.,Think about things in images,,write things down that way.,If you read a book, pull things up.,I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,",and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like,in my head, so my own version. 
 The last one is organization and support.,We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.,We try to make meaning out ofneverything that happens to us.,Organization helps, so we need to structure,what we're doing in ways that make sense.,If we are providing knowledge and experience,,we need to structure that. 
 And the last one is support.,We all started as novices.,Everything we do is annapproximation of sophistication.,We should expect it to change over time.nWe have to support that.,The support may come in asking people questions,,giving them a sheet of paper that hasnan organizational chart on it,or has some guiding images,,but we need to support it. 
 Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message,from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:,what we process, we learn.,If we're not processing life, we're not living it.,Live life. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So what does it meannfor a machine to be athletic?,We will demonstrate the conceptnof machine athleticism,and the research to achieve it,with the help of these flying machinesncalled quadrocopters,,or quads, for short. 
 Quads have been around for a long time.,They're so popular these daysnbecause they're mechanically simple.,By controllingnthe speeds of these four propellers,,these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,,and acceleratenalong their common orientation.,On board are also a battery, a computer,,various sensors and wireless radios. 
 Quads are extremely agile,nbut this agility comes at a cost.,They are inherently unstable,,and they need some formnof automatic feedback control,in order to be able to fly. 
 So, how did it just do that?,Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop,serve as an indoornglobal positioning system.,It's used to locate objects in the space,that have these reflectivenmarkers on them.,This data is then sent to another laptop,that is running estimationnand control algorithms,,which in turn sends commands to the quad,,which is also running estimationnand control algorithms.,The bulk of our research is algorithms.,It's the magic that bringsnthese machines to life. 
 So how does one design the algorithmsnthat create a machine athlete?,We use something broadlyncalled model-based design.,We first capture the physics,with a mathematical modelnof how the machines behave.,We then use a branch of mathematicsncalled control theory,to analyze these models,and also to synthesizenalgorithms for controlling them.,For example, that's how we cannmake the quad hover.,We first captured the dynamicsnwith a set of differential equations.,We then manipulate these equationsnwith the help of control theory,to create algorithmsnthat stabilize the quad. 
 Let me demonstratenthe strength of this approach.,Suppose that we wantnthis quad to not only hover,but to also balance this pole.,With a little bit of practice,,it's pretty straightforwardnfor a human being to do this,,although we do have the advantagenof having two feet on the ground,and the use of our very versatile hands.,It becomes a little bit more difficult,when I only have one foot on the ground,and when I don't use my hands.,Notice how this pole hasna reflective marker on top,,which means that it cannbe located in the space. 
 (Audience) Oh! 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 You can notice that this quadnis making fine adjustments,to keep the pole balanced.,How did we designnthe algorithms to do this?,We added the mathematicalnmodel of the pole,to that of the quad.,Once we have a modelnof the combined quad-pole system,,we can use control theory to createnalgorithms for controlling it.,Here, you see that it's stable,,and even if I give it little nudges,,it goes back --,to the nice, balanced position. 
 We can also augment the model,to include where we wantnthe quad to be in space.,Using this pointer,nmade out of reflective markers,,I can point to where I wantnthe quad to be in space,a fixed distance away from me. 
 (Laughter) 
 The key to these acrobaticnmaneuvers is algorithms,,designed with the helpnof mathematical models,and control theory. 
 Let's tell the quad to come back here,and let the pole drop,,and I will next demonstrate the importance,of understanding physical models,and the workings of the physical world.,Notice how the quad lost altitudenwhen I put this glass of water on it.,Unlike the balancing pole,,I did not include the mathematicalnmodel of the glass,in the system.,In fact, the system doesn't even knownthat the glass is there.,Like before, I could usenthe pointer to tell the quad,where I want it to be in space. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Okay, you should be asking yourself,,why doesn't the waternfall out of the glass?,Two facts.,The first is that gravity actsnon all objects in the same way.,The second is that the propellers,are all pointing in the same directionnof the glass, pointing up.,You put these two things together,,the net result is that all side forcesnon the glass are small,and are mainly dominatednby aerodynamic effects,,which at these speeds are negligible.,And that's why you don't neednto model the glass.,It naturally doesn't spill,nno matter what the quad does. 
 (Audience) Oh! 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 The lesson here,is that some high-performance tasksnare easier than others,,and that understandingnthe physics of the problem,tells you which ones are easynand which ones are hard.,In this instance, carryingna glass of water is easy.,Balancing a pole is hard. 
 We've all heard stories of athletesnperforming feats while physically injured.,Can a machine also performnwith extreme physical damage?,Conventional wisdom says,that you need at least four fixed motornpropeller pairs in order to fly,,because there are four degreesnof freedom to control:,roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.,Hexacopters and octocopters,nwith six and eight propellers,,can provide redundancy,,but quadrocopters are much more popular,because they have the minimum numbernof fixed motor propeller pairs: four.,Or do they? 
 (Audience) Oh! 
 (Laughter) 
 If we analyze the mathematicalnmodel of this machine,with only two working propellers,,we discover that there'snan unconventional way to fly it.,We relinquish control of yaw,,but roll, pitch and accelerationncan still be controlled,with algorithms that exploitnthis new configuration.,Mathematical models tell usnexactly when and why this is possible.,In this instance, this knowledgenallows us to design,novel machine architectures,or to design clever algorithmsnthat gracefully handle damage,,just like human athletes do,,instead of buildingnmachines with redundancy. 
 We can't help but hold our breath,when we watch a divernsomersaulting into the water,,or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,,the ground fast approaching.,Will the diver be ablento pull off a rip entry?,Will the vaulter stick the landing?,Suppose we want this quad herento perform a triple flip,and finish off at the exact samenspot that it started.,This maneuver is goingnto happen so quickly,that we can't use position feedbacknto correct the motion during execution.,There simply isn't enough time.,Instead, what the quad can donis perform the maneuver blindly,,observe how it finishes the maneuver,,and then use that informationnto modify its behavior,so that the next flip is better.,Similar to the diver and the vaulter,,it is only through repeated practice,that the maneuver cannbe learned and executed,to the highest standard. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Striking a moving ballnis a necessary skill in many sports.,How do we make a machine do,what an athlete doesnseemingly without effort? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 This quad has a racketnstrapped onto its head,with a sweet spot roughly the sizenof an apple, so not too large.,The following calculationsnare made every 20 milliseconds,,or 50 times per second.,We first figure out wherenthe ball is going.,We then next calculatenhow the quad should hit the ball,so that it fliesnto where it was thrown from.,Third, a trajectory is plannednthat carries the quad,from its current statento the impact point with the ball.,Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds'nworth of that strategy.,Twenty milliseconds later,nthe whole process is repeated,until the quad strikes the ball. 
 (Applause) 
 Machines can not only performndynamic maneuvers on their own,,they can do it collectively.,These three quads are cooperativelyncarrying a sky net. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 They perform an extremely dynamicnand collective maneuver,to launch the ball back to me.,Notice that, at full extension,nthese quads are vertical. 
 (Applause) 
 In fact, when fully extended,,this is roughly five times greaternthan what a bungee jumper feels,at the end of their launch. 
 The algorithms to do this are very similar,to what the single quad usednto hit the ball back to me.,Mathematical models are usednto continuously re-plan,a cooperative strategyn50 times per second. 
 Everything we have seen so far has beennabout the machines and their capabilities.,What happens when we couplenthis machine athleticism,with that of a human being?,What I have in front of menis a commercial gesture sensor,mainly used in gaming.,It can recognizenwhat my various body parts,are doing in real time.,Similar to the pointernthat I used earlier,,we can use this as inputs to the system.,We now have a natural way of interacting,with the raw athleticismnof these quads with my gestures. 
 (Applause) 
 Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.,It can be physical.,Take this quad, for example.,It's trying to staynat a fixed point in space.,If I try to move itnout of the way, it fights me,,and moves back to where it wants to be.,We can change this behavior, however.,We can use mathematical models,to estimate the forcenthat I'm applying to the quad.,Once we know this force,nwe can also change the laws of physics,,as far as the quadnis concerned, of course.,Here, the quad is behavingnas if it were in a viscous fluid. 
 We now have an intimate waynof interacting with a machine.,I will use this new capability to position,this camera-carrying quadnto the appropriate location,for filming the remaindernof this demonstration. 
 So we can physically interactnwith these quads,and we can change the laws of physics.,Let's have a little bit of fun with this.,For what you will see next,,these quads will initially behavenas if they were on Pluto.,As time goes on, gravity will be increased,until we're all back on planet Earth,,but I assure you we won't get there.,Okay, here goes. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Whew!,You're all thinking now,,these guys are having way too much fun,,and you're probably also asking yourself,,why exactly are they buildingnmachine athletes?,Some conjecture that the rolenof play in the animal kingdom,is to hone skillsnand develop capabilities.,Others think that it hasnmore of a social role,,that it's used to bind the group.,Similarly, we use the analogynof sports and athleticism,to create new algorithms for machines,to push them to their limits.,What impact will the speednof machines have on our way of life?,Like all our past creationsnand innovations,,they may be used to improventhe human condition,or they may be misused and abused.,This is not a technical choicenwe are faced with;,it's a social one.,Let's make the right choice,,the choice that brings out the bestnin the future of machines,,just like athleticism in sportsncan bring out the best in us. 
 Let me introduce you to the wizardsnbehind the green curtain.,They're the current membersnof the Flying Machine Arena research team. 
 (Applause) 
 Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,,Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin,nMark Muller and Robin Ritz.,Look out for them.nThey're destined for great things. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Some years ago,,I stumbled across a simple design exercise,that helps people understandnand solve complex problems,,and like many of these design exercises,nit kind of seems trivial at first,,but under deep inspection,,it turns out that it revealsnunexpected truths,about the way that we collaboratenand make sense of things. 
 The exercise has three parts,and begins with somethingnthat we all know how to do,,which is how to make toast.,It begins with a clean sheet of paper,na felt marker,,and without using any words,nyou begin to draw how to make toast.,And most people draw something like this.,They draw a loaf of bread, nwhich is sliced, then put into a toaster.,The toast is then deposited for some time.,It pops up, and then voila!nAfter two minutes, toast and happiness. 
 Now, over the years, I've collectednmany hundreds of drawings of these toasts,,and some of them are very good,,because they really illustratenthe toast-making process quite clearly.,And then there are some that are,nwell, not so good.,They really suck, actually, becausenyou don't know what they're trying to say.,Under close inspection,,some reveal some aspects of toast-makingnwhile hiding others.,So there's somenthat are all about the toast,,and all about the transformation of toast.,And there's othersnthat are all about the toaster,,and the engineers love to drawnthe mechanics of this.,(Laughter),And then there are othersnthat are about people.,It's about visualizingnthe experience that people have.,And then there are others that are aboutnthe supply chain of making toast,that goes all the way back to the store.,It goes through the supply chainnnetworks of teleportation,and all the way backnto the field and wheat,,and one all actually goesnall the way back to the Big Bang.,So it's crazy stuff.,But I think it's obvious,that even though these drawingsnare really wildly different,,they share a common quality,nand I'm wondering if you can see it.,Do you see it? What's common about these? 
 Most drawings have nodes and links.,So nodes represent the tangible objectsnlike the toaster and people,,and links representnthe connections between the nodes.,And it's the combinationnof links and nodes,that produces a full systems model,,and it makes our privatenmental models visible,about how we think something works.,So that's the value of these things.,What's interesting aboutnthese systems models,is how they revealnour various points of view.,So for example, Americansnmake toast with a toaster.,That seems obvious.,Whereas many Europeansnmake toast with a frying pan, of course,,and many students make toast with a fire.,I don't really understand this.nA lot of MBA students do this. 
 So you can measure the complexitynby counting the number of nodes,,and the average illustrationnhas between four and eight nodes.,Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,,but it's quick to understand,,and more than 13, the drawingnproduces a feeling of map shock.,It's too complex.,So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.,So if you want to communicatensomething visually,,have between five and 13 nodesnin your diagram.,So though we may notnbe skilled at drawing,,the point is that we intuitively knownhow to break down complex things,into simple things and then nbring them back together again. 
 So this brings us to our second part of nthe exercise,,which is how to make toast,,but now with sticky notesnor with cards.,So what happens then?,Well, with cards, most peoplentend to draw clear, more detailed,,and more logical nodes.,You can see the step by stepnanalysis that takes place,,and as they build up their model,nthey move their nodes around,,rearranging them like Lego blocks.,Now, though this might seem trivial,nit's actually really important.,This rapid iteration of expressingnand then reflecting and analyzing,is really the only waynin which we get clarity.,It's the essence of the design process.,And systems theorists do tell us,that the ease with whichnwe can change a representation,correlates to our willingnessnto improve the model.,So sticky note systemsnare not only more fluid,,they generally producenway more nodes than static drawings.,The drawings are much richer. 
 And this brings usnto our third part of the exercise,,which is to draw how to make toast,nbut this time in a group.,So what happens then?,Well, here's what happens.,It starts out messy,nand then it gets really messy,,and then it gets messier,,but as people refine the models,,the best nodes become more prominent,,and with each iteration,nthe model becomes clearer,because people buildnon top of each other's ideas.,What emerges is a unified systems model,that integrates the diversitynof everyone's individual points of view,,so that's a really different outcome,from what usually happens nin meetings, isn't it?,So these drawings can containn20 or more nodes,,but participants don't feel map shock,because they participate in the buildingnof their models themselves.,Now, what's also really interesting,nthat the groups spontaneously mix,and add additional layersnof organization to it.,To deal with contradictions, for example,,they add branching patternsnand parallel patterns.,Oh, and by the way,nif they do it in complete silence,,they do it much betternand much more quickly.,Really interesting --ntalking gets in the way. 
 So here's some key lessonsnthat can emerge from this.,First, drawing helps usnunderstand the situations,as systems with nodesnand their relationships.,Movable cards producenbetter systems models,,because we iterate much more fluidly.,And then the group notes produce nthe most comprehensive models,because we synthesizenseveral points of view.,So that's interesting.,When people work togethernunder the right circumstances,,group models are much betternthan individual models. 
 So this approach works really greatnfor drawing how to make toast,,but what if you wanted to drawnsomething more relevant or pressing,,like your organizational vision,nor customer experience,,or long-term sustainability? 
 There's a visual revolutionnthat's taking place,as more organizationsnare addressing their wicked problems,by collaboratively drawing them out.,And I'm convinced that those who seentheir world as movable nodes and links,really have an edge. 
 And the practice is really pretty simple.,You start with a question,nyou collect the nodes,,you refine the nodes,nyou do it over again,,you refine and refine and refine,nand the patterns emerge,,and the group gets claritynand you answer the question. 
 So this simple act of visualizingnand doing over and over again,produces some really remarkable outcomes.,What's really important to know,is that it's the conversationsnthat are the important aspects,,not just the models themselves.,And these visual frames of reference,can grow to several hundredsnor even thousands of nodes.,So, one example is fromnan organization called Rodale.,Big publishing company.,They lost a bunch of money one year,,and their executive team for three daysnvisualized their entire practice.,And what's interesting is thatnafter visualizing the entire business,,systems upon systems,,they reclaimed n50 million dollars of revenue,,and they also moved from a D rating nto an A rating from their customers.,Why? Because there'snalignment from the executive team.,So I'm now on a missionnto help organizations,solve their wicked problemsnby using collaborative visualization,,and on a site that I've producedncalled drawtoast.com,,I've collected a bunch of best practices.,and so you can learnnhow to run a workshop here,,you can learn more aboutnthe visual language,and the structure of links and nodes thatnyou can apply to general problem-solving,,and download examples of various templates,for unpacking the thorny problemsnthat we all face in our organizations.,So the seemingly trivialndesign exercise of drawing toast,helps us get clear, engaged and aligned. 
 So next time you're confrontednwith an interesting challenge,,remember what design has to teach us.,Make your ideas visible,ntangible, and consequential.,It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,,and I believe it's an ideanworth celebrating. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)One billion people in the world today,do not have access to all-season roads.,One billion people.,One seventh of the Earth's population,are totally cut off for some part of the year.,We cannot get medicine to them reliably,,they cannot get critical supplies,,and they cannot get their goods to market,in order to create a sustainable income.,In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,,85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.,Investments are being made,,but at the current level,,it's estimated it's going to take them,50 years to catch up.,In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million,miles of roads, very expensive to build,,very expensive to maintain infrastructure,,with a huge ecological footprint,,and yet, very often, congested. 
 So we saw this and we thought,,can there be a better way?,Can we create a system using today'snmost advanced technologies,that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog,in the same way they've done with mobile telephones,in the last 10 years?,Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today,without ever putting copper lines in the ground.,Could we do the same for transportation? 
 Imagine this scenario.,Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,,and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.,What would you do today?,Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,,and someone would get the request immediately.,That's the part that works.,The medication may take days to arrive, though,,because of bad roads.,That's the part that's broken. 
 We believe we can deliver it within hours,with an electric autonomous flying vehicle,such as this.,This can transport a small payloadntoday, about two kilograms,,over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,,but it's part of a wider network that may cover,the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.,It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.,It's a network for a transportation of matter.,We call it Matternet. 
 We use three key technologies.,The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.,The second is automated ground stations,that the vehicles fly in and out of,to swap batteries and fly farther,,or pick up or deliver loads.,And the third is the operating system,that manages the whole network. 
 Let's look at each one of thosentechnologies in a bit more detail.,First of all, the UAVs.,Eventually, we're going to benusing all sorts of vehicles,for different payload capacities and different ranges.,Today, we're using small quads.,These are able to transport two kilograms,over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.,Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road,in the developing world,,or even being stuck in traffic,in a developed world country.,These fly autonomously.,This is the key to the technology.,So they use GPS and other sensors on board,to navigate between ground stations.,Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic,payload and battery exchange mechanism,,so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,,they dock, swap a battery automatically,,and go out again.,The ground stations are located on safe locations,on the ground.,They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,,which is the landing.,They are at known locations on the ground,,so the paths between them are also known,,which is very important from a reliability perspective,from the whole network.,Apart from fulfilling the energynrequirements of the vehicles,,eventually they're going to be becoming,commercial hubs where people can take out loads,or put loads into the network.,The last component is the operating system,that manages the whole network.,It monitors weather data from all the ground stations,and optimizes the routes ofnthe vehicles through the system,to avoid adverse weather conditions,,avoid other risk factors,,and optimize the use of the resources,throughout the network. 
 I want to show you what one of those flights,looks like.,Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,,where we've done our first field trials.,We're modeling here a medical delivery,in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.,People there love this. 
 And I want to show you,what one of those vehicles looks like up close.,So this is a $3,000 vehicle.,Costs are coming down very rapidly.,We use this in all sorts of weather conditions,,very hot and very cold climates,,very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.,Imagine if your life depended on this package,,somewhere in Africa,or in New York City, after Sandy.,The next big question is, what's the cost? 
 Well, it turns out that the cost to transport,two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle,is just 24 cents. 
 (Applause) 
 And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy,expended for the flight is only two cents,of a dollar today,,and we're just at the beginning of this.,When we saw this, we felt that this is something,that can have significant impact in the world. 
 So we said, okay, how much does it cost,to set up a network somewhere in the world?,And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho,for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.,The problem there is how do you take them,from clinics where they're being collected,to hospitals where they're being analyzed?,And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area,spanning around 140 square kilometers?,That's roughly one and a half timesnthe size of Manhattan.,Well it turns out that the cost to do that there,would be less than a million dollars.,Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.,We think this can be -- this is the power,of a new paradigm. 
 So here we are: a new idea,about a network for transportation,that is based on the ideas of the Internet.,It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,,it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,,with very low infrastructure investment,,very low ecological footprint.,If it is a new paradigm, though,,there must be other uses for it.,It can be used perhaps in other places in the world. 
 So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:,our cities and megacities.,Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.,Half a billion of us live in megacities.,We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.,China alone is adding a megacity,the size of New York City every two years.,These are places that do have road infrastructure,,but it's very inefficient.,Congestion is a huge problem.,So we think it makes sense in those places,to set up a network of transportation,that is a new layer that sits between the road,and the Internet,,initially for lightweight, urgent stuff,,and over time, we would hope to develop this,into a new mode of transportation,that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.,It's ultimately scalable,with a very small ecological footprint,,operating in the background 24/7,,just like the Internet. 
 So when we started this,a couple of years ago now,,we've had a lot of people come up to us who said,,"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,,and certainly not something that you should,engage with anytime soon.",And of course, we're talking about drones, right,,a technology that's not only unpopular in the West,but one that has become a very, very unpleasant,fact of life for many living in poor countries,,especially those engaged in conflict. 
 So why are we doing this?,Well, we chose to do this one,not because it's easy,,but because it can have amazing impact.,Imagine one billion people being connected,to physical goods in the same way,that mobile telecommunications connected them,to information.,Imagine if the next big network we built in the world,was a network for the transportation of matter.,In the developing world, we would hope,to reach millions of people with better vaccines,,reach them with better medication.,It would give us an unfair advantage against battling,HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.,Over time, we would hope it would become,a new platform for economic transactions,,lifting millions of people out of poverty.,In the developed world and the emerging world,,we would hope it would become a new mode,of transportation that could help make our cities,more livable. 
 So for those that still believenthat this is science fiction,,I firmly say to you that it is not.,We do need to engage, though,,in social fiction to make it happen. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So my moment of truth,did not come all at once.,In 2010, I had the chance to be considered,for promotion from my job,as director of policy planning,at the U.S. State Department.,This was my moment to lean in,,to push myself forward,for what are really only a handful,of the very top foreign policy jobs,,and I had just finished a big, 18-month project,for Secretary Clinton, successfully,,and I knew I could handle a bigger job. 
 The woman I thought I was,would have said yes.,But I had been commuting for two years,between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,,where my husband and my two teenage sons lived,,and it was not going well.,I tried on the idea of eking out another two years,in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons,from their school and my husband from his work,and asking them to join me.,But deep down, I knew,that the right decision was to go home,,even if I didn't fully recognize the woman,who was making that choice. 
 That was a decision based on love,and responsibility.,I couldn't keep watching my oldest son,make bad choices,without being able to be there for him,when and if he needed me.,But the real change came more gradually.,Over the next year,,while my family was righting itself,,I started to realize,that even if I could go back into government,,I didn't want to.,I didn't want to miss the last five years,that my sons were at home.,I finally allowed myself to accept,what was really most important to me,,not what I was conditioned to want,or maybe what I conditioned myself to want,,and that decision led to a reassessment,of the feminist narrative that I grew up with,and have always championed. 
 I am still completely committed,to the cause of male-female equality,,but let's think about what that equality really means,,and how best to achieve it.,I always accepted the idea,that the most respected and powerful people,in our society are men at the top of their careers,,so that the measure of male-female equality,ought to be how many women are in those positions:,prime ministers, presidents, CEOs,,directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.,I still think we should do everything we possibly can,to achieve that goal.,But that's only half of real equality,,and I now think we're never going to get there,unless we recognize the other half.,I suggest that real equality,,full equality,,does not just mean valuing women,on male terms.,It means creating a much wider range,of equally respected choices,for women and for men.,And to get there, we have to change our workplaces,,our policies and our culture. 
 In the workplace,,real equality means valuing family,just as much as work,,and understanding that the two reinforce each other.,As a leader and as a manager,,I have always acted on the mantra,,if family comes first,,work does not come second --,life comes together.,If you work for me, and you have a family issue,,I expect you to attend to it,,and I am confident,,and my confidence has always been borne out,,that the work will get done, and done better.,Workers who have a reason to get home,to care for their children or their family members,are more focused, more efficient,,more results-focused.,And breadwinners who are also caregivers,have a much wider range,of experiences and contacts.,Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time,at school events for his kids,talking to other parents.,He's much more likely to bring in,new clients for his firm,than a lawyer who never leaves his office.,And caregiving itself,develops patience --,a lot of patience --,and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.,Those are all attributes that are ever more important,in a high-speed, horizontal,,networked global economy. 
 The best companies actually know this.,The companies that win awards,for workplace flexibility in the United States,include some of our most successful corporations,,and a 2008 national study,on the changing workforce,showed that employees,in flexible and effective workplaces,are more engaged with their work,,they're more satisfied and more loyal,,they have lower levels of stress,and higher levels of mental health.,And a 2012 study of employers,showed that deep, flexible practices,actually lowered operating costs,and increased adaptability,in a global service economy. 
 So you may think,that the privileging of work over family,is only an American problem.,Sadly, though, the obsession with work,is no longer a uniquely American disease.,Twenty years ago,,when my family first started going to Italy,,we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.,Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.,It's actually just as much,about embracing the warmth of a family lunch.,Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses,close for siesta,,reflecting the advance of global corporations,and 24-hour competition.,So making a place for those we love,is actually a global imperative. 
 In policy terms,,real equality means recognizing,that the work that women have traditionally done,is just as important,as the work that men have traditionally done,,no matter who does it.,Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving,are equally necessary for human survival.,At least if we get beyond a barter economy,,somebody has to earn an income,and someone else has to convert that income,to care and sustenance for loved ones. 
 Now most of you, when you hear me,talk about breadwinning and caregiving,,instinctively translate those categories,into men's work and women's work.,And we don't typically challenge,why men's work is advantaged.,But consider a same-sex couple,like my friends Sarah and Emily.,They're psychiatrists.,They got married five years ago,,and now they have two-year-old twins.,They love being mothers,,but they also love their work,,and they're really good at what they do.,So how are they going to divide up,breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?,Should one of them stop working,or reduce hours to be home?,Or should they both change their practices,so they can have much more flexible schedules?,And what criteria should they use,to make that decision?,Is it who makes the most money,or who is most committed to her career?,Or who has the most flexible boss? 
 The same-sex perspective helps us see,that juggling work and family,are not women's problems,,they're family problems.,And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,,because they have a choice,about how much they want to work.,Millions of men and women,have to be both breadwinners and caregivers,just to earn the income they need,,and many of those workers are scrambling.,They're patching together care arrangements,that are inadequate,and often actually unsafe.,If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,,then why shouldn't a government,invest as much in an infrastructure of care,as the foundation of a healthy society,as it invests in physical infrastructure,as the backbone of a successful economy? 
 The governments that get it --,no surprises here --,the governments that get it,,Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,,provide universal child care,,support for caregivers at home,,school and early childhood education,,protections for pregnant women,,and care for the elderly and the disabled.,Those governments invest in that infrastructure,the same way they invest in roads and bridges,and tunnels and trains.,Those societies also show you,that breadwinning and caregiving,reinforce each other.,They routinely rank among the top 15 countries,of the most globally competitive economies,,but at the same time,,they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.,In fact, they rank higher than other governments,,like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,,that have higher average levels of income,but lower rankings on work-life balance. 
 So changing our workplaces,and building infrastructures of care,would make a big difference,,but we're not going to get equally valued choices,unless we change our culture,,and the kind of cultural change required,means re-socializing men.,(Applause),Increasingly in developed countries,,women are socialized to believe that our place,is no longer only in the home,,but men are actually still where they always were.,Men are still socialized to believe,that they have to be breadwinners,,that to derive their self-worth,from how high they can climb over other men,on a career ladder.,The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.,It's certainly not complete.,But 60 years after,"The FemininenMystique" was published,,many women actually have,more choices than men do.,We can decide to be a breadwinner,,a caregiver, or any combination of the two.,When a man, on the other hand,,decides to be a caregiver,,he puts his manhood on the line.,His friends may praise his decision,,but underneath, they're scratching their heads.,Isn't the measure of a man,his willingness to compete with other men,for power and prestige?,And as many women hold that view as men do.,We know that lots of women,still judge the attractiveness of a man,based in large part on how successful he is,in his career.,A woman can drop out of the work force,and still be an attractive partner.,For a man, that's a risky proposition.,So as parents and partners,,we should be socializing our sons,and our husbands,to be whatever they want to be,,either caregivers or breadwinners.,We should be socializing them to make caregiving,cool for guys.,(Applause) 
 I can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way.",But in fact, the change is nactually already happening.,At least in the United States,,lots of men take pride in cooking,,and frankly obsess over stoves.,They are in the birthing rooms.,They take paternity leave when they can.,They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler,just as well as their wives can,,and they are increasingly,doing much more of the housework.,Indeed, there are male college students now,who are starting to say,,"I want to be a stay-at-home dad.",That was completely unthinkable,50 or even 30 years ago.,And in Norway, where men have,an automatic three month's paternity leave,,but they lose it if they decide not to take it,,a high government official told me,that companies are starting to look,at prospective male employees,and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact,take their leave when they had kids.,That means that it's starting to seem,like a character defect,not to want to be a fully engaged father. 
 So I was raised,to believe that championing women's rights,meant doing everything we could,to get women to the top.,And I still hope that I live long enough,to see men and women equally represented,at all levels of the work force.,But I've come to believe that we have to value family,every bit as much as we value work,,and that we should entertain the idea,that doing right by those we love,will make all of us better at everything we do. 
 Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,,a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls,and identified an ethic of care,,an element of human nature every bit as important,as the ethic of justice.,It turns out that "you don't care",is just as much a part of who we are,as "that's not fair.",Bill Gates agrees.,He argues that the two great forces of human nature,are self-interest and caring for others.,Let's bring them both together.,Let's make the feminist revolution,a humanist revolution.,As whole human beings,,we will be better caregivers and breadwinners.,You may think that can't happen,,but I grew up in a society,where my mother put out small vases,of cigarettes for dinner parties,,where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,,and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.,Today, not so much.,The revolution for human equality,can happen.,It is happening.,It will happen.,How far and how fast is up to us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,,so if I say "killer robots,",you'd probably think something like this.,But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.,I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,,autonomous combat drones. 
 Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,,which have a human making targeting decisions.,I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons,that make lethal decisions about human beings,all on their own.,There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy. 
 Now, lethally autonomous killer robots,would take many forms -- flying, driving,,or just lying in wait.,And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.,These are two automatic sniper stations,currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.,Both of these machines are capable of automatically,identifying a human target and firing on it,,the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.,Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop,to make that lethal firing decision,,but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.,And it's that choice that I want to focus on,,because as we migrate lethal decision-making,from humans to software,,we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,,but also changing our social landscape entirely,,far from the battlefield.,That's because the way humans resolve conflict,shapes our social landscape.,And this has always been the case, throughout history. 
 For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems,in 1400 A.D.,Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,,but with these you could dominate the populace,,and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.,Power was focused at the very top.,And what changed? Technological innovation.,Gunpowder, cannon.,And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,,and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield,versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.,And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose,as a political and logistical requirement of defense.,And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,,they began to share power.,Representative government began to form. 
 So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict,shape our social landscape.,Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,,except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,,they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,,possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy. 
 Now, I think, knowing this,,we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,,to do what humans do best, which is adapt.,But time is a factor.,Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted,combat drones of their own,,and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones,are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.,That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,,there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making,away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself. 
 The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.,For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced,a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.,By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,,outstripping human ability to review it all,,but even that number is about to go up drastically.,The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs,will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes,on each drone platform,,and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.,And that means visual intelligence software will need,to scan it for items of interest.,And that means very soon,drones will tell humans what to look at,,not the other way around. 
 But there's a second powerful incentive pushing,decision-making away from humans and onto machines,,and that's electromagnetic jamming,,severing the connection between the drone,and its operator.,Now we saw an example of this in 2011,when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone,got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,,but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,,and that means drones,will have to shoulder more decision-making.,They'll know their mission objective,,and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.,They'll ignore external radio signals,and send very few of their own. 
 Which brings us to, really, the third,and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making,away from humans and onto weapons:,plausible deniability.,Now we live in a global economy.,High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.,Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs,to parts unknown,,and in that environment, it is very likely,that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,,proliferate in the gray market.,And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage,of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say,who sent that weapon. 
 This raises the very real possibility,of anonymous war.,This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,,make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower,against an attacker, and that could shift the balance,in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.,It could make military action a viable option,not just for small nations,,but criminal organizations, private enterprise,,even powerful individuals.,It could create a landscape of rival warlords,undermining rule of law and civil society.,Now if responsibility and transparency,are two of the cornerstones of representative government,,autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both. 
 Now you might be thinking that,citizens of high-tech nations,would have the advantage in any robotic war,,that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,,particularly against developing nations.,But I think the truth is the exact opposite.,I think citizens of high-tech societies,are more vulnerable to robotic weapons,,and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.,Data powers high-tech societies.,Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,,social media, email, text, financial transaction data,,transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data,on the movements and social interactions of people.,In short, we are more visible to machines,than any people in history,,and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons. 
 What you're looking at here,is a link analysis map of a social group.,Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.,And these types of maps can be automatically generated,based on the data trail modern people leave behind.,Now it's typically used to market goods and services,to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,,because targeting is used in another context.,Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.,These are the hubs of social networks.,These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,,and these people also can be automatically identified,from their communication patterns.,Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them,with product samples, try to spread your brand,through their social group.,But if you're a repressive government,searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,,eliminate them, disrupt their social group,,and those who remain behind lose social cohesion,and organization.,Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,,borders would offer very little protection,to critics of distant governments,or trans-national criminal organizations.,Popular movements agitating for change,could be detected early and their leaders eliminated,before their ideas achieve critical mass.,And ideas achieving critical mass,is what political activism in popular government is all about.,Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action,an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.,And this would put a chill on free speech,and popular political action, the very heart of democracy. 
 And this is why we need an international treaty,on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban,on the development and deployment of killer robots.,Now we already have international treaties,on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,,these have largely worked.,But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,,because they will almost certainly be used,,and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions. 
 Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense,issued a directive requiring,a human being be present in all lethal decisions.,This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,,but that directive needs to be made permanent.,And it could set the stage for global action.,Because we need an international legal framework,for robotic weapons.,And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack,or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world,to rush to adopt these weapons,before thinking through the consequences.,Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power,in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself. 
 Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons,of great uses for unarmed civilian drones:,environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.,If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,,how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones,and vehicles while still protecting ourselves,against illegal robotic weapons? 
 I think the secret will be transparency.,No robot should have an expectation of privacy,in a public place. 
 (Applause) 
 Each robot and drone should have,a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory,that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.,We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.,This is no different.,And every citizen should be able to download an app,that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles,moving through public spaces around them,,both right now and historically.,And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones,to detect rogue drones,,and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,,they should notify humans to their presence.,And in certain very high-security areas,,perhaps civic drones would snare them,and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility. 
 But notice, this is more an immune system,than a weapons system.,It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use,of autonomous vehicles and drones,while still preserving our open, civil society. 
 We must ban the deployment and development,of killer robots.,Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.,Autocratic governments and criminal organizations,undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.,Autonomous robotic weapons,would concentrate too much power,in too few unseen hands,,and that would be corrosive to representative government.,Let's make sure, for democracies at least,,killer robots remain fiction. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)Once upon a time,we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.,This was called the Great Moderation,,the misguided belief by most economists,,policymakers and central banks,that we have transformed into a new world,of never-ending growth and prosperity.,This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,,by low and controlled inflation,,by low unemployment,,and controlled and low financial volatility. 
 But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,,the great crash, broke this illusion.,A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector,cascaded into five trillion dollars,of losses in world GDP,and almost $30 trillion losses,in the global stock market. 
 So the understanding of this Great Recession,was that this was completely surprising,,this came out of the blue,,this was like the wrath of the gods.,There was no responsibility.,So, as a reflection of this,,we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.,We had the goal to diagnose in real time,financial bubbles,and identify in advance their critical time. 
 What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?,We developed a theory called "dragon-kings.",Dragon-kings represent extreme events,which are of a class of their own.,They are special. They are outliers.,They are generated by specific mechanisms,that may make them predictable,,perhaps controllable. 
 Consider the financial price time series,,a given stock, your perfect stock,,or a global index.,You have these up-and-downs.,A very good measure of the risk of this financial market,is the peaks-to-valleys that represent,a worst case scenario,when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.,You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence,of peak-to-valleys of different sizes,,which is represented in this graph.,Now, interestingly, 99 percent,of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes,can be represented by a universal power law,represented by this red line here.,More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions,which are above this red line,,occur 100 times more frequently, at least,,than the extrapolation would predict them to occur,based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining,peak-to-valleys.,They are due to trenchant dependancies,such that a loss is followed by a loss,which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.,These kinds of dependencies,are largely missed by standard risk management tools,,which ignore them and see lizards,when they should see dragon-kings.,The root mechanism of a dragon-king,is a slow maturation towards instability,,which is the bubble,,and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.,This is similar to the slow heating of water,in this test tube reaching the boiling point,,where the instability of the water occurs,and you have the phase transition to vapor.,And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --,cannot be predicted by standard techniques --,is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior,which is fundamentally endogenous.,So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis,has to be found in an inner instability of the system,,and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur. 
 Now, some of you may have come to the mind,that is this not related to the black swan concept,you have heard about frequently?,Remember, black swan is this rare bird,that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief,that all swans should be white,,so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,,unknowability, that the extreme events,are fundamentally unknowable.,Nothing can be further,from the dragon-king concept I propose,,which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events,are actually knowable and predictable.,So we can be empowered and take responsibility,and make predictions about them.,So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are many early warning signals,that are predicted by this theory.,Let me just focus on one of them:,the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.,What does it mean?,Imagine you have an investment,that returns the first year five percent,,the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,,the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?,This is a super-exponential growth.,A standard exponential growth corresponds,to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent,The point is that, many times during bubbles,,there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,,such that previous growths enhance,,push forward, increase the next growth,through this kind of super-exponential growth,,which is very trenchant, not sustainable.,And the key idea is that the mathematical solution,of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,,which means that there is a critical time,where the system will break, will change regime.,It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.,And the key idea is that the critical time,,the information about the critical time is contained,in the early development of this super-exponential growth. 
 We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,,to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements,on the iron rocket.,Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise,that you hear a structure emit, sing to you,when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,,there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,,the more damage gives the more damage,,so you can actually predict,,within, of course, a probability band,,when the rupture will occur.,So this is now so successful that it is used,in the initial phase of [unclear] the flight. 
 Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory,applies to biology and medicine,,parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.,From seven months of pregnancy, a mother,starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus,that are the sign of these maturations,toward the instability, giving birth to the baby,,the dragon-king.,So if you measure the precursor signal,,you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems,in advance.,Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,,and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,,you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability,and this can help the patient to deal with this illness.,We have applied this theory to many systems,,landslides, glacier collapse,,even to the dynamics of prediction of success:,blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.,But perhaps the most important application,is for finance, and this theory,illuminates, I believe, the deep reason,for the financial crisis that we have gone through.,This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,,starting in 1980, with the global bubble,crashing in 1987,,followed by many other bubbles.,The biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble,in 2000, crashing in 2000,,the real estate bubbles in many countries,,financial derivative bubbles everywhere,,stock market bubbles also everywhere,,commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --,bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. 
 We had a global bubble.,This is a measure of global overvaluation,of all markets, expressing what I call,an illusion of a perpetual money machine,that suddenly broke in 2007. 
 The problem is that we see the same process,,in particular through quantitative easing,,of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays,to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,,in Japan.,This has very important implications,to understand the failure of quantitative easing,as well as austerity measures,as long as we don't attack the core,,the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking. 
 Now, these are big claims.,Why would you believe me?,Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years,we have come out of our ivory tower,,and started to publish ex ante --,and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" —,before the crash confirmed,the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.,These are a few of the major bubbles,that we have lived through in recent history.,Again, many interesting stories for each of them.,Let me tell you just one or two stories,that deal with massive bubbles. 
 We all know the Chinese miracle.,This is the expression of the stock market,of a massive bubble, a factor of three,,300 percent in just a few years.,In September 2007,,I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund,management conference,,and I showed to the conference a prediction,that by the end of 2007, this bubble,would change regime.,There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.,Now, how do you believe the very smart,,very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers,reacted to this prediction?,You know, they had made billions,just surfing this bubble until now.,They told me, "Didier,,yeah, the market might be overvalued,,but you forget something.,There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming,in August 2008, and it's very clear that,the Chinese government is controlling the economy,and doing what it takes,to also avoid any wave and control the stock market." 
 Three weeks after my presentation,,the markets lost 20 percent,and went through a phase of volatility,,upheaval, and a total market loss of,70 percent until the end of the year. 
 So how can we be so collectively wrong,by misreading or ignoring the science,of the fact that when an instability has developed,,and the system is ripe, any perturbation,makes it essentially impossible to control? 
 The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.,In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,,a smaller one, was unsustainable,,so we published again a prediction, in advance,,stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,,will not continue on this track.,Our critics, reading the prediction,,said, "No, it's not possible.,The Chinese government is there.,They have learned their lesson. They will control.,They want to benefit from the growth.",Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.,So the crisis did occur. The market corrected. 
 The same critics then said, "Ah, yes,,but you published your prediction.,You influenced the market.,It was not a prediction." 
 Maybe I am very powerful then.,Now, this is interesting.,It shows that it's essentially impossible until now,to develop a science of economics,because we are sentient beings who anticipate,and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies. 
 So we invented a new way of doing science.,We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.,The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.,We identify excesses, bubbles.,We do our work. We write a report,in which we put our prediction of the critical time.,We don't release the report. It's kept secret.,But with modern encrypting techniques,,we have a hash, we publish a public key,,and six months later, we release the report,,and there is authentication.,And all this is done on an international archive,so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes. 
 Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.,17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,,we identified that the U.S. stock market,was on an unsustainable path,and we released this on our website on the 21st of May,that there will be a change of regime.,The next day, the market started to change regime, course.,This is not a crash.,This is just the third or fourth act,of a massive bubble in the making.,Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,,we see the same thing.,Wherever we look, it's observable:,in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,,showing these super-exponential trajectories,characterizing an unsustainable path,and announcing a phase transition.,This diagram on the right,shows a very beautiful compilation of studies,suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility,for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades. 
 So there are bubbles everywhere.,From one side, this is exciting,for me, as a professor who chases bubbles,and slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me. 
 But can we really slay the dragons?,Very recently, with collaborators,,we studied a dynamical system,where you see the dragon-king as these big loops,and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times,that removed, when control is on, these dragons. 
 "Gouverner, c'est prévoir.",Governing is the art of planning and predicting.,But is it not the case that this is probably,one of the biggest gaps of mankind,,which has the responsibility to steer,our societies and our planet toward sustainability,in the face of growing challenges and crises? 
 But the dragon-king theory gives hope.,We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.,It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises,so that we can be prepared, we can take measures,,we can take responsibility,,and so that never again will,extremes and crises like the Great Recession,or the European crisis take us by surprise. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on,involving a man named Steve Titus. 
 Titus was a restaurant manager.,He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,,he was engaged to Gretchen,,about to be married, she was the love of his life.,And one night, the couple went out,for a romantic restaurant meal.,They were on their way home,,and they were pulled over by a police officer.,You see, Titus' car sort of resembled,a car that was driven earlier in the evening,by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,,and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.,So the police took a picture of Titus,,they put it in a photo lineup,,they later showed it to the victim,,and she pointed to Titus' photo.,She said, "That one's the closest.",The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,,and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,,the rape victim got on the stand,and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man.",And Titus was convicted.,He proclaimed his innocence,,his family screamed at the jury,,his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,,and Titus is taken away to jail. 
 So what would you do at this point?,What would you do?,Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,,and yet he got an idea.,He called up the local newspaper,,he got the interest of an investigative journalist,,and that journalist actually found the real rapist,,a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,,a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes,in that area,,and when this information was given to the judge,,the judge set Titus free. 
 And really, that's where this case should have ended.,It should have been over.,Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,,a year of accusation and trial, but over. 
 It didn't end that way.,Titus was so bitter.,He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.,He lost his fiancée.,She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.,He lost his entire savings,,and so he decided to file a lawsuit,against the police and others whom he felt,were responsible for his suffering. 
 And that's when I really started working on this case,,trying to figure out,how did that victim go from,"That one's the closest",to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy." 
 Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.,He spent every waking moment thinking about it,,and just days before he was to have his day in court,,he woke up in the morning,,doubled over in pain,,and died of a stress-related heart attack.,He was 35 years old. 
 So I was asked to work on Titus' case,because I'm a psychological scientist.,I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.,And if I meet somebody on an airplane --,this happened on the way over to Scotland --,if I meet somebody on an airplane,,and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?",and I say "I study memory,",they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,,or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's,or some kind of memory problem,,but I have to tell them,I don't study when people forget.,I study the opposite: when they remember,,when they remember things that didn't happen,or remember things that were different,from the way they really were.,I study false memories. 
 Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person,to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.,In one project in the United States,,information has been gathered,on 300 innocent people,,300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.,They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,,and now DNA testing has proven,that they are actually innocent.,And when those cases have been analyzed,,three quarters of them,are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory. 
 Well, why?,Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people,and the jurors who convicted Titus,,many people believe that memory,works like a recording device.,You just record the information,,then you call it up and play it back,when you want to answer questions or identify images.,But decades of work in psychology,has shown that this just isn't true.,Our memories are constructive.,They're reconstructive.,Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:,You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.,I first started studying this constructive memory process,in the 1970s.,I did my experiments that involved showing people,simulated crimes and accidents,and asking them questions about what they remember.,In one study, we showed people a simulated accident,and we asked people,,how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?,And we asked other people,,how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?,And if we asked the leading "smashed" question,,the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,,and moreover, that leading "smashed" question,caused people to be more likely to tell us,that they saw broken glass in the accident scene,when there wasn't any broken glass at all.,In another study, we showed a simulated accident,where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,,and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,,many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign,at the intersection, not a stop sign. 
 And you might be thinking, well, you know,,these are filmed events,,they are not particularly stressful.,Would the same kind of mistakes be made,with a really stressful event?,In a study we published just a few months ago,,we have an answer to this question,,because what was unusual about this study,is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.,The subjects in this study,were members of the U.S. military,who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise,to teach them what it's going to be like for them,if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.,And as part of this training exercise,,these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,,hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes,and later on they have to try to identify,the person who conducted that interrogation.,And when we feed them suggestive information,that insinuates it's a different person,,many of them misidentify their interrogator,,often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely,resemble the real interrogator. 
 And so what these studies are showing,is that when you feed people misinformation,about some experience that they may have had,,you can distort or contaminate or change their memory. 
 Well out there in the real world,,misinformation is everywhere.,We get misinformation,not only if we're questioned in a leading way,,but if we talk to other witnesses,who might consciously or inadvertently feed us,some erroneous information,,or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,,all of these provide the opportunity,for this kind of contamination of our memory. 
 In the 1990s, we began to see,an even more extreme kind of memory problem.,Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --,maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --,and they were coming out of therapy,with a different problem.,Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,,sometimes in satanic rituals,,sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.,One woman came out of psychotherapy,believing that she'd endured years,of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy,and that the baby was cut from her belly.,But there were no physical scars,or any kind of physical evidence,that could have supported her story.,And when I began looking into these cases,,I was wondering,,where do these bizarre memories come from?,And what I found is that most of these situations,involved some particular form of psychotherapy.,And so I asked,,were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --,like the imagination exercises,or dream interpretation,,or in some cases hypnosis,,or in some cases exposure to false information --,were these leading these patients,to develop these very bizarre,,unlikely memories?,And I designed some experiments,to try to study the processes that were being used,in this psychotherapy so I could study,the development of these very rich false memories. 
 In one of the first studies we did,,we used suggestion,,a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,,we used this kind of suggestion,and planted a false memory,that when you were a kid, five or six years old,,you were lost in a shopping mall.,You were frightened. You were crying.,You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person,and reunited with the family.,And we succeeded in planting this memory,in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.,And you might be thinking, well,,that's not particularly stressful.,But we and other investigators have planted,rich false memories of things that were,much more unusual and much more stressful.,So in a study done in Tennessee,,researchers planted the false memory,that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned,and had to be rescued by a life guard.,And in a study done in Canada,,researchers planted the false memory,that when you were a kid,,something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal,happened to you,,succeeding with about half of their subjects.,And in a study done in Italy,,researchers planted the false memory,,when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession. 
 I do want to add that it might seem,like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects,in the name of science,,but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation,by research ethics boards,that have made the decision,that the temporary discomfort that some,of these subjects might experience in these studies,is outweighed by the importance of this problem,for understanding memory processes,and the abuse of memory that is going on,in some places in the world. 
 Well, to my surprise,,when I published this work and began to speak out,against this particular brand of psychotherapy,,it created some pretty bad problems for me:,hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,,who felt under attack,,and by the patients whom they had influenced.,I had sometimes armed guards at speeches,that I was invited to give,,people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.,But probably the worst,was I suspected that a woman,was innocent of abuse,that was being claimed by her grown daughter.,She accused her mother of sexual abuse,based on a repressed memory.,And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story,to be filmed and presented in public places.,I was suspicious of this story,,and so I started to investigate,,and eventually found information that convinced me,that this mother was innocent.,I published an exposé on the case,,and a little while later, the accusing daughter,filed a lawsuit.,Even though I'd never mentioned her name,,she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.,And I went through nearly five years,of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,,but finally, finally, it was over and I could really,get back to my work.,In the process, however, I became part,of a disturbing trend in America,where scientists are being sued,for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy. 
 When I got back to my work, I asked this question:,if I plant a false memory in your mind,,does it have repercussions?,Does it affect your later thoughts,,your later behaviors?,Our first study planted a false memory,that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:,hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.,And we found that once we planted this false memory,,people didn't want to eat the foods as much,at an outdoor picnic.,The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.,If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory,involving a healthy food like asparagus,,we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.,And so what these studies are showing,is that you can plant false memories,and they have repercussions,that affect behavior long after the memories take hold. 
 Well, along with this ability,to plant memories and control behavior,obviously come some important ethical issues,,like, when should we use this mind technology?,And should we ever ban its use?,Therapists can't ethically plant false memories,in the mind of their patients,even if it would help the patient,,but there's nothing to stop a parent,from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.,And when I suggested this publicly,,it created an outcry again.,"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children." 
 Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter) 
 I mean, another way to think about this is,,which would you rather have,,a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,,all the things that go with it,,or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?,I know what I would choose for a kid of mine. 
 But maybe my work has made me different from most people.,Most people cherish their memories,,know that they represent their identity,,who they are, where they came from.,And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.,But I know from my work,how much fiction is already in there.,If I've learned anything from these decades,of working on these problems, it's this:,just because somebody tells you something,and they say it with confidence,,just because they say it with lots of detail,,just because they express emotion when they say it,,it doesn't mean that it really happened.,We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.,We need independent corroboration.,Such a discovery has made me more tolerant,of the everyday memory mistakes,that my friends and family members make.,Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,,the man whose whole future was snatched away,by a false memory. 
 But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,,we'd do well to,,that memory, like liberty,,is a fragile thing.,Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you. (Applause),Thanks very much. (Applause)This will not be a speech,like any one I have ever given.,I will talk to you today about,the failure of leadership in global politics,and in our globalizing economy.,And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.,But I will in the end urge you,to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved,in what I see as a global evolution,of democracy. 
 Failure of leadership.,What is the failure of leadership today?,And why is our democracy not working?,Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact,that we have taken you out of the process.,So let me, from my personal experiences,,give you an insight, so that you can step back,and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope,with the challenges of today and why politics,is going down a blind alley. 
 Let's start from the beginning.,Let's start from democracy.,Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,,it was a revelation, a discovery,,that we had the potential, together,,to be masters of our own fate,,to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,,and then to design a better life.,And democracy was the political innovation,which protected this freedom,,because we were liberated from fear,so that our minds in fact,,whether they be despots or dogmas,,could be the protagonists.,Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us,to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants,or of high priests,,their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth. 
 Well, I first began to understand this,when I was 14 years old.,I used to, to try to avoid homework,,sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents,and their friends debate heatedly.,You see, then Greece was,under control of a very powerful establishment,which was strangling the country,,and my father was heading a promising movement,to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece,where freedom reigned and where, maybe,,the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country. 
 I used to join him in many of the campaigns,,and you can see me here next to him.,I'm the younger one there, to the side.,You may not recognize me because,I used to part my hair differently there. 
 (Laughter) 
 So in 1967, elections were coming,,things were going well in the campaign,,the house was electric.,We really could sense that there was going to be,a major progressive change in Greece. 
 Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.,Soldiers storm the door.,They find me up on the top terrace.,A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,,puts it to my head, and says,,"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you.",My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,,and was summarily taken to prison. 
 Well, we survived, but democracy did not.,Seven brutal years of dictatorship,which we spent in exile. 
 Now, today, our democracies are again,facing a moment of truth.,Let me tell you a story.,Sunday evening,,Brussels, April 2010.,I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.,I had just been elected prime minister,,but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth,that our deficit was not 6 percent,,as had been officially reported only a few days earlier,before the elections by the previous government,,but actually 15.6 percent.,But the deficit was only the symptom,of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,,and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,,to tackle these problems,,whether it was lack of transparency,and accountability in governance,,or whether it was a clientelistic state,offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance,abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,,politics and media captured by special interests.,But despite our electoral mandate,,the markets mistrusted us.,Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,,and we were facing possible default. 
 So I went to Brussels on a mission,to make the case for a united European response,,one that would calm the markets and give us the time,to make the necessary reforms.,But time we didn't get.,Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.,Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,,progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,,a prime minister shouts out,,"We have to finish in 10 minutes." 
 I said, "Why? These are important decisions.,Let's deliberate a little bit longer." 
 Another prime minister comes in and says,,"No, we have to have an agreement now,,because in 10 minutes,,the markets are opening up in Japan,,and there will be havoc in the global economy." 
 We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.,This time it was not the military,,but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.,What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,,painful to me, painful to my countrymen,,imposing cuts, austerity,,often on those not to blame for the crisis.,With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy,and the eurozone avoided a collapse. 
 Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,,and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.,But I think today that most would agree,that Greece was only a symptom,of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,,vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,,vulnerabilities of our democracies.,Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,,or, more accurately, too big to control.,Our democracies are weakened in the global economy,with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,,evade environmental or labor standards.,Our democracies are undermined,by the growing inequality,and the growing concentration of power and wealth,,lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets,or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,,have constrained our democracies,,and they have constrained our capacity,to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,,in finding solutions. 
 Greece, you see, was only a preview,of what is in store for us all.,I, overly optimistically, had hoped,that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,,for the world, to make radical democratic transformations,in our institutions.,Instead, I had a very humbling experience.,In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again,to find common solutions,,I realized that not one, not one of us,,had ever dealt with a similar crisis.,But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.,We were led by our fears.,And our fears led to a blind faith,in the orthodoxy of austerity.,Instead of reaching out to the common,or the collective wisdom in our societies,,investing in it to find more creative solutions,,we reverted to political posturing.,And then we were surprised when every,ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,,and of course that made it very easy,to look for a whipping boy,for our collective European failure,,and of course that was Greece.,Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,,they are the problem. Punish them!,Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype,that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself. 
 But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.,This could be the pattern,that leaders follow again and again,when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,,whether it's climate change, whether it's migration,,whether it's the financial system.,That is, abandoning our collective power,to imagine our potential,,falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,,taking our citizens out of the process,rather than building the process around our citizens.,And doing so will only test the faith,of our citizens, of our peoples, even more,in the democratic process. 
 It's no wonder that many political leaders,,and I don't exclude myself,,have lost the trust of our people.,When riot police have to protect parliaments,,a scene which is increasingly common around the world,,then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.,That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people,own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.,My European counterparts, some of them, at least,,said, "You can't do this.,There will be havoc in the markets again.",I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,,we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people." 
 Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.,We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,,but we remain challenged.,If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,,well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,,and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination,if not a lack of compassion.,So far, we've thrown economics at the problem,,actually mostly austerity,,and certainly we could have designed alternatives,,a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,,or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would,support countries in need from market pressures,,these would have been much more viable alternatives.,Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much,one of economics as it is one of democracy. 
 So let's try something else.,Let's see how we can bring people back to the process.,Let's throw democracy at the problem.,Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,,believed in the wisdom of the crowd,at their best moments. In people we trust.,Democracy could not work without the citizens,deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities,for public affairs.,Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries,to decide on critical matters of the day.,Science, theater, research, philosophy,,games of the mind and the body,,they were daily exercises.,Actually they were an education for participation,,for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens. 
 And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.,You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,,that term originated there.,"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.,A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,,someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.,And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,,both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.,You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,,accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.,They serve the demos, democracy.,Above government, above markets,was the direct rule of the people. 
 Today we have globalized the markets,but we have not globalized our democratic institutions.,So our politicians are limited to local politics,,while our citizens, even though they see a great potential,,are prey to forces beyond their control. 
 So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?,How do we democratize globalization?,And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms,of the United Nations or the G20.,I'm talking about, how do we secure the space,,the demos, the platform of values,,so that we can tap into all of your potential? 
 Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.,Europe, despite its recent failures,,is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.,So let's see if it can't be an experiment,in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.,Let's see if we can't design a European agora,,not simply for products and services,,but for our citizens, where they can work together,,deliberate, learn from each other,,exchange between art and cultures,,where they can come up with creative solutions.,Let's imagine that European citizens,actually have the power to vote directly,for a European president,,or citizen juries chosen by lottery,which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,,a European-wide referendum where our citizens,,as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.,And here's an idea:,Why not have the first truly European citizens,by giving our immigrants,,not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,,but a European citizenship?,And make sure we actually empower,the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship,where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.,Where our common identity is democracy,,where our education is through participation,,and where participation builds trust,and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.,Europe of and by the people,,a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening,democracy beyond borders. 
 Now, some might accuse me of being naive,,putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.,Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.,Believe me, I have been,,I am, part of today's political system,,and I know things must change.,We must revive politics as the power to imagine,,reimagine, and redesign for a better world. 
 But I also know that this disruptive force of change,won't be driven by the politics of today.,The revival of democratic politics,will come from you, and I mean all of you.,Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,,whether it's here in this room,or just outside this room,or online or locally, where everybody lives,,everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality,,everybody who stands up to those who preach,racism rather than empathy,,dogma rather than critical thinking,,technocracy rather than democracy,,everyone who stands up to the unchecked power,,whether it's authoritarian leaders,,plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,,or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few. 
 It is in their interest that all of us are idiots.,Let's not be. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership,that is kind of unprepared,and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,,and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,,as a citizen, is terrifying.,Help us understand how you felt after the decision.,It was not a good decision, clearly,,but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,,but as George? 
 George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints,which didn't allow me or others to make,the types of decisions we would have wanted,,and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time,to make the reforms which would have dealt,with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit,which was the symptom of the problem.,And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,,hurt the younger generation, and not only,,many of them are demonstrating outside,,but I think this is one of our problems.,When we face these crises, we have kept the potential,,the huge potential of our society out of this process,,and we are closing in on ourselves in politics,,and I think we need to change that, to really find,new participatory ways using the great capabilities,that now exist even in technology but not only in technology,,the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions,which are much better, but we have to be open. 
 BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward,is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse,right now in most European countries.,It's rather the other way -- more closed borders,and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out,of some of the different parts of the European construction.,How do you reconcile that? 
 GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened,during this crisis is that we started a blame game.,And the fundamental idea of Europe is that,we can cooperate beyond borders,,go beyond our conflicts and work together.,And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,,we have less the potential to convince our citizens,that we should work together,,while now is the time when we really need,to bring our powers together. 
 Now, more Europe for me is not simply,giving more power to Brussels.,It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,,that is, really making Europe a project of the people.,So that, I think, would be a way to answer,some of the fears that we have in our society. 
 BG: George, thank you for coming to TED. 
 GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)Hetain Patel: (In Chinese) 
 Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.,And this is Yuyu,,who is a dancer I have been working with.,I have asked her to translate for me. 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 YR: If I may, I would like to tell you,a little bit about myself,and my artwork. 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,,in England,,but I'm not going to say it in English to you,,because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions,that might be made from my northern accent. 
 (Laughter) 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 YR: The only problem with masking it,with Chinese Mandarin,is I can only speak this paragraph,,which I have learned by heart,when I was visiting in China. (Laughter),So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones,and hope you won't notice. 
 (Laughter) 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 (Laughter) 
 YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize,to any Mandarin speakers in the audience. 
 As a child, I would hate being made,to wear the Indian kurta pajama,,because I didn't think it was very cool.,It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,,and it had this baggy trouser part,you had to tie really tight,to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.,My dad never wore it,,so I didn't see why I had to.,Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,,that people assume I represent something,genuinely Indian when I wear it,,because that's not how I feel. 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable,wearing it is by pretending,they are the robes of a kung fu warrior,like Li Mu Bai from that film,,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." 
 (Music) 
 Okay.,So my artwork is about identity and language,,challenging common assumptions,based on how we look like or where we come from,,gender, race, class.,What makes us who we are anyway? 
 HP: (In Chinese) 
 YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,,watch kung fu movies,,take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.,He would say things like -- 
 HP: Empty your mind.,(Laughter),Be formless, shapeless, like water.,Now you put water into a cup.,It becomes the cup.,You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.,Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.,Now, water can flow,or it can crash.,Be water, my friend. (Applause) 
 YR: This year, I am 32 years old,,the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.,I have been wondering recently,,if he were alive today,,what advice he would give me,about making this TED Talk. 
 HP: Don't imitate my voice.,It offends me. 
 (Laughter) 
 YR: Good advice,,but I still think that we learn who we are,by copying others.,Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero,in the playground, or mum or father?,I have. 
 HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video,for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair,so that I could grow it back as my father had it,when he first emigrated from India,to the U.K. in the 1960s.,He had a side parting and a neat mustache. 
 At first, it was going very well.,I even started to get discounts in Indian shops. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then very quickly,,I started to underestimate,my mustache growing ability,,and it got way too big.,It didn't look Indian anymore.,Instead, people from across the road,,they would shout things like -- 
 HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale! 
 (Laughter) 
 HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.,My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.,He talks like this now. 
 So it's not just my father that I've imitated.,A few years ago I went to China for a few months,,and I couldn't speak Chinese,,and this frustrated me,,so I wrote about this and had it translated,into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,,like music, I guess. 
 YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind,clearer than the pin number to my bank card,,so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.,When I had learned this phrase,,I had an artist over there hear me out,to see how accurate it sounded. 
 I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed,and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,,only it kind of sounds like a woman." 
 I said, "What?" 
 He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?" 
 I said, "Yes. So?" 
 He then explained the tonal differences,between male and female voices,are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,,but in a woman's voice. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 HP: Okay. So this imitation business,does come with risk.,It doesn't always go as you plan it,,even with a talented translator.,But I am going to stick with it,,because contrary to what we might usually assume,,imitating somebody can reveal something unique.,So every time I fail,to become more like my father,,I become more like myself.,Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,,I become more authentically me. 
 This is my art.,I strive for authenticity,,even if it comes in a shape,that we might not usually expect.,It's only recently that I've started to understand,that I didn't learn to sit like this,through being Indian.,I learned this from Spider-Man. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I am going to teach you,how to play my favorite game:,massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.,It's the only game in the world that I know of,that allows you, the player,,the opportunity to experience,10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.,This is true, so if you play this game with me today,for just one single minute,,you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,,pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,,contentment, and creativity,,all in the span of one minute. 
 So this sounds pretty good, right?nNow you're willing to play.,In order to teach you this game,,I'm going to need some volunteers,to come up onstage really quickly,,and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.,While they're coming up, I should let you know,,this game was invented 10 years ago,by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.,So thank you, Monochrom.,Okay, so most people are familiar,with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.,Sunni, let's just remind them.,One, two, three, four, nI declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,,and of course Sunni beats menbecause she's the best. 
 Now the first thing aboutnmassively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,,we're the gamer generation.,There are a billion gamers on the planet now,,so we need more of a challenge.,So the first thing we need is more thumbs.,So Eric, come on over.,So we could get three thumbs together,,and Peter could join us.,We could even have four thumbs together,,and the way you win,is you're the first personnto pin someone else's thumb.,This is really important. You can't, like,,wait while they fight it out andnthen swoop in at the last minute.,That is not how you win.,Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.,So Eric would have won. He wasnthe first person to pin my thumb.,Okay, so that's the first rule,,and we can see that three or four,is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,,but if you feel ambitious,nyou don't have to hold back.,We can really go for it.,So you can see up here.,Now the only other rule you need to remember is,,gamer generation, we like a challenge.,I happen to notice you all have,some thumbs you're not using.,So I think we should kind of get some more involved.,And if we had just four people,,we would do it just like this,,and we would try and wrestle,both thumbs at the same time.,Perfect. 
 Now, if we had more people in the room,,instead of just wrestling in a closed node,,we might reach out and trynand grab some other people.,And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.,We're going to try and get all, something like,,I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room,connected in a single node.,And we have to connect both levels,,so if you're up there, you're going to be,reaching down and reaching up. 
 Now — (Laughter) —,before we get started --,This is great. You're excited to play. —,before we get started, can I haventhe slides back up here really quick,,because if you get good at this game,,I want you to know there are some advanced levels.,So this is the kind of simple level, right?,But there are advanced configurations.,This is called the Death Star Configuration.,Any Star Wars fans?,And this one's called the Möbius Strip.,Any science geeks, you get that one.,This is the hardest level. This is the extreme. 
 So we'll stick with the normal one for now,,and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,,every thumb into the node,,connect the upper and the lower levels,,you guys go on down there.,Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node. 
 Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.,Everybody, up up up up up!,Stand up, my friends.,All right.,Don't start wrestling yet.,If you have a free thumb, wave it around,,make sure it gets connected.,Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.,If you have a free thumb,nwave it around to make sure.,Grab that thumb!,Reach behind you. There you go.,Any other thumbs?,Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.,Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.,Okay? One, two, three, go! 
 (Laughter) 
 Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!,(Applause),Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 All right.,While you are basking in the glow,of having won your first,massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,,let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.,So curiosity.,I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.",You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?",So I provoked a little curiosity.,Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem,of getting all the thumbs into the node.,I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.,So you used creativity. That was great.,How about surprise? The actual feeling,of trying to wrestle two thumbs at oncenis pretty surprising.,You heard that sound go up in the room.,We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,,maybe you're starting to winnor this person's, like, really into it,,so you kind of get the excitement going.,We have relief. You got to stand up.,You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,,getting to shake it out.,We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.nLook at your faces. This room is full of joy.,We had some contentment.,I didn't see anybody sending text messagesnor checking their email while we were playing,,so you were totally content to be playing.,The most important three emotions,,awe and wonder, we had everybodynconnected physically for a minute.,When was the last time you were at TED,and you got to connect physicallynwith every single person in the room?,And it's truly awesome and wondrous.,And speaking of physical connection,,you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,,you release oxytocin, you feel bondednto everyone in the room.,You guys know that the best waynto release oxytocin quickly,is to hold someone else's handnfor at least six seconds.,You guys were all holding handsnfor way more than six seconds,,so we are all now biochemically primed,to love each other. That is great. 
 And the last emotion of pride.,How many people are like me. Just admit it.,You lost both your thumbs.,It just didn't work out for you.,That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.,You learned, from scratch,na game you never knew before.,Now you know how to play it.nYou can teach other people.,So congratulations.,How many of you won just won thumb?,All right. I have very good news for you.,According to the official rules,of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,,this makes you a grandmaster of the game.,Because there aren't that manynpeople who know how to play,,we have to kind of accelerate the program,more than a game like chess.,So congratulations, grandmasters.,Win one thumb once, you willnbecome a grandmaster.,Did anybody win both their thumbs?,Yes. Awesome. Okay.,Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.,You guys, according to the rules,,are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.,I will just leave you with this tip,nif you want to play again.,The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,,you've got your two nodes going on.,Pick off the one that looks easiest.,They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.,Focus on that one and do something crazy,with this arm.,As soon as you win, suddenly stop.,Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.,That's how you become a legendary grandmasternof massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.,Thank you for letting menteach you my favorite game.,Wooo! (Applause),Thank you. (Applause)Living in Africa is to be on the edge,,metaphorically, and quite literally,when you think about connectivity before 2008.,Though many human intellectual and technological leaps,had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,,but Africa was sort of cut off.,And that changed, first with ships,when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution,and also the Industrial Revolution.,And now we've got the digital revolution.,These revolutions have not been evenly distributed,across continents and nations.,Never have been. 
 Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables,that connect Africa to the rest of the world.,What I find amazing is that Africa,is transcending its geography problem.,Africa is connecting to the rest of the world,and within itself.,The connectivity situation has improved greatly,,but some barriers remain.,It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be. 
 In 2008, one of the problems that we faced,was lack of information flow.,There was a media blackout in 2008,,when there was post-election violence in Kenya.,It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.,So we came together and we created software,called Ushahidi.,And Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.,I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.,This is David and Erik.,I call them brothers from another mother.,Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.,And we worked together first with building,and growing Ushahidi.,And the idea of the software was to gather information,from SMS, email and web, and put a map,so that you could see what was happening where,,and you could visualize that data.,And after that initial prototype,,we set out to make free and open-source software,so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did. 
 All the while, we also wanted to give back,to the local tech community that helped us,grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.,And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,,an actual physical space,where we could collaborate,,and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.,We did that with the support of different organizations,like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network. 
 And we were able to grow this software footprint,,and a few years later it became,very useful software,,and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti,where citizens could indicate where they are,and what their needs were,,and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis,and the tsunami in Japan.,Now, this year the Internet turns 20,,and Ushahidi turned five. 
 Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.,It is the team, and it's also the community,that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.,We did not imagine that there would be this many maps,around the world.,There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,,and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.,We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya,and that it has some use to people around the world,trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.,There is more that we're doing to explore this idea,of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,,if I share the information with whatever device that I have,,could inform you about what is going on,,and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture,of what's going on. 
 I moved back to Kenya in 2011.,Erik moved in 2010.,Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago,where there was abundant Internet access.,I had never had to deal with a blackout.,And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,,and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress,and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.,The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this,can be, let's just say very annoying.,Blackouts are not fun.,Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden,the power goes out,,your Internet connection goes down with it,,so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,,how do I switch back?,And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.,Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,,and other parts of Africa. 
 The other problem that we're facing,is that communication costs are also still a challenge.,It costs me five Kenyan shillings,,or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.,Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?,Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost,to connect within Africa.,And also, when traveling within Africa,,you've got different settings for different mobile providers.,This is the reality that we deal with. 
 So we've got a joke in Ushahidi,where we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere.",[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.],What if we could overcome the problem,of unreliable Internet and electricity,and reduce the cost of connection?,Could we leverage the cloud?,We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.,Could we leverage these technologies,to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country? 
 So we looked at the modem,,an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,,and asked ourselves why,the modems that we are using right now,are built for a different context, where you've got,ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,,yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.,We wanted to redesign the modem,for the developing world, for our context,,and for our reality.,What if we could have connectivity with less friction? 
 This is the BRCK.,It acts as a backup to the Internet,so that, when the power goes out,,it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.,Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.,It's actually everywhere.,Most towns at least have a 3G connection.,So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.,The other reason that we built this,is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours,of battery left, so you can continue working,,you can continue being productive,,and let's just say you are less stressed.,And for rural areas, it can be,the primary means of connection. 
 The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play,when we wondered how can we use the cloud,to be more intelligent so that,you can analyze the different networks,,and whenever you switch on the backup,,you pick on the fastest network,,so we'll have multi-SIM capability,so that you can put multiple SIMs,,and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,,and if the up time on that is not very good,,then you hop onto the next one.,The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.,With load balancing, this can be possible. 
 The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --,is this idea that you could have an on-ramp,for the Internet of things.,Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.,It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach,a satellite module so that you could have,Internet connectivity even in very remote areas. 
 Out of adversity can come innovation,,and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers,in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?,And for us, we begin with solving the problem,in our own backyard in Kenya. 
 It is not without challenge.,Our team has basically been mules carrying components,from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations,with customs border agents.,"What are you carrying?",And the local financing is not,part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.,So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,,through the support of many people,,not only here but online,,the BRCK has been Kickstarted,,and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins. 
 I will close by saying that, if we solve this,for the local market, it could be impactful,not only for the coders in Nairobi,but also for small business owners,who need reliable connectivity,,and it can reduce the cost of connecting,,and hopefully collaboration within African countries. 
 The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy,are connectivity and entrepreneurship.,The BRCK is our part,to keep Africans connected,,and to help them drive the global digital revolution. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have a confession to make.,But first, I want you to makena little confession to me.,In the past year,nI want you to just raise your hand,if you've experiencednrelatively little stress.,Anyone? 
 How about a moderate amount of stress? 
 Who has experienced a lot of stress?,Yeah. Me too. 
 But that is not my confession.,My confession is this:,I am a health psychologist,,and my mission is to help peoplenbe happier and healthier.,But I fear that somethingnI've been teaching,for the last 10 yearsnis doing more harm than good,,and it has to do with stress.,For years I've been telling people,nstress makes you sick.,It increases the risk of everythingnfrom the common cold,to cardiovascular disease.,Basically, I've turned stressninto the enemy.,But I have changed my mind about stress,,and today, I want to change yours. 
 Let me start with the studynthat made me rethink,my whole approach to stress.,This study tracked 30,000 adultsnin the United States for eight years,,and they started by asking people,,"How much stress have younexperienced in the last year?",They also asked,,"Do you believe that stressnis harmful for your health?",And then they used public death recordsnto find out who died. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay.,Some bad news first.,People who experienced a lot of stressnin the previous year,had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.,But that was only true for the people,who also believed that stressnis harmful for your health. 
 (Laughter) 
 People who experienced a lot of stress,but did not view stress as harmful,were no more likely to die.,In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying,of anyone in the study,,including peoplenwho had relatively little stress. 
 Now the researchers estimatednthat over the eight years,they were tracking deaths,,182,000 Americans died prematurely,,not from stress,,but from the beliefnthat stress is bad for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 That is over 20,000 deaths a year.,Now, if that estimate is correct,,that would makenbelieving stress is bad for you,the 15th largest cause of deathnin the United States last year,,killing more people than skin cancer,nHIV/AIDS and homicide. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can see why this study freaked me out.,Here I've been spendingnso much energy telling people,stress is bad for your health. 
 So this study got me wondering:,Can changing how you thinknabout stress make you healthier?,And here the science says yes.,When you change your mind about stress,,you can changenyour body's response to stress. 
 Now to explain how this works,,I want you all to pretendnthat you are participants,in a study designed to stress you out.,It's called the social stress test.,You come into the laboratory,,and you're told you have to give,a five-minute impromptu speechnon your personal weaknesses,to a panel of expert evaluatorsnsitting right in front of you,,and to make sure you feel the pressure,,there are bright lightsnand a camera in your face,,kind of like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the evaluators have been trained,to give you discouraging,nnon-verbal feedback,,like this. 
 (Exhales) 
 (Laughter) 
 Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,,time for part two: a math test.,And unbeknownst to you,,the experimenter has been trainednto harass you during it.,Now we're going to all do this together.,It's going to be fun.,For me. 
 Okay. 
 (Laughter) 
 I want you all to count backwards from 996,in increments of seven.,You're going to do this out loud,,as fast as you can,,starting with 996.,Go! 
 (Audience counting) 
 Go faster. Faster please.,You're going too slow. 
 (Audience counting) 
 Stop. Stop, stop, stop.,That guy made a mistake.,We are going to have to startnall over again. 
 (Laughter) 
 You're not very good at this, are you?,Okay, so you get the idea.,If you were actually in this study,,you'd probably be a little stressed out.,Your heart might be pounding,,you might be breathing faster,nmaybe breaking out into a sweat.,And normally, we interpretnthese physical changes as anxiety,or signs that we aren't copingnvery well with the pressure. 
 But what if you viewed them instead,as signs that your body was energized,,was preparing you to meet this challenge?,Now that is exactlynwhat participants were told,in a study conductednat Harvard University.,Before they wentnthrough the social stress test,,they were taught to rethinkntheir stress response as helpful.,That pounding heartnis preparing you for action.,If you're breathing faster,nit's no problem.,It's getting more oxygen to your brain.,And participants who learned to viewnthe stress response,as helpful for their performance,,well, they were less stressed out,nless anxious, more confident,,but the most fascinating finding to me,was how their physicalnstress response changed. 
 Now, in a typical stress response,,your heart rate goes up,,and your blood vesselsnconstrict like this.,And this is one of the reasonsnthat chronic stress,is sometimes associatednwith cardiovascular disease.,It's not really healthy to benin this state all the time.,But in the study,,when participants viewedntheir stress response as helpful,,their blood vesselsnstayed relaxed like this.,Their heart was still pounding,,but this is a much healthierncardiovascular profile.,It actually looks a lot like what happens,in moments of joy and courage.,Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,,this one biological change,could be the difference,between a stress-inducednheart attack at age 50,and living well into your 90s.,And this is really what the newnscience of stress reveals,,that how you think about stress matters. 
 So my goal as a healthnpsychologist has changed.,I no longer wantnto get rid of your stress.,I want to make you better at stress.,And we just did a little intervention.,If you raised your hand and said,you'd had a lot of stressnin the last year,,we could have saved your life,,because hopefully the next timenyour heart is pounding from stress,,you're going to remember this talk,and you're going to think to yourself,,this is my body helping menrise to this challenge.,And when you view stress in that way,,your body believes you,,and your stress responsenbecomes healthier. 
 Now I said I have over a decadenof demonizing stress,to redeem myself from,,so we are going to donone more intervention.,I want to tell you,about one of the most under-appreciatednaspects of the stress response,,and the idea is this:,Stress makes you social. 
 To understand this side of stress,,we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,,and I know oxytocin has already gottennas much hype as a hormone can get.,It even has its own cute nickname,nthe cuddle hormone,,because it's releasednwhen you hug someone.,But this is a very small partnof what oxytocin is involved in. 
 Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.,It fine-tunesnyour brain's social instincts.,It primes you to do things,that strengthen close relationships.,Oxytocin makes you crave physical contactnwith your friends and family.,It enhances your empathy.,It even makes you more willingnto help and support,the people you care about.,Some people have even suggestednwe should snort oxytocin...,to become more compassionate and caring.,But here's what most peoplendon't understand about oxytocin.,It's a stress hormone.,Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out,as part of the stress response.,It's as much a partnof your stress response,as the adrenaline that makesnyour heart pound.,And when oxytocin is releasednin the stress response,,it is motivating you to seek support.,Your biological stress response,is nudging you to tellnsomeone how you feel,,instead of bottling it up.,Your stress response wantsnto make sure you notice,when someone elsenin your life is struggling,so that you can support each other.,When life is difficult,,your stress response wants younto be surrounded,by people who care about you. 
 Okay, so how is knowing this sidenof stress going to make you healthier?,Well, oxytocin doesn't only actnon your brain.,It also acts on your body,,and one of its main roles in your body,is to protect your cardiovascular systemnfrom the effects of stress.,It's a natural anti-inflammatory.,It also helps your blood vesselsnstay relaxed during stress.,But my favorite effect on the bodynis actually on the heart.,Your heart has receptors for this hormone,,and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate,and heal from any stress-induced damage.,This stress hormonenstrengthens your heart. 
 And the cool thingnis that all of these physical benefits,of oxytocin are enhancednby social contact and social support.,So when you reach outnto others under stress,,either to seek supportnor to help someone else,,you release more of this hormone,,your stress response becomes healthier,,and you actually recovernfaster from stress.,I find this amazing,,that your stress responsenhas a built-in mechanism,for stress resilience,,and that mechanism is human connection. 
 I want to finish by telling younabout one more study.,And listen up, because this studyncould also save a life.,This study tracked about 1,000 adultsnin the United States,,and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,,and they started the study by asking,,"How much stress have younexperienced in the last year?",They also asked,,"How much time have you spentnhelping out friends, neighbors,,people in your community?",And then they used public recordsnfor the next five years,to find out who died. 
 Okay, so the bad news first:,For every major stressful life experience,,like financial difficultiesnor family crisis,,that increased the risknof dying by 30 percent.,But -- and I hope younare expecting a "but" by now --,but that wasn't true for everyone.,People who spent time caring for others,showed absolutely no stress-relatednincrease in dying.,Zero.,Caring created resilience. 
 And so we see once again,that the harmful effectsnof stress on your health,are not inevitable.,How you think and how you act,can transform your experience of stress.,When you choose to viewnyour stress response as helpful,,you create the biology of courage.,And when you choose to connectnwith others under stress,,you can create resilience.,Now I wouldn't necessarily asknfor more stressful experiences in my life,,but this science has given mena whole new appreciation for stress.,Stress gives us access to our hearts.,The compassionate heartnthat finds joy and meaning,in connecting with others,,and yes, your pounding physical heart,,working so hard to give younstrength and energy.,And when you choose to viewnstress in this way,,you're not just getting better at stress,,you're actually makingna pretty profound statement.,You're saying that you can trust yourselfnto handle life's challenges.,And you're rememberingnthat you don't have to face them alone. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: This is kindnof amazing, what you're telling us.,It seems amazing to menthat a belief about stress,can make so much differencento someone's life expectancy.,How would that extend to advice,,like, if someone is makingna lifestyle choice,between, say, a stressful jobnand a non-stressful job,,does it matter which way they go?,It's equally wise to gonfor the stressful job,so long as you believenthat you can handle it, in some sense? 
 KM: Yeah, and one thingnwe know for certain,is that chasing meaningnis better for your health,than trying to avoid discomfort.,And so I would say that's reallynthe best way to make decisions,,is go after what it isnthat creates meaning in your life,and then trust yourself to handlenthe stress that follows. 
 CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.nIt's pretty cool. 
 (Applause)When we think of Nepal,,we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains,of the Himalayas,,the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,,or the huge expanse of its grasslands.,What some of us may not realize,is that in the Himalayan foothills,,where the climate is much warmer,and the landscape much greener,,there lives a great diversity of wildlife,,including the one-horned rhinoceros,,the Asian elephant,and the Bengal tiger.,But unfortunately, these animals,are under constant threat from poachers,who hunt and kill them for their body parts.,To stop the killing of these animals,,battalions of soldiers and rangers,are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,,but that is not an easy task,,because these soldiers have to patrol,thousands of hectares of forests on foot,or elephant backs.,It is also risky for these soldiers,when they get into gunfights with poachers,,and therefore Nepal is always looking,for new ways to help with protecting the forests,and wildlife. 
 Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool,in the fight against wildlife crime,,and these are drones,,or more specifically, conservation drones.,For about a year now, my colleagues and I,have been building drones for Nepal,and training the park protection personnel,on the use of these drones.,Not only does a drone give you,a bird's-eye view of the landscape,,but it also allows you to capture detailed,,high-resolution images of objects on the ground.,This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros,taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day,in the lowlands of Nepal.,Now we believe that drones have,tremendous potential,,not only for combating wildlife crime,,but also for monitoring the health,of these wildlife populations. 
 So what is a drone?,Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about,is simply a model aircraft,fitted with an autopilot system,,and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,,a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter,and a few other sensors.,Now a drone like this,is meant to carry a useful payload,,such as a video camera,or a photographic camera.,It also requires a software that allows the user,to program a mission,,to tell the drone where to go. 
 Now people I talk to are often surprised,when they hear that these are the only,four components that make a conservation drone,,but they are even more surprised,when I tell them how affordablenthese components are.,The facts is, a conservation drone,doesn't cost very much more than,a good laptop computer,or a decent pair of binoculars. 
 So now that you've builtnyour own conservation drone,,you probably want to go fly it,,but how does one fly a drone?,Well, actually, you don't,,because the drone flies itself.,All you have to do is to program a mission,to tell the drone where to fly.,But you simply do that by clicking on,a few way points on the Google Maps interface,using the open-source software.,Those missions could be as simple,as just a few way points,,or they could be slightly longernand more complicated,,to fly along a river system.,Sometimes, we fly the dronenin a lawnmower-type pattern,and take pictures of that area,,and those pictures can be processed,to produce a map of that forest.,Other researchers might want to fly the drone,along the boundaries of a forest,to watch out for poachers or people,who might be trying to enter the forest illegally. 
 Now whatever your mission is,,once you've programmed it,,you simply upload it to the autopilot system,,bring your drone to the field,,and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.,And often we'll go about this mission,taking pictures or videos along the way,,and usually at that point,,we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,,sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,,although some of us sit backnand panic for the next few minutes,worrying that the drone will not return.,Usually it does, and when it does,,it even lands automatically. 
 So what can we do with a conservation drone?,Well, when we built our first prototype drone,,our main objective was to fly it over,a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,,to look for the nest of a species of great ape,known as the orangutan.,The reason we wanted to do that was because,we needed to know how many individuals,of this species are still left in that forest.,Now the traditional method of surveying,for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot,carrying heavy equipment,and to use a pair of binocularsnto look up in the treetops,where you might find an orangutan or its nest.,Now as you can imagine,,that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,,and costly process,,so we were hoping that drones,could significantly reduce the cost of surveying,for orangutan populations in Indonesia,and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.,So we were very excited when we captured,our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.,And this is it; this is the first ever picture,of orangutan nests taken with a drone.,Since then we have taken pictures,of dozens of these nests,from around various parts of Southeast Asia,,and we're now working with computer scientists,to develop algorithms that can automatically count,the number of nests from the thousands,of photos we've collected so far. 
 But nests are not the only objects,these drones can detect.,This is a wild orangutan,happily feeding on top of a palm tree,,seemingly oblivious to our dronenthat was flying overhead,,not once but several times.,We've also taken pictures of other animals,including forest buffalos in Gabon,,elephants, and even turtle nests. 
 But besides taking picturesnof just the animals themselves,,we also take pictures of the habitatsnthese animals live in,,because we want to keep track,of the health of these habitats.,Sometimes, we zoom out a little,and look at other things that might be happening,in the landscape.,This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.,Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation,in that part of the world,,so we wanted to use this new drone technology,to keep track of the spread of these plantations,in Southeast Asia.,But drones could also be used to keep track of,illegal logging activities.,This is a recently logged forest,,again in Sumatra.,You could even still see the processed,wooden planks left on the ground. 
 But perhaps the most exciting part,about taking pictures from the air is,we could later stitch these pictures together,using special software to create a map,of the entire landscape, and this map,gives us crucial information,for monitoring land use change,,to let us know where and whennplantations might be expanding,,where forests might be contracting,,or where fires might be breaking out.,Aerial images could also be processed,to produce three-dimensional,computer models of forests.,Now these models are not just visually appealing,,but they are also geometrically accurate,,which means researchers can now measure,the distance between trees,,calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,,and so on, all of which are important information,for monitoring the health of these forests.,Recently, we've also begun experimenting,with thermal imaging cameras.,Now these cameras can detect,heat-emitting objects from the ground,,and therefore they are very usefulnfor detecting poachers or their campfires at night. 
 So I've told you quite a lot about,what conservation drones are,,how you might operate one of these drones,,and what a drone could do for you.,I will now tell you where conservation drones,are being used around the world.,We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.,We brought a few of these to Indonesia,for the first few test flights.,Since then, we've been building drones,for our collaborators from around the world,,and these include fellow biologists,and partners from major conservation organizations. 
 Perhaps the best and most rewarding part,about working with these collaborators,is the feedback they give us,on how to improve our drones.,Building drones for us is,a constant work in progress.,We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of,their range, their ruggedness,,and the amount of payload they can carry.,We also work with collaborators,to discover new ways of using these drones.,For example, camera traps are a common tool,used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals,hiding in the forests,,but these are motion-activated cameras,,so they snap a picture every time an animal,crosses their path.,But the problem with camera traps,is that the researcher has to go back to the forest,every so often to retrieve those images,,and that takes a lot of time,,especially if there are dozens,or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.,Now a drone could be designed to perform the task,much more efficiently.,This drone, carrying a special sensor,,could be flown over the forest,and remotely download these images,from wi-fi–enabled cameras. 
 Radio collars are another tool,that's commonly used by biologists.,Now these collars are put onto animals.,They transmit a radio signal which allows,the researcher to track the movementsnof these animals across the landscape.,But the traditional way of tracking animals,is pretty ridiculous,,because it requires the researcher to be walking,on the ground carrying a hugenand cumbersome radio antenna,,not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have,on our rooftops. Some of us still do.,A drone could be used to do the same job,much more efficiently.,Why not equip a drone,with a scanning radio receiver,,fly that over the forest canopy,in a certain pattern,which would allow the user or the operator,to triangulate the location,of these radio-collared animals remotely,without having to step foot in the forest. 
 A third and perhaps most exciting way,of using these drones,is to fly them to a really remote,,never-explored-before rainforest,somewhere hidden in the tropics,,and parachute down a tiny spy microphone,that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls,of mammals, birds, amphibians,,the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.,That would give us biologists,a pretty good idea of what animals,might be living in those forests. 
 And finally, I would like to show you,the latest version of our conservation drone.,The MAJA drone has a wingspan,of about two meters.,It weighs only about two kilograms,,but it can carry half its weight.,It is a fully autonomous system.,During its mission, it can even transmit,a live video feed back to a ground station laptop,,which allows the user,to see what the drone is seeing in real time.,It carries a variety of sensors,,and the photo quality of some of these sensors,can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.,This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,,which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.,That is quite sufficient for most,of our conservation applications. 
 Now, conservation drones began as,a crazy idea from two biologists,who are just deeply passionatenabout this technology.,And we believe, strongly believe,,that drones can and will be a game changer,for conservation research and applications.,We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics,who thought that we were justnfooling around with toy planes.,And in a way, they are right.,I mean, let's be honest,,drones are the ultimate toys for boys.,But at the same time, we've also gotten to know,many wonderful colleagues and collaborators,who share our vision,and see the potential of conservation drones.,To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists,and practitioners should make full use,of every available tool, including drones,,in our fight to save the last remaining forests,and wildlife of this planet. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.,You know that all over the world,,people fight for their freedom,,fight for their rights.,Some battle oppressive governments.,Others battle oppressive societies.,Which battle do you think is harder?,Allow me to try to answer this question,in the few coming minutes. 
 Let me take you back two years ago in my life.,It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.,He was five at the time.,After finishing his bedtime rituals,,he looked at me and he asked a question:,"Mommy, are we bad people?" 
 I was shocked.,"Why do you say such things, Aboody?" 
 Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises,on his face when he came from school.,He wouldn't tell me what happened.,[But now] he was ready to tell. 
 "Two boys hit me today in school.,They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.,You and your mom should be put in jail.'" 
 I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.,I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.,But those questioning eyes of my son,were my moment of truth,,when it all came together.,You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail,for driving a car in a country,where women are not supposed to drive cars.,Just for giving me his car keys,,my own brother was detained twice,,and he was harassed to the point he had,to quit his job as a geologist,,leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.,My father had to sit in a Friday sermon,listening to the imam condemning women drivers,and calling them prostitutes,amongst tons of worshippers,,some of them our friends and family of my own father.,I was faced with an organized defamation campaign,in the local media combined with false rumors,shared in family gatherings, in the streets,and in schools.,It all hit me.,It came into focus that those kids,did not mean to be rude to my son.,They were just influenced by the adults around them.,And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment,for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.,It was a punishment for daring to challenge,the society's rules. 
 But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.,Allow me to give you a briefing,about my story.,It was May, 2011,,and I was complaining to a work colleague,about the harassments I had to face,trying to find a ride back home,,although I have a car and an international driver's license.,As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia,have been always complaining about the ban,,but it's been 20 years since anyone,tried to do anything about it,,a whole generation ago. 
 He broke the good/bad news in my face.,"But there is no law banning you from driving." 
 I looked it up, and he was right.,There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.,It was just a custom and traditions,that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas,and imposed on women.,That realization ignited the idea of June 17,,where we encouraged women to take the wheel,and go drive.,It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these,"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive.",A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,,she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,,she drove a car and she announced,but she didn't record a video.,We needed proof. 
 So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.,And to my surprise,,it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.,What happened next, of course?,I started receiving threats,to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign. 
 The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.,That really creeped us out.,I was in the campaign with other Saudi women,and even men activists.,We wanted to know how the authorities,would respond on the actual day, June 17,,when women go out and drive.,So this time I asked my brother,to come with me and drive by a police car.,It went fast. We were arrested,,signed a pledge not to drive again, released.,Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,,and I was sent to jail.,I wasn't sure why I was sent there,,because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.,But what I was sure of was my innocence.,I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya,— it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house —,and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,,but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,,"No, I'm leaving today.",Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,,some attacking me badly,,and others supportive and even collecting signatures,in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.,I was released after nine days. 
 June 17 comes.,The streets were packed with police cars,and religious police cars,,but some hundred brave Saudi women,broke the ban and drove that day.,None were arrested. We broke the taboo. 
 (Applause) 
 So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,,or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,,but maybe few know why.,Allow me to help you answer this question. 
 There was this official study,that was presented to the Shura Council --,it's the consultative council appointed,by the king in Saudi Arabia —,and it was done by a local professor,,a university professor.,He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.,And the study states,,the percentage of rape, adultery,,illegitimate children, even drug abuse,,prostitution in countries where women drive,is higher than countries where women don't drive. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know, I was like this, I was shocked.,I was like, "We are the last country in the world,where women don't drive.",So if you look at the map of the world,,that only leaves two countries:,Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world. 
 We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,,and it made headlines around the world. 
 [BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns] 
 (Laughter) 
 And only then we realized it's so empowering,to mock your oppressor.,It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear. 
 This system is based on ultra-conservative,traditions and customs,that deal with women as if they are inferior,and they need a guardian to protect them,,so they need to take permission from this guardian,,whether verbal or written, all their lives.,We are minors until the day we die.,And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas,based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,,or the religious laws.,What's worst, when they become codified,as laws in the system,,and when women themselves believe in their inferiority,,and they even fight those who try,to question these rules. 
 So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.,It was about living two totally different,perceptions of my personality, of my person --,the villain back in my home country,,and the hero outside. 
 Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.,One of them is when I was in jail.,I'm pretty sure when I was in jail,,everyone saw titles in the international media,something like this during these nine days I was in jail. 
 But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.,It was more like this:,"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order,and inciting women to drive." 
 I know. 
 "Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign." 
 Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite. 
 "Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:,'Foreign forces incited me.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.,So it's a totally different picture. 
 I was asked last year to give a speech,at the Oslo Freedom Forum.,I was surrounded by this love,and the support of people around me,,and they looked at me as an inspiration.,At the same time, I flew back to my home country,,they hated that speech so much.,The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country,and the Saudi people,,and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.,Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,,while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,,there was like a handful of tweets written.,They even started a poll.,More than 13,000 voters answered this poll:,whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.,Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.,So it's these two totally different perceptions,of my personality. 
 For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,,and I do love my country,,and because I love my country, I'm doing this.,Because I believe a society will not be free,if the women of that society are not free.,(Applause),Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.,(Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.,I learned to be always there.,The first thing, I got out of jail,,of course after I took a shower, I went online,,I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,,and I've been always very respectful,to those people who are opining to me.,I would listen to what they say,,and I would never defend myself with words only.,I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,,I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate,of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.,There are a lot of people also --,very big support, like those 3,000 people,who signed the petition to release me.,We sent a petition to the Shura Council,in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,,and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that,and they signed that petition.,There were people like that, I just showed some examples,,who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,,and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate,because of speaking up and voicing their views. 
 Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps,toward enhancing women's rights.,The Shura Council that's appointed by the king,,by royal decree of King Abdullah,,last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,,like 20 percent.,20 percent of the Council. (Applause),The same time, finally, that Council,,after rejecting our petition four times for women driving,,they finally accepted it last February.,(Applause),After being sent to jail,or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,,the spokesperson of the traffic police said,,we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.,The Grand Mufti, who is the head,of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,,he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.,It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti. 
 So for me, it's not about only these small steps.,It's about women themselves. 
 A friend once asked me, she said,,"So when do you think this women driving will happen?" 
 I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?',and take action to make it now." 
 So it's not only about the system,,it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say. 
 So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.,And I don't know how I became one now.,But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future,when someone asks me my story,,I will say, "I'm proud,to be amongst those women who lifted the ban,,fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom." 
 So the question I started my talk with,,who do you think is more difficult to face,,oppressive governments or oppressive societies?,I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. 
 Thank you, everyone. 
 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you. (Applause)Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.,So he's Mario. He's our son.,He was born two and a half years ago,,and I had a pretty tough pregnancy,because I had to stay stillnin a bed for, like, eight months.,But in the end everythingnseemed to be under control.,So he got the right weight at birth.,He got the right Apgar index.,So we were pretty reassured by this.,But at the end, 10 daysnlater after he was born,,we discovered that he had a stroke.,As you might know,,a stroke is a brain injury.,A perinatal stroke could be something,that can happennduring the nine months of pregnancy,or just suddenly after the birth,,and in his case, as you can see,,the right part of his brain has gone.,So the effect that this strokencould have on Mario's body,could be the fact that he couldn'tnbe able to control,the left side of his body.,Just imagine, if you havena computer and a printer,and you want to transmit,nto input to print out a document,,but the printer doesn'tnhave the right drives,,so the same is for Mario.,It's just like,nhe would like to move his left side,of his body, but he's not ablento transmit the right input,to move his left arm and left leg.,So life had to change.,We needed to change our schedule.,We needed to change the impactnthat this birth had,on our life.,Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,,unfortunately, we were not ready.,Nobody taught us how to dealnwith such kinds of disabilities,,and as many questions as possible started,to come to our minds.,And that has been really a tough time.,Questions, some basics, like, you know,,why did this happen to us?,And what went wrong?,Some more tough, like, really,,what will be the impact on Mario's life?,I mean, at the end,nwill he be able to work?,Will he be able to be normal?,And, you know, as a parent,nespecially for the first time,,why is he not going to be better than us?,And this, indeed, really is tough to say,,but a few months later, we realized that,we were really feeling like a failure.,I mean, the only real product of our life,,at the end, was a failure.,And you know, it was not a failurenfor ourselves in itself,,but it was a failurenthat will impact his full life.,Honestly, we went down.,I mean we went reallyndown, but at the end,,we started to look at him,,and we said, we have to react.,So immediately, as Francescansaid, we changed our life.,We started physiotherapy,nwe started the rehabilitation,,and one of the pathsnthat we were following,in terms of rehabilitationnis the mirror neurons pilot.,Basically, we spent monthsndoing this with Mario.,You have an object, and we showed him,how to grab the object.,Now, the theory of mirrornneurons simply says,that in your brains, exactlynnow, as you watch me doing this,,you are activatingnexactly the same neurons,as if you do the actions.,It looks like this is the leadingnedge in terms of rehabilitation.,But one day we found that Mario,was not looking at our hand.,He was looking at us.,We were his mirror.,And the problem, as you might feel,,is that we were down, we were depressed,,we were looking at him as a problem,,not as a son, notnfrom a positive perspective.,And that day reallynchanged our perspective.,We realized that we had to become,a better mirror for Mario.,We restarted from our strengths,,and at the same timenwe restarted from his strengths.,We stopped looking at him as a problem,,and we started to look at himnas an opportunity to improve.,And really, this was the change,,and from our side, we said,,"What are our strengthsnthat we really can bring to Mario?",And we started from our passions.,I mean, at the end, my wife and myself,are quite different,,but we have many things in common.,We love to travel, we love music,,we love to be in places like this,,and we started to bring Mario with us,just to show to him the bestnthings that we can show to him.,This short video is from last week.,I am not saying --,(Applause) —,I am not saying it's a miracle.nThat's not the message,,because we are justnat the beginning of the path.,But we want to sharenwhat was the key learning,,the key learning that Mario drove to us,,and it is to considernwhat you have as a gift,and not only what you miss,,and to consider what younmiss just as an opportunity.,And this is the messagenthat we want to share with you.,This is why we are here.,Mario!,And this is why --,(Applause) —,And this is why,we decided to share the bestnmirror in the world with him.,And we thank you so much, all of you.,FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.,(Applause),FF: Thank you. (Applause)Three and a half years ago,,I made one of the best decisions of my life.,As my New Year's resolution,,I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,,and learned to eat mindfully.,Now I eat whenever I'm hungry,,and I've lost 10 pounds. 
 This was me at age 13,,when I started my first diet.,I look at that picture now, and I think,,you did not need a diet,,you needed a fashion consult.,(Laughter),But I thought I needed to lose weight,,and when I gained it back,,of course I blamed myself.,And for the next three decades,,I was on and off various diets.,No matter what I tried,,the weight I'd lost always came back.,I'm sure many of you know the feeling. 
 As a neuroscientist,,I wondered, why is this so hard?,Obviously, how much you weigh depends on,how much you eat and how much energy you burn.,What most people don't realize,is that hunger and energy use,are controlled by the brain,,mostly without your awareness.,Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,,and that is a good thing,,because your conscious mind --,how do we put this politely? --,it's easily distracted.,It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe,when you get caught up in a movie.,You don't forget how to walk,because you're thinking aboutnwhat to have for dinner. 
 Your brain also has its own sense,of what you should weigh,,no matter what you consciously believe.,This is called your set point,,but that's a misleading term,,because it's actually a range,of about 10 or 15 pounds.,You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight,up and down within that range,,but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.,The hypothalamus, the part of the brain,that regulates body weight,,there are more than a dozen chemical signals,in the brain that tell your body to gain weight,,more than another dozen thatntell your body to lose it,,and the system works like a thermostat,,responding to signals from the body,by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,,to keep your weight stable as conditions change.,That's what a thermostat does, right?,It keeps the temperature in your house the same,as the weather changes outside.,Now you can try to change the temperature,in your house by opening a window in the winter,,but that's not going to changenthe setting on the thermostat,,which will respond by kicking on the furnace,to warm the place back up.,Your brain works exactly the same way,,responding to weight loss by using powerful tools,to push your body back,to what it considers normal.,If you lose a lot of weight,,your brain reacts as if you were starving,,and whether you started out fat or thin,,your brain's response is exactly the same.,We would love to think that your brain could tell,whether you need to lose weight or not,,but it can't.,If you do lose a lot of weight,,you become hungry,,and your muscles burn less energy.,Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University,has found that people who have lost,10 percent of their body weight,burn 250 to 400 calories less,because their metabolism is suppressed.,That's a lot of food.,This means that a successful dieter,must eat this much less forever,than someone of the same weight,who has always been thin. 
 From an evolutionary perspective,,your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.,When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival,depended on conserving energy,,and regaining the weight when food was available,would have protected themnagainst the next shortage.,Over the course of human history,,starvation has been a much bigger problem,than overeating.,This may explain a very sad fact:,Set points can go up,,but they rarely go down.,Now, if your mother ever mentioned,that life is not fair,,this is the kind of thing she was talking about.,(Laughter),Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.,Even after you've kept the weight off,for as long as seven years,,your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.,If that weight loss had been due to a long famine,,that would be a sensible response.,In our modern world of drive-thru burgers,,it's not working out so well for many of us.,That difference between our ancestral past,and our abundant present,is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff,of the University of Ottawa,would like to take some of his patients back to a time,when food was less available,,and it's also the reason,that changing the food environment,is really going to be the most effective solution,to obesity. 
 Sadly, a temporary weight gain,can become permanent.,If you stay at a high weight for too long,,probably a matter of years for most of us,,your brain may decide that that's the new normal. 
 Psychologists classify eaters into two groups,,those who rely on their hunger,and those who try to control their eating,through willpower, like most dieters.,Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.,The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters,are less likely to be overweight,,and they spend less time thinking about food.,Controlled eaters are more vulnerable,to overeating in response to advertising,,super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.,And a small indulgence,,like eating one scoop of ice cream,,is more likely to lead to a food binge,in controlled eaters.,Children are especially vulnerable,to this cycle of dieting and then binging.,Several long-term studies have shown,that girls who diet in their early teenage years,are three times more likely to become overweight,five years later,,even if they started at a normal weight,,and all of these studies found,that the same factors,that predicted weight gain,also predicted the development of eating disorders.,The other factor, by the way,,those of you who are parents,,was being teased by family members,about their weight.,So don't do that.,(Laughter) 
 I left almost all my graphs at home,,but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,,because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.,(Laughter),This is a study that looked at the risk of death,over a 14-year period,based on four healthy habits:,eating enough fruits and vegetables,,exercise three times a week,,not smoking,,and drinking in moderation.,Let's start by looking at the normal weight,people in the study.,The height of the bars is the risk of death,,and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers,on the horizontal axis,are the number of those healthy habits,that a given person had.,And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,,the less likely people were to die during the study.,Now let's look at what happens,in overweight people.,The ones that had no healthy habits,had a higher risk of death.,Adding just one healthy habit,pulls overweight people back into the normal range.,For obese people with no healthy habits,,the risk is very high, seven times higher,than the healthiest groups in the study.,But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.,In fact, if you look only at the group,with all four healthy habits,,you can see that weight makes very little difference.,You can take control of your health,by taking control of your lifestyle,,even If you can't lose weight,and keep it off. 
 Diets don't have very much reliability.,Five years after a diet,,most people have regained the weight.,Forty percent of them have gained even more.,If you think about this,,the typical outcome of dieting,is that you're more likely to gain weight,in the long run than to lose it. 
 If I've convinced you that dieting,might be a problem,,the next question is, what do you do about it?,And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.,I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate,or take up yoga.,I'm talking about mindful eating:,learning to understand your body's signals,so that you eat when you're hungry,and stop when you're full,,because a lot of weight gain boils down,to eating when you're not hungry.,How do you do it?,Give yourself permission to eat,as much as you want, and then work on figuring out,what makes your body feel good.,Sit down to regular meals without distractions.,Think about how your body feels,when you start to eat and when you stop,,and let your hunger decide,when you should be done.,It took about a year for me to learn this,,but it's really been worth it.,I am so much more relaxed around food,than I have ever been in my life.,I often don't think about it.,I forget we have chocolate in the house.,It's like aliens have taken over my brain.,It's just completely different.,I should say that,this approach to eating probablynwon't make you lose weight,unless you often eat when you're not hungry,,but doctors don't know of any approach,that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,,and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on,preventing weight gain,instead of promoting weight loss.,Let's face it:,If diets worked, we'd all be thin already.,(Laughter),Why do we keep doing the same thing,and expecting different results?,Diets may seem harmless,,but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.,At worst, they ruin lives:,Weight obsession leads to eating disorders,,especially in young kids.,In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls,say they've been on a diet.,Our daughters have learned to measure their worth,by the wrong scale.,Even at its best,,dieting is a waste of time and energy.,It takes willpower which you could be using,to help your kids with their homework,or to finish that important work project,,and because willpower is limited,,any strategy that relies on its consistent application,is pretty much guaranteed,to eventually fail you,when your attention moves on to something else. 
 Let me leave you with one last thought.,What if we told all those dieting girls,that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?,What if we taught them to work with their appetite,instead of fearing it?,I think most of them would be happier and healthier,,and as adults,,many of them would probably be thinner.,I wish someone had told me that,back when I was 13. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)My work focuses on the connection of,both thinking about our community life,being part of the environment,where architecture grows from the natural,local conditions and traditions. 
 Today I brought two recent projects,as an example of this.,Both projects are in emerging countries,,one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.,And also they have in common,that the different analyses from different perspectives,becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture. 
 The first example started with an invitation,to design a multistory shopping mall,in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.,And this is the type of building,we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,,of what we had to design.,At first, the first thing I thought was,,I want to run away. 
 (Laughter) 
 After seeing a few of these buildings --,there are many in the city --,we realized that they have three very big points.,First, these buildings, they are almost empty,because they have very large shops,where people cannot afford to buy things.,Second, they need tons of energy to perform,because of the skin treatment with glass,that creates heat in the inside,,and then you need a lot of cooling.,In a city where this shouldn't happen,because they have really mild weather,that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.,And third is that their image has nothing to do,with Africa and with Ethiopia.,It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions. 
 Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,,I was really captivated by the old merkato,that is this open-air structure,where thousands of people, they go and buy things,every day from small vendors.,And also it has this idea of the public space,that uses the outdoors to create activity.,So I thought, this is what I really want to design,,not a shopping mall.,But the question was how we could do a multistory,,contemporary building with these principles. 
 The next challenge was when we looked at the site,,that is, in a really growing area of the city,,where most of these buildings that you see in the image,,they were not there.,And it's also between two parallel streets,that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters. 
 So the first thing we did was to create a connection,between these two streets,,putting all the entrances of the building.,And this extends with an inclined atrium,that creates an open-air space in the building,that self-protects itself with its own shape,from the sun and the rain.,And around this void,we placed this idea of the market with small shops,,that change in each floor because of the shape of the void. 
 I also thought, how to close the building?,And I really wanted to find a solution,that would respond to the local climate conditions.,And I started thinking about the textile,like a shell made of concrete,with perforations that would let the air in,,and also the light, but in a filtered way.,And then the inspiration came from these beautiful npatterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.,That they have fractal geometry properties,and this helped me to shape the whole facade.,And we are building that,with these small prefabricated pieces,that are the windows that let the air and the light,in a controlled way inside the building.,And this is complemented by these small colored glasses,that use the light from the inside of the building,to light up the building at night. 
 With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers,because they were like,,"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.",But then we all realized that this idea of the market,happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall,because basically they had more shops to sell.,And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,,not only because of the material compared with the glass,,but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.,So we created some budget savings,that we used to implement the project. 
 And the first implementation was to think,about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy,in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.,So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.,And then under those panels,we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars,that would create this urban oasis.,And these porches on the roof,,all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.,Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction. 
 The second example is a master plan,of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.,And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,,I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,,but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture. 
 During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina,that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,,opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.,When I went to the site, the first design operation we did,was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks,similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona,and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.,On top of that, we selected some strategic points,reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,,and this modified this initial pattern. 
 And the last operation was to think about the cell,,the small cell of the project, like the apartment,,as an essential part of the master plan.,And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation,in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?,And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house,and then a natural ventilation.,So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments,are perfectly oriented in that direction. 
 And this is the result,that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.,It has these blocks with courtyards,,and then on the ground floor,you have all these connections for the pedestrians.,And also it responds to the local regulations that establish,a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.,And it also reinforces this idea of the gates. 
 The volume has this connecting shape,that shades itself with three different types of apartments,and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood,And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,,such as a gym and a kindergarten,and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.,The roof, which is my favorite space of the project,is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.,And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,,and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,,jumping from one building to another. 
 These two examples,,they have a common approach in the design process.,And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see,the cities literally growing.,In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow,changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.,For this reason, I see even more importance,to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions,that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment,and that aim to connect nature and people. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Do you think it's possiblento control someone's attention?,Even more than that,nwhat about predicting human behavior?,I think those are interesting ideas.,For me, that would benthe perfect superpower,,actually kind of an evil waynof approaching it.,But for myself, in the past,nI've spent the last 20 years,studying human behaviornfrom a rather unorthodox way:,picking pockets.,When we think of misdirection,,we think of somethingnas looking off to the side,,when actually the thingsnright in front of us,are often the hardest to see,,the things that you look at every daynthat you're blinded to. 
 For example, how many of you still havenyour cell phones on you right now?,Great. Double-check.,Make sure you still have them.,I was doing some shopping before. 
 (Laughter) 
 You've looked at them a few times today,,but I'll ask you a question.,Without looking at it directly yet,,can you remember the iconnin the bottom right corner?,Bring them out, check and seenhow accurate you were.,How'd you do?,Show of hands. Did we get it? 
 Now that you're done, close them down.,Every phone has something in common.,No matter how you organize the icons,,you still have a clock on the front.,So, without looking at your phone,nwhat time was it?,You just looked at your clock, right?,Interesting idea.,Let's take that a step furthernwith a game of trust.,Close your eyes.,I realize I'm asking you to donthat while you just heard,there's a pickpocket in the room,nbut close your eyes. 
 Now, you've been watching menfor about 30 seconds.,With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?,Make your best guess.,What color is my shirt?nWhat color is my tie?,Now open your eyes.,Show of hands, were you right?,Interesting, isn't it? 
 Some of us are a little bitnmore perceptive than others, it seems.,But I have a different theorynabout that model of attention.,They have fancy models of attention,nPosner's trinity model of attention.,For me, I like to think of it verynsimple, like a surveillance system.,It's kind of like you havenall these fancy sensors,,and inside your brainnis a little security guard.,For me, I like to call him Frank.,So Frank is sitting at a desk.,He's got lots of coolninformation in front of him,,high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,,he's got a little phonenthat he can pick up, listen to the ears,,all these senses, all these perceptions.,But attention is what steersnyour perceptions,,it's what controls your reality.,It's the gateway to the mind.,If you don't attend to something,nyou can't be aware of it.,But ironically, you can attendnto something without being aware of it.,For example, the cocktail effect:,You're in a party, havingnconversations with someone,,and yet you can recognize your name,without realizingnyou were listening to that. 
 Now, for my job, I have to playnwith techniques to exploit this,,to play with your attentionnas a limited resource.,So if I could controlnhow you spend your attention,,if I could maybe steal your attentionnthrough a distraction.,Now, instead of doing it like misdirection,and throwing it off to the side,,instead, what I choosento focus on is Frank,,to be able to play with the Frankninside your head,,your security guard,,and get you, instead of focusingnon your external senses,,just to go internal for a second. 
 So if I ask you to accessna memory, like, what is that?,What just happened? Do you have a wallet?,Do you have an American Expressnin your wallet?,And when I do that,nyour Frank turns around.,He accesses the file.nHe has to rewind the tape.,What's interesting is,nhe can't rewind the tape,at the same time that he's tryingnto process new data. 
 This sounds like a good theory,,but I could talk for a long time,ntell you lots of things,,and a portion of them may be true,,but I think it's better if I triednto show that to you here live.,If I come down, I'm goingnto do a bit of shopping.,Just hold still where you are. 
 Hello, how are you?nIt's lovely to see you.,Wonderful job onstage.,Lovely watch, it doesn'tncome off very well.,Do you have a ring as well?,Good. Just taking inventory.nYou're like a buffet.,Hard to tell where to start,nso many great things. 
 Hi, how are you? Good to see you. 
 Hi, sir, could you stand up, please?nJust right where you are.,You're married,nyou follow directions well.,Nice to meet you, sir.,You don't have a lot in your pockets.nAnything down here?,Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go.nYou're doing well. 
 Hi, sir, how are you?,Good to see you, sir.nYou have a ring, a watch.,Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't. 
 AR: Well, we'll find one for you.nCome on up this way, Joe.,Give Joe a round of applause.nCome on up, Joe. Let's play a game. 
 (Applause) 
 AR: Pardon me.,I don't think I need this clicker anymore.,Thank you very much. I appreciate that.,Come on up to the stage, Joe.nLet's play a little game now.,Anything in your front pockets? 
 J: Money. 
 AR: Money! All right, let's try that.,Can you stand right over this way for me?,Turn around and, let's see,,if I give you somethingnthat belongs to me,,this is just something I have,,a poker chip.,Hold out your hand for me.,Watch it closely.,This is a task for you to focus on.,You have your money in your front pocket? 
 J: Yup.nAR: Good. 
 I won't put my hand in your pocket.nI'm not ready for that kind of commitment.,Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,,and that was rather traumatizing for me.,I wanted his wallet,nhe gave me his number.,Big miscommunication. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's do this simply.nSqueeze your hand tight.,Do you feel the poker chip in your hand? 
 J: I do. 
 AR: Would you be surprisednif I took it? Say yes. 
 J: Very.nAR: Good. 
 Open your hand. Thank you very much.,I'll cheat if you give me a chance.,Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.,Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.,Did you see it go? Joe: No. 
 AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.,While we're focused on the hand,nit's sitting on your shoulder.,Go ahead and take it off.,Now, let's try that again.,Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.,Put your hand up a little bit higher,nbut watch it close.,If I did it slowly,nit'd be on your shoulder. 
 (Laughter) 
 Joe, we're going to keep doingnthis till you catch it.,You'll get it eventually.nI have faith in you.,Squeeze firm.nYou're human, you're not slow.,It's back on your shoulder.,You were focused on your hand, distracted.,While you were watching,nI couldn't get your watch off.,Yet you had something inside your pocket.,Do you remember what it was? 
 J: Money. 
 AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there? 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, there it was. Put it away.,We're just shopping.,This trick's more about the timing.,I'm going to try to push itninside your hand.,Put your other hand on top, would you?,It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?,Looks a lot like the watchnI was wearing, doesn't it? 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 J: That's pretty good.nAR: Oh, thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 But it's only a start.nLet's try it a little bit differently.,Hold your hands together.nYour other hand on top.,If you're watching this little token,,this obviously has becomena little target, like a red herring.,If we watch this kind of close,nit looks like it goes away.,It's not back on your shoulder.,It falls out of the air,nlands right back in the hand.,Did you see it go?,Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy.nHe's union, works up there all day.,If I do it slowly it goes straight away,nit lands by your pocket.,Is it in this pocket, sir?,Don't reach in your pocket.nThat's a different show. 
 (Squeaking) 
 That's rather strange.nThey have shots for that.,Can I show them? Rather bizarre.nIs this yours, sir?,I have no idea how that works.nWe'll send that over there. 
 I need help with this one.,Step over this way for me.,Don't run away. You had somethingndown by your pants pocket.,I was checking mine.nI couldn't find everything,,but I noticed you had something here.,Can I feel the outside for a moment?,Down here I noticed this.nIs this something of yours, sir?,I have no idea. That's a shrimp. 
 J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later. 
 AR: You've entertainednall of these people in a wonderful way,,better than you know.,So we'd love to give you thisnlovely watch as a gift. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hopefully it matches his taste.,We have a couple of other things,,a little bit of cash.,And we have a few other things,,these all belong to you,,along with a big round of applausenfrom all your friends. 
 (Applause) 
 Joe, thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 So, same question I asked you before,,but this time you don't havento close your eyes.,What am I wearing? 
 Audience: Oh! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Hesitant applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Attention is a powerful thing.,Like I said, it shapes your reality.,So, I guess I'd like to posenthat question to you.,If you could control somebody's attention,,what would you do with it? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So why do we learn mathematics?,Essentially, for three reasons:,calculation,,application,,and last, and unfortunately least,in terms of the time we give it,,inspiration. 
 Mathematics is the science of patterns,,and we study it to learn how to think logically,,critically and creatively,,but too much of the mathematicsnthat we learn in school,is not effectively motivated,,and when our students ask,,"Why are we learning this?",then they often hear that they'll need it,in an upcoming math class or on a future test.,But wouldn't it be great,if every once in a while we did mathematics,simply because it was fun or beautiful,or because it excited the mind?,Now, I know many people have not,had the opportunity to see how this can happen,,so let me give you a quick example,with my favorite collection of numbers,,the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause) 
 Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.,That's great. 
 Now these numbers can be appreciated,in many different ways.,From the standpoint of calculation,,they're as easy to understand,as one plus one, which is two.,Then one plus two is three,,two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,,and so on.,Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci,was actually named Leonardo of Pisa,,and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci,",which taught the Western world,the methods of arithmetic that we use today.,In terms of applications,,Fibonacci numbers appear in nature,surprisingly often.,The number of petals on a flower,is typically a Fibonacci number,,or the number of spirals on a sunflower,or a pineapple,tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. 
 In fact, there are many morenapplications of Fibonacci numbers,,but what I find most inspirational about them,are the beautiful number patterns they display.,Let me show you one of my favorites.,Suppose you like to square numbers,,and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter) 
 Let's look at the squares,of the first few Fibonacci numbers.,So one squared is one,,two squared is four, three squared is nine,,five squared is 25, and so on.,Now, it's no surprise,that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,,you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?,That's how they're created.,But you wouldn't expect anything special,to happen when you add the squares together.,But check this out.,One plus one gives us two,,and one plus four gives us five.,And four plus nine is 13,,nine plus 25 is 34,,and yes, the pattern continues. 
 In fact, here's another one.,Suppose you wanted to look at,adding the squares ofnthe first few Fibonacci numbers.,Let's see what we get there.,So one plus one plus four is six.,Add nine to that, we get 15.,Add 25, we get 40.,Add 64, we get 104.,Now look at those numbers.,Those are not Fibonacci numbers,,but if you look at them closely,,you'll see the Fibonacci numbers,buried inside of them. 
 Do you see it? I'll show it to you.,Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,,40 is five times eight,,two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate? 
 (Laughter) 
 Fibonacci! Of course. 
 Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,,it's even more satisfying to understand,why they are true.,Let's look at that last equation.,Why should the squares of one, one,ntwo, three, five and eight,add up to eight times 13?,I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.,We'll start with a one-by-one square,and next to that put another one-by-one square.,Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.,Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,,and next to that, a three-by-three square,,beneath that, a five-by-five square,,and then an eight-by-eight square,,creating one giant rectangle, right? 
 Now let me ask you a simple question:,what is the area of the rectangle?,Well, on the one hand,,it's the sum of the areas,of the squares inside it, right?,Just as we created it.,It's one squared plus one squared,plus two squared plus three squared,plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?,That's the area.,On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,,the area is equal to its height times its base,,and the height is clearly eight,,and the base is five plus eight,,which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?,So the area is also eight times 13.,Since we've correctly calculated the area,two different ways,,they have to be the same number,,and that's why the squares of one,none, two, three, five and eight,add up to eight times 13. 
 Now, if we continue this process,,we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,,21 by 34, and so on. 
 Now check this out.,If you divide 13 by eight,,you get 1.625.,And if you divide the larger numbernby the smaller number,,then these ratios get closer and closer,to about 1.618,,known to many people as the Golden Ratio,,a number which has fascinated mathematicians,,scientists and artists for centuries. 
 Now, I show all this to you because,,like so much of mathematics,,there's a beautiful side to it,that I fear does not get enough attention,in our schools.,We spend lots of time learning about calculation,,but let's not forget about application,,including, perhaps, the mostnimportant application of all,,learning how to think. 
 If I could summarize this in one sentence,,it would be this:,Mathematics is not just solving for x,,it's also figuring out why. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)(Nature sounds),When I first begannrecording wild soundscapes,45 years ago,,I had no idea that ants,,insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses,created a sound signature.,But they do.,And so does every wildnhabitat on the planet,,like the Amazon rainforestnyou're hearing behind me.,In fact, temperatenand tropical rainforests,each produce a vibrant animal orchestra,,that instantaneousnand organized expression,of insects, reptiles,namphibians, birds and mammals.,And every soundscapenthat springs from a wild habitat,generates its own unique signature,,one that contains incrediblenamounts of information,,and it's some of that informationnI want to share with you today.,The soundscape is madenup of three basic sources.,The first is the geophony,,or the nonbiological sounds that occur,in any given habitat,,like wind in the trees, water in a stream,,waves at the ocean shore,nmovement of the Earth.,The second of these is the biophony.,The biophony is all of the sound,that's generated by organismsnin a given habitat,at one time and in one place.,And the third is all of the soundnthat we humans generate,that's called anthrophony.,Some of it is controlled,nlike music or theater,,but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,,which some of us refer to as noise.,There was a time whennI considered wild soundscapes,to be a worthless artifact.,They were just there,nbut they had no significance.,Well, I was wrong. WhatnI learned from these encounters,was that careful listening givesnus incredibly valuable tools,by which to evaluatenthe health of a habitat,across the entire spectrum of life.,When I began recording in the late '60s,,the typical methodsnof recording were limited,to the fragmented capturenof individual species,like birds mostly, in the beginning,,but later animalsnlike mammals and amphibians.,To me, this was a little like tryingnto understand,the magnificencenof Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,by abstracting the soundnof a single violin player,out of the context of the orchestra,and hearing just that one part.,Fortunately, more and more institutions,are implementing the more holistic models,that I and a few of my colleaguesnhave introduced,to the field of soundscape ecology.,When I began recordingnover four decades ago,,I could record for 10 hours,and capture one hour of usable material,,good enough for an albumnor a film soundtrack,or a museum installation.,Now, because of global warming,,resource extraction,,and human noise, among many other factors,,it can take up to 1,000 hours or more,to capture the same thing.,Fully 50 percent of my archive,comes from habitats so radically altered,that they're either altogether silent,or can no longer be heardnin any of their original form.,The usual methods of evaluating a habitat,have been done by visuallyncounting the numbers of species,and the numbers of individualsnwithin each species in a given area.,However, by comparingndata that ties together,both density and diversitynfrom what we hear,,I'm able to arrive at muchnmore precise fitness outcomes.,And I want to show you some examples,that typify the possibilities unlocked,by diving into this universe.,This is Lincoln Meadow.,LincolnnMeadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive,east of San Francisconin the Sierra Nevada Mountains,,at about 2,000 meters altitude,,and I've been recordingnthere for many years.,In 1988, a logging companynconvinced local residents,that there would be absolutelynno environmental impact,from a new method they were trying,called "selective logging,",taking out a tree here and there,rather than clear-cutting a whole area.,With permission granted to record,both before and after the operation,,I set up my gear and capturedna large number of dawn choruses,to very strict protocolnand calibrated recordings,,because I wanted a really good baseline.,This is an example of a spectrogram.,A spectrogram is a graphicnillustration of sound,with time from leftnto right across the page --,15 seconds in this case is represented —,and frequency from the bottomnof the page to the top,,lowest to highest.,And you can seenthat the signature of a stream,is represented here in the bottomnthird or half of the page,,while birds that were once in that meadow,are represented in the signaturenacross the top.,There were a lot of them.,And here's Lincoln Meadownbefore selective logging.,(Nature sounds),Well, a year later I returned,,and using the same protocols,and recording under the same conditions,,I recorded a number of examples,of the same dawn choruses,,and now this is what we've got.,This is after selective logging.,You can see that the streamnis still represented,in the bottom third of the page,,but notice what's missingnin the top two thirds.,(Nature sounds),Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.,Well, I've returnednto Lincoln Meadow 15 times,in the last 25 years,,and I can tell you that the biophony,,the density and diversitynof that biophony,,has not yet returnednto anything like it was,before the operation.,But here's a picturenof Lincoln Meadow taken after,,and you can seenthat from the perspective of the camera,or the human eye,,hardly a stick or a treenappears to be out of place,,which would confirm the loggingncompany's contention,that there's nothingnof environmental impact.,However, our ears tell usna very different story.,Young students are always asking me,what these animals are saying,,and really I've got no idea.,But I can tell you that they donexpress themselves.,Whether or not we understandnit is a different story.,I was walking along the shore in Alaska,,and I came across this tide pool,filled with a colony of sea anemones,,these wonderful eating machines,,relatives of coral and jellyfish.,And curious to seenif any of them made any noise,,I dropped a hydrophone,,an underwater microphonencovered in rubber,,down the mouth part,,and immediately the critter began,to absorb the microphone into its belly,,and the tentacles werensearching out of the surface,for something of nutritional value.,The static-like sounds that are very low,,that you're going to hear right now.,(Static sounds),Yeah, but watch. When itndidn't find anything to eat --,(Honking sound),(Laughter),I think that's an expressionnthat can be understood,in any language.,(Laughter),At the end of its breeding cycle,,the Great Basin Spadefoot toad,digs itself down about a meter under,the hard-panned desertnsoil of the American West,,where it can stay for many seasons,until conditions are justnright for it to emerge again.,And when there's enough moisturenin the soil,in the spring, frogs will dignthemselves to the surface,and gather around thesenlarge, vernal pools,in great numbers.,And they vocalize in a chorus,that's absolutely in syncnwith one another.,And they do that for two reasons.,The first is competitive,nbecause they're looking for mates,,and the second is cooperative,,because if they'renall vocalizing in sync together,,it makes it really difficultnfor predators like coyotes,,foxes and owls to singlenout any individual for a meal.,This is a spectrogramnof what the frog chorusing looks like,when it's in a very healthy pattern.,(Frogs croaking),Mono Lake is just to the eastnof Yosemite National Park,in California,,and it's a favoritenhabitat of these toads,,and it's also favored by U.S.nNavy jet pilots,,who train in their fightersnflying them at speeds,exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour,and altitudes only a couple hundred meters,above ground level of the Mono Basin,,very fast, very low, and so loud,that the anthrophony, the human noise,,even though it's six and a half kilometers,from the frog pond younjust heard a second ago,,it masked the soundnof the chorusing toads.,You can see in this spectrogramnthat all of the energy,that was once in the firstnspectrogram is gone,from the top end of the spectrogram,,and that there's breaksnin the chorusing at two and a half,,four and a half,nand six and a half seconds,,and then the soundnof the jet, the signature,,is in yellow at the verynbottom of the page.,(Frogs croaking),Now at the end of that flyby,,it took the frogs fully 45 minutes,to regain their chorusing synchronicity,,during which time, and under a full moon,,we watched as two coyotesnand a great horned owl,came in to picknoff a few of their numbers.,The good news is that, with a little bitnof habitat restoration,and fewer flights, the frog populations,,once diminishingnduring the 1980s and early '90s,,have pretty much returned to normal.,I want to end with a storyntold by a beaver.,It's a very sad story,,but it really illustrates how animals,can sometimes show emotion,,a very controversial subjectnamong some older biologists.,A colleague of mine was recordingnin the American Midwest,around this pond that had been formed,maybe 16,000 years ago at the endnof the last ice age.,It was also formed in part by a beaver dam,at one end that heldnthat whole ecosystem together,in a very delicate balance.,And one afternoon, while he was recording,,there suddenly appearednfrom out of nowhere,a couple of game wardens,,who for no apparent reason,,walked over to the beaver dam,,dropped a stick of dynamitendown it, blowing it up,,killing the female and her young babies.,Horrified, my colleagues remained behind,to gather his thoughts,and to record whatever he couldnthe rest of the afternoon,,and that evening, he capturedna remarkable event:,the lone surviving male beavernswimming in slow circles,crying out inconsolably for itsnlost mate and offspring.,This is probably the saddest sound,I've ever heard coming from any organism,,human or other.,(Beaver crying),Yeah. Well.,There are many facets to soundscapes,,among them the ways in which animalsntaught us to dance and sing,,which I'll save for another time.,But you have heard how biophonies,help clarify our understandingnof the natural world.,You've heard the impactnof resource extraction,,human noise and habitat destruction.,And where environmentalnsciences have typically,tried to understandnthe world from what we see,,a much fuller understandingncan be got from what we hear.,Biophonies and geophoniesnare the signature voices,of the natural world,,and as we hear them,,we're endowed with a sense of place,,the true story of the world we live in.,In a matter of seconds,,a soundscape reveals much more information,from many perspectives,,from quantifiable datanto cultural inspiration.,Visual capture implicitly frames,a limited frontal perspectivenof a given spatial context,,while soundscapes widen that scope,to a full 360 degrees,ncompletely enveloping us.,And while a picture maynbe worth 1,000 words,,a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.,And our ears tell us,that the whispernof every leaf and creature,speaks to the naturalnsources of our lives,,which indeed may hold the secretsnof love for all things,,especially our own humanity,,and the last word goesnto a jaguar from the Amazon.,(Growling),Thank you for listening.,(Applause)Anyone in the room thought about sex today?,(Laughter),Yeah, you did.,Thank you for putting your hand up over there.,Well, I'm here to provide you with,some biological validation,for your sordid daydreams.,I'm here to tell you a few things,that you might not have known about wild sex. 
 Now, when humans think about sex,,male and female forms,are generally what come to mind,,but for many millions of years,,such specific categories didn't even exist.,Sex was a mere fusion of bodies,or a trickle of DNA,shared between two or more beings.,It wasn't until about 500 million years ago,that we start to see structures akin to a penis,or a thing that gives DNA out,,and a vagina, something that receives it.,Now invariably, you're probably thinking about,what belongs to our own species,,these very familiar structures,,but the diversity that we see in sexual structures,in the animal kingdom that has evolved,in response to the multitude of factors,surrounding reproduction,is pretty mind-blowing. 
 Penile diversity is especially profuse.,So this is a paper nautilus.,It's a close relative of squid and octopus,,and males have a hectocotylus.,Just what is a hectocotylus?,A detachable, swimming penis.,It leaves the [body of the male],,finds the female throughnpheromonal cues in the water,,attaches itself to her body,and deposits the sperm.,For many decades, biologists actually felt,that the hectocotylus was anseparate organism altogether.,Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.,And the tapir has a prehensile penis.,It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis,much akin to what we have with our hands.,And it uses this dexterity,to bypass the vagina altogether,and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,,not to mention it's a pretty good size.,The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,,however, is not that of the tapir.,The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio,in the animal kingdom actually belongs,to the meager beach barnacle,,and this video is actually showing you,what the human penis would look like,if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.,(Laughter),Mm-hm. (Laughter) 
 So with all of this diversity in structure,,one might think, then, that penises,are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place,for the purposes of successful reproduction.,Simply insert part A into slot B,,and we should all be good to go.,But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,,and that's because we can'tnjust take form into account.,We have to think about function as well,,and when it comes to sex,,function relates to the contributions made,by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.,And these contributions are far from equal.,Eggs are very expensive to make,,so it makes sense for females to be very choosy,about who she shares them with.,Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,,so it makes more sense for males,to have a more-sex-is-better strategy,when it comes to siring members,of future generations. 
 So how do animals cope,with these very incongruentnneeds between the sexes?,I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,,or if she has the ability to store sperm,and she simply has enough,,then it makes more sense for her to spend her time,doing other biologically relevant things:,avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,,gathering and ingesting food.,This is, of course, bad news for any male,who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,,and this sets the scene fornsome pretty drastic strategies,for successful fertilization.,This is bedbug sex,,and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.,Males have a spiked, barbed penis,that they literally stab into the female,,and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.,They stab it anywhere in her body,,and the sperm simply migrates,through her hemolymph to her ovaries.,If a female gets too many stab wounds,,or if a stab wound happens to become infected,,she can actually die from it. 
 Now if you've ever been out for a nice,,peaceful walk by the lake,and happened to see some ducks having sex,,you've undoubtedly been alarmed,,because it looks like gang rape.,And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.,A group of males will grab a female,,hold her down,,and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis,into her corkscrew-shaped vagina,over and over and over again.,From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.,Now the female actuallyngets the last laugh, though,,because she can actually manipulate her posture,so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors,better access to her ovaries. 
 Now, I like to share storiesnlike this with my audiences,because, yeah, we humans,,we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,,there's romance, and there's orgasm.,But orgasm didn't actually evolve,until about 65 million years ago,with the advent of mammals.,But some animals had it goingnon quite a bit before that.,There are some more primitive ways,of pleasing one's partner. 
 Earwig males have either,really large penile appendages,or really small ones.,It's a very simple genetically inherited trait,and the males are not otherwise any different.,Those that have long penile appendages,are not bigger or stronger,or otherwise any different at all.,So going back to our biological minds, then,,we might think that females should choose,to have sex with the guys thatnhave the shorter appendages,,because she can use her time for other things:,avoiding predators, taking care of young,,finding and ingesting food.,But biologists have repeatedly observed,that females choose to have sex,with the males that have the long appendages.,Why do they do this?,Well, according to the biological literature,,"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males,may elicit more favorable female responses,through superior mechanicalnor stimulatory interaction,with the female reproductive tract.",Mm-hm. 
 These are Mexican guppies,,and what you see on their upper maxilla,is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,,and these filaments basically form,a fish mustache, if you will.,Now males have been observed to prod,the female's genital opening,prior to copulating with her,,and in what I have lovingly termednthe Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,,females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found,with males that have these fish mustaches.,A little guppy porn for you right there. 
 So we've seen very different strategies,that males are using when it comes to,winning a female partner.,We've seen a coercion strategy in whichnsexual structures are used in a forceful way,to basically make a female have sex.,We've also seen a titillation strategy,where males are actually,pleasing their female partners into choosing them,as a sex partner.,Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,,it's the coercion strategy that we see,time and time again.,It's very common in many phyla,,from invertebrates to avian species,,mammals, and, of course, even in primates. 
 Now interestingly, there nare a few mammalian species,in which females have evolved specialized genitalia,that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.,Female elephants and female hyenas,have a penile clitoris,,or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,,much like a penis,,and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals,by merely looking at their external morphology.,So before a male can insertnhis penis into a female's vagina,,she has to take this penile clitoris,and basically inside-out it in her own body.,I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.,It's simply not going to happen,unless the female is on board with the action.,Now, even more interesting is the fact,that elephant and hyena societies,are entirely matriarchal:,they're run by females, groups of females,,sisters, aunts and offspring,,and when young males attain sexual maturity,,they're turfed out of the group.,In hyena societies, adult males,are actually the lowest on the social scale.,They can take part in a kill only after,everybody else, including the offspring.,So it seems that when you take the penis power,away from a male,,you take away all the social power he has. 
 So what are my take-homenmessages from my talk today?,Well, sex is just so much more,than insert part A into slot B,and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.,The sexual strategies and reproductive structures,that we see in the animal kingdom basically,dictate how males and femalesnwill react to each other,,which then dictates how populations and societies,form and evolve. 
 So it may not be surprising to any of you,that animals, including ourselves,,spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,,but what might surprise you is the extent to which,so many other aspects of their lives and our lives,are influenced by it. 
 So thank you, and happy daydreaming. 
 (Applause)Good morning.,My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.,But no, I wasn't born there.,This was where I was born:,Shanghai, at the heightnof the Cultural Revolution.,My grandmother tells me that she heard,the sound of gunfirenalong with my first cries.,When I was growing up, I was told a story,that explained all I evernneeded to know about humanity.,It went like this.,All human societies developnin linear progression,,beginning with primitivensociety, then slave society,,feudalism, capitalism, socialism,,and finally, guess where we end up?,Communism!,Sooner or later, all of humanity,,regardless of culture,nlanguage, nationality,,will arrive at this final stage,of political and social development.,The entire world's peoples will be unified,in this paradise on Earth,and live happily ever after.,But before we get there, we're engaged,in a struggle between good and evil,,the good of socialismnagainst the evil of capitalism,,and the good shall triumph.,That, of course, was the meta-narrative,distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.,And the Chinese bought it.,We were taught that grandnstory day in and day out.,It became part of us,nand we believed in it.,The story was a bestseller.,About one third of the entirenworld's population,lived under that meta-narrative.,Then, the world changed overnight.,As for me, disillusionednby the failed religion of my youth,,I went to America and becamena Berkeley hippie.,(Laughter),Now, as I was coming of age,nsomething else happened.,As if one big story wasn't enough,,I was told another one.,This one was just as grand.,It also claims that all human societies,develop in a linear progressionntowards a singular end.,This one went as follows:,All societies, regardless of culture,,be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,,must progress from traditional societies,in which groups are the basic units,to modern societiesnin which atomized individuals,are the sovereign units,,and all these individualsnare, by definition, rational,,and they all want one thing:,the vote.,Because they are all rational,nonce given the vote,,they produce good government,and live happily ever after.,Paradise on Earth, again.,Sooner or later, electoralndemocracy will be,the only political systemnfor all countries and all peoples,,with a free market to make them all rich.,But before we get there,nwe're engaged in a struggle,between good and evil.,(Laughter),The good belongs to thosenwho are democracies,and are charged with a missionnof spreading it,around the globe, sometimes by force,,against the evil of thosenwho do not hold elections.,(Video) George H.W. Bush:nA new world order...,(Video) George W. Bush:...nending tyranny in our world...,(Video) Barack Obama:...na single standard for all,who would hold power.,Eric X. Li: Now --,(Laughter) (Applause),This story also became a bestseller.,According to Freedom House,,the number of democraciesnwent from 45 in 1970,to 115 in 2010.,In the last 20 years,nWestern elites tirelessly,trotted around the globenselling this prospectus:,Multiple parties fight for political power,and everyone voting on them,is the only path to salvation,to the long-suffering developing world.,Those who buy the prospectusnare destined for success.,Those who do not are doomed to fail.,But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.,Fool me once...,(Laughter),The rest is history.,In just 30 years, China went from,one of the poorest agriculturalncountries in the world,to its second-largest economy.,Six hundred fifty million people,were lifted out of poverty.,Eighty percent of the entirenworld's poverty alleviation,during that period happened in China.,In other words, all the newnand old democracies,put together amounted to a mere fraction,of what a single, one-partynstate did without voting.,See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.,Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams,per person per month at one point.,Needless to say, I atenall my grandmother's portions.,So I asked myself, what's wrongnwith this picture?,Here I am in my hometown,,my business growing leaps and bounds.,Entrepreneurs are startingncompanies every day.,Middle class is expandingnin speed and scale,unprecedented in human history.,Yet, according to the grand story,,none of this should be happening.,So I went and did the only thing I could.nI studied it.,Yes, China is a one-party state,run by the Chinese CommunistnParty, the Party,,and they don't hold elections.,Three assumptions are made,by the dominant politicalntheories of our time.,Such a system is operationally rigid,,politically closed,nand morally illegitimate.,Well, the assumptions are wrong.,The opposites are true.,Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy,are the three defining characteristics,of China's one-party system.,Now, most politicalnscientists will tell us,that a one-party systemnis inherently incapable,of self-correction.,It won't last longnbecause it cannot adapt.,Now here are the facts.,In 64 years of running the largestncountry in the world,,the range of the Party's policiesnhas been wider,than any other country in recent memory,,from radical land collectivizationnto the Great Leap Forward,,then privatization of farmland,,then the Cultural Revolution,,then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,,then successor Jiang Zeminntook the giant political step,of opening up Party membershipnto private businesspeople,,something unimaginable during Mao's rule.,So the Party self-correctsnin rather dramatic fashions.,Institutionally, new rules get enacted,to correct previous dysfunctions.,For example, term limits.,Political leaders used to retainntheir positions for life,,and they used that to accumulate power,and perpetuate their rules.,Mao was the father of modern China,,yet his prolonged rule lednto disastrous mistakes.,So the Party instituted term limits,with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.,One thing we often hear is,,"Political reforms have laggednfar behind economic reforms,",and "China is in dire neednof political reform.",But this claim is a rhetorical trap,hidden behind a political bias.,See, some have decided a priori,what kinds of changes they want to see,,and only such changes cannbe called political reform.,The truth is, politicalnreforms have never stopped.,Compared with 30 years ago,n20 years, even 10 years ago,,every aspect of Chinese society,,how the country is governed,,from the most local levelnto the highest center,,are unrecognizable today.,Now such changes are simply not possible,without political reformsnof the most fundamental kind.,Now I would venture to suggest the Party,is the world's leadingnexpert in political reform.,The second assumptionnis that in a one-party state,,power gets concentratednin the hands of the few,,and bad governance and corruption follow.,Indeed, corruption is a big problem,,but let's first looknat the larger context.,Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.,The Party happens to benone of the most meritocratic,political institutions in the world today.,China's highest ruling body,nthe Politburo, has 25 members.,In the most recent one, only five of them,came from a background of privilege,nso-called princelings.,The other 20, including the presidentnand the premier,,came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.,In the larger centralncommittee of 300 or more,,the percentage of those who were born,into power and wealth was even smaller.,The vast majoritynof senior Chinese leaders,worked and competed their way to the top.,Compare that with the ruling elites,in both developednand developing countries,,I think you'll find the Partynbeing near the top,in upward mobility.,The question then is,nhow could that be possible,in a system run by one party?,Now we come to a powerfulnpolitical institution,,little-known to Westerners:,the Party's Organization Department.,The department functions like a giant,human resource enginenthat would be the envy,of even some of the most successfulncorporations.,It operates a rotating pyramid,made up of three components:,civil service, state-owned enterprises,,and social organizations like a university,or a community program.,They form separatenyet integrated career paths,for Chinese officials.,They recruit college gradsninto entry-level positions,in all three tracks,nand they start from the bottom,,called "keyuan" [clerk].,Then they could get promoted,through four increasingly elite ranks:,fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchun[deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].,Now these are not movesnfrom "Karate Kid," okay?,It's serious business.,The range of positions is wide,,from running health care in a village,to foreign investment in a city district,to manager in a company.,Once a year, the departmentnreviews their performance.,They interviewntheir superiors, their peers,,their subordinates. They vetntheir personal conduct.,They conduct public opinion surveys.,Then they promote the winners.,Throughout their careers, these cadres,can moventhrough and out of all three tracks.,Over time, the good ones movenbeyond the four base levels,to the fuju [deputy bureau chief]nand ju [bureau chief] levels.,There, they enter high officialdom.,By that point, a typicalnassignment will be,to manage a districtnwith a population in the millions,or a company with hundredsnof millions of dollars in revenue.,Just to show younhow competitive the system is,,in 2012, there were 900,000nfuke and ke levels,,600,000 fuchu and chu levels,,and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.,After the ju levels,,the best few move furthernup several more ranks,,and eventually make itnto the Central Committee.,The process takes two to three decades.,Does patronage play a role?nYes, of course.,But merit remains the fundamental driver.,In essence, the OrganizationnDepartment runs,a modernized versionnof China's centuries-old,mentoring system.,China's new president, Xi Jinping,,is the son of a former leader,nwhich is very unusual,,first of his kind to make the top job.,Even for him, the career took 30 years.,He started as a village manager,,and by the time he entered the Politburo,,he had managed areasnwith a total population,of 150 million people,and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S.ndollars.,Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?,This is not a put-down of anyone.nIt's just a statement of fact.,George W. Bush, remember him?,This is not a put-down.,(Laughter),Before becoming governor of Texas,,or Barack Obamanbefore running for president,,could not make even a small county manager,in China's system.,Winston Churchill once said that democracy,is a terrible systemnexcept for all the rest.,Well, apparently he hadn't heardnof the Organization Department.,Now, Westerners always assume that,multi-party electionnwith universal suffrage,is the only sourcenof political legitimacy.,I was asked once, "The Partynwasn't voted in by election.,Where is the source of legitimacy?",I said, "How about competency?",We all know the facts.,In 1949, when the Party took power,,China was mired in civil wars,ndismembered by foreign aggression,,average life expectancynat that time, 41 years old.,Today, it's the second largestneconomy in the world,,an industrial powerhouse,nand its people live,in increasing prosperity.,Pew Research polls Chinesenpublic attitudes,,and here are the numbers in recent years.,Satisfaction with the directionnof the country: 85 percent.,Those who think they're betternoff than five years ago:,70 percent.,Those who expect the future to be better:,a whopping 82 percent.,Financial Times pollsnglobal youth attitudes,,and these numbers, brand new,njust came from last week.,Ninety-three percentnof China's Generation Y,are optimisticnabout their country's future.,Now, if this is not legitimacy,nI'm not sure what is.,In contrast, most electoralndemocracies around the world,are suffering from dismal performance.,I don't need to elaboratenfor this audience,how dysfunctional it is,nfrom Washington to European capitals.,With a few exceptions, the vast number,of developing countries that havenadopted electoral regimes,are still sufferingnfrom poverty and civil strife.,Governments get elected,nand then they fall,below 50 percent approval in a few months,and stay there and get worsenuntil the next election.,Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle,of elect and regret.,At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,,not China's one-partynsystem, that is in danger,of losing legitimacy.,Now, I don't want to createnthe misimpression,that China's hunky-dory, on the way,to some kind of superpowerdom.,The country faces enormous challenges.,The social and economic problems that come,with wrenching changenlike this are mind-boggling.,Pollution is one. Food safety.nPopulation issues.,On the political front, the worstnproblem is corruption.,Corruption is widespreadnand undermines the system,and its moral legitimacy.,But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.,They say that corruption is the resultnof the one-party system,,and therefore, in order to cure it,,you have to do awaynwith the entire system.,But a more careful looknwould tell us otherwise.,Transparency International ranks China,between 70 and 80 in recentnyears among 170 countries,,and it's been moving up.,India, the largest democracy in the world,,94 and dropping.,For the hundred or so countriesnthat are ranked below China,,more than half of themnare electoral democracies.,So if election is the panaceanfor corruption,,how come these countries can't fix it?,Now, I'm a venture capitalist.nI make bets.,It wouldn't be fairnto end this talk without,putting myself on the linenand making some predictions.,So here they are.,In the next 10 years, Chinanwill surpass the U.S.,and become the largestneconomy in the world.,Income per capita will be near the top,of all developing countries.,Corruption will be curbed,nbut not eliminated,,and China will move up 10 to 20 notches,to above 60 in T.I. ranking.,Economic reform will accelerate,npolitical reform will continue,,and the one-party system will hold firm.,We live in the dusk of an era.,Meta-narratives that make universal claims,failed us in the 20th century,and are failing us in the 21st.,Meta-narrative is the cancer,that is killing democracy from the inside.,Now, I want to clarify something.,I'm not here to makenan indictment of democracy.,On the contrary, I thinkndemocracy contributed,to the rise of the Westnand the creation of the modern world.,It is the universal claimnthat many Western elites,are making about their politicalnsystem, the hubris,,that is at the heartnof the West's current ills.,If they would spendnjust a little less time,on trying to force their way onto others,,and a little bit morenon political reform at home,,they might give their democracyna better chance.,China's political modelnwill never supplant,electoral democracy,nbecause unlike the latter,,it doesn't pretend to be universal.,It cannot be exported. Butnthat is the point precisely.,The significance of China's example,is not that it provides an alternative,,but the demonstrationnthat alternatives exist.,Let us draw to a close thisnera of meta-narratives.,Communism and democracy maynboth be laudable ideals,,but the era of their dogmaticnuniversalism is over.,Let us stop tellingnpeople and our children,there's only one way to govern ourselves,and a singular future towards which,all societies must evolve.,It is wrong. It is irresponsible.,And worst of all, it is boring.,Let universality make way for plurality.,Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.,Are we brave enough to welcome it?,Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.,Bruno Giussani: Eric, staynwith me for a couple of minutes,,because I want to ask youna couple of questions.,I think many here, and in generalnin Western countries,,would agree with your statementnabout analysis,of democratic systemsnbecoming dysfunctional,,but at the same time,nmany would kind of find,unsettling the thoughtnthat there is an unelected,authority that, without any formnof oversight or consultation,,decides what the national interest is.,What is the mechanism in the Chinese model,that allows people to say, actually,,the national interestnas you defined it is wrong?,EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama,nthe political scientist,,called the Chinese systemn"responsive authoritarianism.",It's not exactly right,nbut I think it comes close.,So I know the largest publicnopinion survey company,in China, okay?,Do you know who their biggest client is?,The Chinese government.,Not just from the central government,,the city government,nthe provincial government,,to the most local neighborhood districts.,They conduct surveys all the time.,Are you happy with the garbage collection?,Are you happy with the generalndirection of the country?,So there is, in China, therenis a different kind of mechanism,to be responsive to the demandsnand the thinking of the people.,My point is, I think we should get unstuck,from the thinkingnthat there's only one political system --,election, election, election --,that could make it responsive.,I'm not sure, actually, elections produce,responsive governmentnanymore in the world.,(Applause),BG: Many seem to agree.,One of the features of a democratic system,is a space for civilnsociety to express itself.,And you have shown figuresnabout the support,that the governmentnand the authorities have in China.,But then you've justnmentioned other elements,like, you know, big challenges,nand there are, of course,,a lot of other data that gonin a different direction:,tens of thousands of unrests and protests,and environmental protests, etc.,So you seem to suggest the Chinese model,doesn't have a space outside of the Party,for civil society to express itself.,EXL: There's a vibrantncivil society in China,,whether it's environment or what-have-you.,But it's different. Younwouldn't recognize it.,Because, by Western definitions,na so-called civil society,has to be separate or even in opposition,to the political system,,but that concept is aliennfor Chinese culture.,For thousands of years,nyou have civil society,,yet they are consistent and coherent,and part of a political order, and I think,it's a big cultural difference.,BG: Eric, thank you for sharingnthis with TED. EXL: Thank you.An image is worth more than a thousand words,,so I'm going to start my talk,by stop talking and show you a few images,that I recently captured. 
 So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,,and I feel like I should stop here. 
 (Laughter) 
 At the same time, I probably owe you,some explanation,about the images that you just saw.,What I am trying to do as a photographer,,as an artist, is to bring the world,of art and science together.,Whether it is an image of a soap bubble,captured at the very moment where it's bursting,,as you can see in this image,,whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads,of oil paint,,strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,,or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,,I'm always trying to link those two fields together. 
 What I find very intriguing about those two,is that they both look at the same thing:,They are a response to their surroundings.,And yet, they do it in a very different way.,If you look at science on one hand,,science is a very rational approach,to its surroundings,,whereas art on the other hand,is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.,What I am trying to do is I'm trying,to bring those two views into one,so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart,but also to the viewer's brain.,Let me demonstrate this based on three projects. 
 The first one has to do with making sound visible.,Now as you may know,,sound travels in waves,,so if you have a speaker,,a speaker actually does nothing else,than taking the audio signal,,transform it into a vibration,,which is then transported through the air,,is captured by our ear,,and transformed into an audio signal again.,Now I was thinking,,how can I make those sound waves visible?,So I came up with the following setup.,I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil,of plastic on top of that speaker,,and then I added tiny little crystals,on top of that speaker.,And now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,,it would cause the crystals to move up and down.,Now this happens very fast,,in the blink of an eye,,so, together with LG, we captured this motion,with a camera that is able,to capture more than 3,000 frames per second.,Let me show you what this looks like. 
 (Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much.,I agree, it looks pretty amazing. 
 But I have to tell you a funny story.,I got an indoor sunburn doing this,while shooting in Los Angeles.,Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn,just on any of the beaches,,but I got mine indoors,,and what happened is that,,if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,,you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.,So we had this speaker set up,,and we had the camera facing it,,and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,,and I would set up the speaker,,put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,,and we would do this over and over again,,and it was until midday that I realized,that I had a completely red face,because of the lights pointing at the speaker.,What was so funny about it was that,the speaker was only coming from the right side,,so the right side of my face was completely red,and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera,for the rest of the week. 
 Let me now turn to another project,which involves less harmful substances.,Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?,Ah, some of you have. Excellent.,Should I skip that part? 
 (Laughter) 
 Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.,It's a liquid that is completely black.,It's got an oily consistency.,And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,,which makes it magnetic.,So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,,it would change its appearance. 
 Now I've got a live demonstration over here,to show this to you.,So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,,and underneath that plate, there is a magnet.,Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid,to that magnet. 
 Let's just slightly move it to the right,and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent. 
 So what you can see now is that,the ferrofluid has formed spikes.,This is due to the attraction and the repulsion,of the individual particles inside the liquid.,Now this looks already quite interesting,,but let me now add some watercolors to it.,Those are just standard watercolors,that you would paint with.,You wouldn't paint with syringes,,but it works just the same.,So what happened now is,,when the watercolor was flowing into the structure,,the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.,That's because the ferrofluid itself,is hydrophobic.,That means it doesn't mix with the water.,And at the same time, it tries to maintain its position,above the magnet,,and therefore, it creates those amazing-looking,structures of channels and tiny little ponds,of colorful water paint.,So that was the second project. 
 Let me now turn to the last project,,which involves,the national beverage of Scotland.,(Laughter) 
 This image, and also this one,,were made using whiskey.,Now you might ask yourself,,how did he do that?,Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey,and then draw the hallucination he got,from being drunk onto paper?,I can assure you I was fully conscious,while I was taking those pictures. 
 Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,,and alcohol has got some very interesting properties.,Maybe you have experienced,some of those properties before,,but I am talking about the physical properties,,not the other ones.,So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules,would spread in the air,,and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.,And at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.,And it was with those two properties,that I was able to create the images,that you're seeing right now. 
 Let me demonstrate this over here.,And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.,It's got nothing in it.,And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen,and whiskey.,Add some more.,Now we just wait for a few seconds,for the molecules to spread inside the bottle.,And now, let's set that on fire. 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's all that happens.,It goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.,I could do it again to show it one more time,,but some would argue that this is a complete waste,of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it. 
 But let me show you a slow motion,in a completely darkened room,of what I just showed you in this live demonstration.,So what happened is that the flame,traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,,burning the mix of the air molecules,and the alcohol.,So the images that you saw at the beginning,,they are actually a flame stopped in time,while it is traveling through the bottle,,and you have to imagine,it was flipped around 180 degrees.,So that's how those images were made. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So, I have now showed you three projects,,and you might ask yourself, what is it good for?,What's the idea behind it?,Is it just a waste of whiskey?,Is it just some strange materials?,Those three projects, they're based on very simple,scientific phenomena,,such as magnetism, the sound waves,,or over here, the physical properties of a substance,,and what I'm trying to do,is I'm trying to use these phenomena,and show them in a poetic and unseen way,,and therefore invite the viewer,to pause for a moment,and think about all the beauty,that is constantly surrounding us. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Technology can change our understanding of nature. 
 Take for example the case of lions.,For centuries, it's been said that female lions,do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,,and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.,You've heard this too, I can tell.,Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign,in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.,Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars,on male and female lions,,and we mapped their hunting behavior,from the air.,The lower left shows a lion sizing up,a herd of impala for a kill,,and the right shows what I call,the lion viewshed.,That's how far the lion can see in all directions,until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.,And what we found,is that male lions are not the lazy hunters,we thought them to be.,They just use a different strategy.,Whereas the female lions hunt,out in the open savanna,over long distances, usually during the day,,male lions use an ambush strategy,in dense vegetation, and often at night.,This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds,of male lions on the left,and females on the right.,Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation,,and the white are wide open spaces.,And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level,of hunting male and female lions.,All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding,of the very spooky conditions under which,male lions do their hunting. 
 I bring up this example to begin,,because it emphasizes how littlenwe know about nature.,There's been a huge amount of work done so far,to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,,and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,,as shown in red on the slide.,I find it ironic that we're doing so much,,yet these areas are fairly unknown to science.,So how can we save what we don't understand? 
 Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer,with a background in physics and chemistry,and biology and a lot of other boring subjects,,but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know,about our planet.,So I created this,,the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.,It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,,but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos,of high-tech sensors, computers,,and a very motivated staff,of Earth scientists and pilots.,Two of our instruments are very unique:,one is called an imaging spectrometer,that can actually measure the chemical composition,of plants as we fly over them.,Another one is a set of lasers,,very high-powered lasers,,that fire out of the bottom of the plane,,sweeping across the ecosystem,and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second,in high-resolution 3D.,Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge,in San Francisco, not far from where I live.,Although we flew straight over this bridge,,we imaged it in 3D, captured its color,in just a few seconds.,But the real power of the CAO,is its ability to capture the actual building blocks,of ecosystems.,This is a small town in the Amazon,,imaged with the CAO.,We can slice through our data,and see, for example, the 3D structure,of the vegetation and the buildings,,or we can use the chemical information,to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing,as we fly over them.,The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.,And we can see biodiversity in ways,that you never could have imagined.,This is what a rainforest might look like,as you fly over it in a hot air balloon.,This is how we see a rainforest,,in kaleidoscopic color that tells us,that there are many species living with one another.,But you have to remember that these trees,are literally bigger than whales,,and what that means is thatnthey're impossible to understand,just by walking on the ground below them.,So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,,and this tells us not only the species,that are living in the canopy,,but it tells us a lot of information,about the rest of the speciesnthat occupy the rainforest. 
 Now I created the CAO,in order to answer questions that have proven,extremely challenging to answernfrom any other vantage point,,such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.,I want to share three of thosenquestions with you today.,The first questions is,,how do we manage our carbon reserves,in tropical forests?,Tropical forests contain a hugenamount of carbon in the trees,,and we need to keep that carbon in those forests,if we're going to avoid any further global warming.,Unfortunately, global carbon emissions,from deforestation,now equals the global transportation sector.,That's all ships, airplanes, trains nand automobiles combined.,So it's understandable that policy negotiators,have been working hard to reduce deforestation,,but they're doing it on landscapes,that are hardly known to science.,If you don't know where the carbon is exactly,,in detail, how can you know what you're losing?,Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.,With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks,of tropical forests in utter detail.,The red shows, obviously,nclosed-canopy tropical forest,,and then you see the cookie cutting,,or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.,It's like cutting a cake except this cake,is about whale deep.,And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest,and the trees at the same time.,And what's amazing is, even though we flew,very high above this forest,,later on in analysis, we can go in,and actually experience the treetrops,,leaf by leaf, branch by branch,,just as the other species that live in this forest,experience it along with the trees themselves. 
 We've been using the technology to explore,and to actually put out the first carbon geographies,in high resolution,in faraway places like the Amazon Basin,and not-so-faraway places like the United States,and Central America.,What I'm going to do is I'm going to take younon a high-resolution, first-time tour,of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.,The colors are going to be going from red to blue.,Red is extremely high carbon stocks,,your largest cathedral forests you can imagine,,and blue are very low carbon stocks.,And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,,totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography,until today.,We can fly to this area in northern Peru,and see super high carbon stocks in red,,and the Amazon River and floodplain,cutting right through it.,We can go to an area of utter devastation,caused by deforestation in blue,,and the virus of deforestationnspreading out in orange.,We can also fly to the southern Andes,to see the tree line and see exactly how,the carbon geography ends,as we go up into the mountain system.,And we can go to the biggest swampnin the western Amazon.,It's a watery dreamworld,akin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar.",We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,,Panama, and see also a huge range,of carbon variation,,from high in red to low in blue.,Unfortunately, most of the carbonnis lost in the lowlands,,but what you see that's left,,in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,,is the stuff that's up in the mountains.,One interesting exception to this,is right in the middle of your screen.,You're seeing the buffer zonenaround the Panama Canal.,That's in the reds and yellows.,The canal authorities are using force,to protect their watershed and global commerce.,This kind of carbon mapping,has transformed conservation,and resource policy development.,It's really advancing our ability to save forests,and to curb climate change. 
 My second question: How do wenprepare for climate change,in a place like the Amazon rainforest?,Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time,in these places, and we're seeingnthe climate changing already.,Temperatures are increasing,,and what's really happening isnwe're getting a lot of droughts,,recurring droughts.,The 2010 mega-drought is shown here,with red showing an areanabout the size of Western Europe.,The Amazon was so dry in 2010,that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself,dried up partially, as you see in the photo,in the lower portion of the slide.,What we found is that in very remote areas,,these droughts are having a big negative impact,on tropical forests.,For example, these are all of the dead trees in red,that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.,This area happens to be on the border,of Peru and Brazil,,totally unexplored,,almost totally unknown scientifically. 
 So what we think, as Earth scientists,,is species are going to have to migrate,with climate change from the east in Brazil,all the way west into the Andes,and up into the mountains,in order to minimize theirnexposure to climate change.,One of the problems with this is that humans,are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.,Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash,in the forest created by gold miners.,You see the forest in green in 3D,,and you see the effects of gold mining,down below the soil surface.,Species have nowhere to migratenin a system like this, obviously. 
 If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.,It's an amazing experience every time,,no matter where you go.,You're going to probably see it this way, on a river.,But what happens is a lot of times,the rivers hide what's really going on,back in the forest itself.,We flew over this same river,,imaged the system in 3D.,The forest is on the left.,And then we can digitally remove the forest,and see what's going on below the canopy.,And in this case, we found gold mining activity,,all of it illegal,,set back away from the river's edge,,as you'll see in those strange pockmarks,coming up on your screen on the right.,Don't worry, we're working with the authorities,to deal with this and many, many other problems,in the region. 
 So in order to put together a conservation plan,for these unique, important corridors,like the western Amazonnand the Andes Amazon corridor,,we have to start making,geographically explicit plans now.,How do we do that if we don't knownthe geography of biodiversity in the region,,if it's so unknown to science?,So what we've been doing is using,the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO,to map for the first time the biodiversity,of the Amazon rainforest.,Here you see actual data showingndifferent species in different colors.,Reds are one type of species, blues are another,,and greens are yet another.,And when we take this together and scale up,to the regional level,,we get a completely new geography,of biodiversity unknown prior to this work.,This tells us where the big biodiversity changes,occur from habitat to habitat,,and that's really important because it tells us,a lot about where species may migrate to,and migrate from as the climate shifts.,And this is the pivotal information that's needed,by decision makers to develop protected areas,in the context of their regional development plans. 
 And third and final question is,,how do we manage biodiversity on a planet,of protected ecosystems?,The example I started outnwith about lions hunting,,that was a study we did,behind the fence line of a protected area,in South Africa.,And the truth is, much of Africa's nature,is going to persist into the future,in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.,This puts incredible pressure and responsibility,on park management.,They need to do and make decisions,that will benefit all of the speciesnthat they're protecting.,Some of their decisions have really big impacts.,For example, how much and where,to use fire as a management tool?,Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants,,which may, if their populations get too large,,have a negative impact on the ecosystem,and on other species.,And let me tell you, these types of dynamics,really play out on the landscape.,In the foreground is an area with lots of fire,and lots of elephants:,wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.,As we cross this fence line, now we're getting,into an area that has had protection from fire,and zero elephants:,dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.,And in a place like Kruger,,the soaring elephant densities,are a real problem.,I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,,and there are no easy answers with this.,But what's good is thatnthe technology we've developed,and we're working with in South Africa, for example,,is allowing us to map everynsingle tree in the savanna,,and then through repeat flights,we're able to see which trees,are being pushed over by elephants,,in the red as you see on the screen,nand how much that's happening,in different types of landscapes in the savanna.,That's giving park managers,a very first opportunity to use,tactical management strategiesnthat are more nuanced,and don't lead to those extremesnthat I just showed you.,So really, the way we're looking,at protected areas nowadays,is to think of it as tending to a circle of life,,where we have fire management,,elephant management, those impacts onnthe structure of the ecosystem,,and then those impacts,affecting everything from insects,up to apex predators like lions. 
 Going forward, I plan to greatly expand,the airborne observatory.,I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit,so we can manage the entire planet,with technologies like this.,Until then, you're going to find me flying,in some remote place that you've never heard of.,I just want to end by saying that technology is,absolutely critical to managing our planet,,but even more important is the understanding,and wisdom to apply it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards,from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.,My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,,was going berserk,,and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,,and frantic. My God. 
 I was there covering the 25th anniversary,of the world's worst nuclear accident,,as you can see by the look on my face,,reluctantly so, but with good reason,,because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days,back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation,as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,,and the sarcophagus, which is the covering,over reactor number four,,which was hastily built 27 years ago,,now sits cracked and rusted,and leaking radiation. 
 So I was filming.,I just wanted to get the job done,and get out of there fast.,But then, I looked into the distance,,and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,,and I'm thinking, who could be living here?,I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,,are among the most highly contaminated on Earth,,and the reactor sits at the the center of,a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,,and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.,You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,,you have to have a government minder,,and there's draconian radiation rules,and constant contamination monitoring.,The point being, no human being,should be living anywhere near the dead zone.,But they are. 
 It turns out an unlikely community,of some 200 people are living inside the zone.,They're called self-settlers.,And almost all of them are women,,the men having shorter lifespans,in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,,if not radiation.,Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated,at the time of the accident,,but not everybody accepted that fate.,The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,,are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities,and, it would seem, common sense,,and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.,They did so illegally.,As one woman put it to a soldier,who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,,"Shoot me and dig the grave.,Otherwise, I'm going home." 
 Now why would they return to such deadly soil?,I mean, were they unaware of the risks,or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?,The thing is, they see their lives,and the risks they run decidedly differently. 
 Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,,eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,,totally contaminated.,Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,,but a few are left like this,,kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.,Others have a few residents in them,,one or two "babushkas," or "babas,",which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.,Another village might have six or seven residents.,So this is the strange demographic of the zone --,isolated alone together. 
 And when I made my way to that piping chimney,I'd seen in the distance,,I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.,She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,,population eight.,(Laughter),And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,,"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does." 
 And you have to remember, these women have,survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.,Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,,killed millions of Ukrainians,,and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,,who came through slashing, burning, raping,,and in fact many of these women,were shipped to Germany as forced labor.,So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,,Chernobyl happened,,they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy,that was invisible.,So they returned to their villages,and are told they're going to get sick and die soon,,but five happy years, their logic goes,,is better than 10 stuck in a high rise,on the outskirts of Kiev,,separated from the graves of their mothers,and fathers and babies,,the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.,For them, environmental contamination,may not be the worst sort of devastation.,It turns out this holds true,for other species as well.,Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned,to the region in force,,the very real, very negative effects of radiation,being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus,of humans.,The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life. 
 And there is a kind of heroic resilience,,a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those,who start their day at 5 a.m.,pulling water from a well,and end it at midnight,poised to beat a bucket with a stick,and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,,their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.,And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.,"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?",I mean, what about their health?,The benefits of hardy, physical living,,but an environment made toxic,by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.,It's incredibly difficult to parse.,Health studies from the region,are conflicting and fraught.,The World Health Organization,puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths,at 4,000, eventually.,Greenpeace and other organizations,put that number in the tens of thousands.,Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers,are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees,suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:,higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,,unemployment and, importantly,,disrupted social networks. 
 Now, like many of you,,I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.,Home is a transient concept.,I have a deeper connection to my laptop,than any bit of soil.,So it's hard for us to understand, but home,is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,,and connection to the land is palpable.,And perhaps because these Ukrainian women,were schooled under the Soviets,and versed in the Russian poets,,aphorisms about these ideas,slip from their mouths all the time. 
 "If you leave, you die." 
 "Those who left are worse off now.,They are dying of sadness." 
 "Motherland is motherland. I will never leave." 
 What sounds like faith, soft faith,,may actually be fact,,because the surprising truth --,I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be,that these women who returned to their homes,and have lived on some of the most radioactive land,on Earth for the last 27 years,,have actually outlived their counterparts,who accepted relocation,,by some estimates up to 10 years. 
 How could this be?,Here's a theory: Could it be,that those ties to ancestral soil,,the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,,actually affect longevity?,The power of motherland,so fundamental to that part of the world,seems palliative.,Home and community are forces,that rival even radiation. 
 Now radiation or not,,these women are at the end of their lives.,In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,,and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,,full only of animals and occasionally,daring, flummoxed scientists.,But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,,whose numbers have been halved,in the three years I've known them,,will leave us with powerful new templates,to think about and grapple with,,about the relative nature of risk,,about transformative connections to home,,and about the magnificent tonic,of personal agency and self-determination. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Writing biography is a strange thing to do.,It's a journey into the foreign territory,of somebody else's life,,a journey, an exploration that can take you places,you never dreamed of going,and still can't quite believe you've been,,especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew,and the life you've been exploring,is that of Muhammad. 
 Five years ago, for instance,,I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle,to what I knew was an impossible question:,What actually happened,one desert night,,half the world and almost half of history away?,What happened, that is,,on the night in the year 610,when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran,on a mountain just outside Mecca?,This is the core mystical moment of Islam,,and as such, of course,,it defies empirical analysis.,Yet the question wouldn't let go of me.,I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,,just asking it could be seen,as pure chutzpah.,(Laughter),And I plead guilty as charged,,because all exploration, physical or intellectual,,is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,,of crossing boundaries. 
 Still, some boundaries are larger than others.,So a human encountering the divine,,as Muslims believe Muhammad did,,to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact,but of wishful fiction,,and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational. 
 Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts,we have of that night,,what struck me even more than what happened,was what did not happen.,Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain,as though walking on air.,He did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!",and "Bless the Lord!",He did not radiate light and joy.,There were no choirs of angels,,no music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,,no golden aura surrounding him,,no sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role,as the messenger of God.,That is, he did none of the things,that might make it easy to cry foul,,to put down the whole story as a pious fable.,Quite the contrary.,In his own reported words,,he was convinced at first,that what had happened couldn't have been real.,At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination --,a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,,or his own mind working against him.,At worst, possession --,that he'd been seized by an evil jinn,,a spirit out to deceive him,,even to crush the life out of him.,In fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,,possessed by a jinn,,that when he found himself still alive,,his first impulse was to finish the job himself,,to leap off the highest cliff,and escape the terror of what he'd experienced,by putting an end to all experience. 
 So the man who fled down the mountain that night,trembled not with joy,but with a stark, primordial fear.,He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.,And that panicked disorientation,,that sundering of everything familiar,,that daunting awareness of something,beyond human comprehension,,can only be called a terrible awe. 
 This might be somewhat difficult to grasp,now that we use the word "awesome",to describe a new app or a viral video.,With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,,we're protected from real awe.,We close the doors and hunker down,,convinced that we're in control,,or, at least, hoping for control.,We do our best to ignore the fact that,we don't always have it,,and that not everything can be explained.,Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,,whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night,came from inside himself or from outside,,what's clear is that he did experience them,,and that he did so with a force that would shatter,his sense of himself and his world,and transform this otherwise modest man,into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.,Fear was the only sane response,,the only human response. 
 Too human for some,,like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that,the account of his wanting to kill himself,shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact,that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.,They insist that he never doubted,for even a single moment, let alone despaired.,Demanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate,human imperfection.,Yet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?,As I read those early accounts, I realized it was,precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,,that allowed me to begin to see him in full,,to accord him the integrity of reality.,And the more I thought about it,,the more it made sense that he doubted,,because doubt is essential to faith. 
 If this seems a startling idea at first,,consider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,,is the heart of the matter.,Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,,but absolute, heartless conviction.,You're certain that you possess the Truth --,inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T --,and this certainty quickly devolves,into dogmatism and righteousness,,by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride,in being so very right,,in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.,It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history,that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists,is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists,known as Crusaders:,"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless.",Doubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism,is in fact the opposite of faith.,In effect, they are the infidels.,Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes,,they have no questions, only answers.,They found the perfect antidote to thought,and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.,They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob,wrestling through the night with the angel,,or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,,or like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,,but throughout his years as a prophet,,with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,,and condemning those who most loudly proclaim,that they know everything there is to know,and that they and they alone are right. 
 And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,,have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.,We've allowed Judaism to be claimed,by violently messianic West Bank settlers,,Christianity by homophobic hypocrites,and misogynistic bigots,,Islam by suicide bombers.,And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that,no matter whether they claim to be Christians,,Jews or Muslims,,militant extremists are none of the above.,They're a cult all their own, blood brothers,steeped in other people's blood. 
 This isn't faith.,It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.,We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.,It's difficult and stubborn.,It involves an ongoing struggle,,a continual questioning of what we think we know,,a wrestling with issues and ideas.,It goes hand in hand with doubt,,in a never-ending conversation with it,,and sometimes in conscious defiance of it. 
 And this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,,can still have faith.,I have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East,is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence,to the contrary.,I'm not convinced of this.,I can hardly say I believe it.,I can only have faith in it,,commit myself, that is, to the idea of it,,and I do this precisely because of the temptation,to throw up my hands in resignation,and retreat into silence. 
 Because despair is self-fulfilling.,If we call something impossible,,we act in such a way that we make it so.,And I, for one, refuse to live that way.,In fact, most of us do,,whether we're atheist or theist,or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,,what drives us is that, despite our doubts,and even because of our doubts,,we reject the nihilism of despair.,We insist on faith in the future,and in each other.,Call this naive if you like.,Call it impossibly idealistic if you must.,But one thing is sure:,Call it human. 
 Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world,without such faith, without the refusal,to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?,I think not.,After keeping company with him as a writer,for the past five years, I can't see,that he'd be anything but utterly outraged,at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak,and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.,He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population,because of their gender.,He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.,He'd call out terrorism for what it is,,not only criminal but an obscene travesty,of everything he believed in and struggled for.,He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life,takes the life of all humanity.,Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.,And he'd commit himself fully,to the hard and thorny process of making peace. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)This is our life with bees,,and this is our life without bees.,Bees are the most important pollinators,of our fruits and vegetables and flowers,and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.,More than one third of the world's crop production,is dependent on bee pollination. 
 But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there,pollinating our food intentionally.,They're out there because they need to eat.,Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet,from pollen,and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.,They're flower-feeders,,and as they move from flower to flower,,basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,,they end up providing this valuable pollination service.,In parts of the world where there are no bees,,or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,,people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.,These people are moving pollen from flower to flower,with a paintbrush.,Now this business of hand pollination,is actually not that uncommon.,Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers,with a hand-held vibrator.,Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter),Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower,is held very securely within,the male part of the flower, the anther,,and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.,So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world,that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,,and they do this by shaking their flight muscles,at a frequency similar to the musical note C.,So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,,and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,,and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,,and she takes it home as food.,Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies,inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes,because they get much more efficient pollination,when it's done naturally,and they get better quality tomatoes. 
 So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,,to care about bees.,There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,,and they're absolutely gorgeous.,These bees spend the majority of their life cycle,hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem,and very few of these beautiful species,have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees. 
 Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative,for the other 19,900-plus species,because there's something about honeybees,that draws people into their world.,Humans have been drawn to honeybees,since early recorded history,,mostly to harvest their honey,,which is an amazing natural sweetener. 
 I got drawn into the honeybee world,completely by a fluke.,I was 18 years old and bored,,and I picked up a book in the library on bees,and I spent the night reading it.,I had never thought about insects,living in complex societies.,It was like the best of science fiction come true.,And even stranger, there were these people,,these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,,and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.,So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,,a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.,And I was permanently hooked. 
 Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,,where the colony is the organism,and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000,individual bee organisms.,Now this society has no central authority.,Nobody's in charge.,So how they come to collective decisions,,and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,,how they communicate where the flowers are,,all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.,My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,,is their system of healthcare.,So bees have social healthcare.,So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.,For example, we study hygiene,,where some bees are able to locate and weed out,sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,,and it keeps the colony healthy.,And more recently, we've been studying resins,that bees collect from plants.,So bees fly to some plants and they scrape,these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,,and they take them back to the nest,where they cement them into the nest architecture,where we call it propolis.,We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.,It's a natural antibiotic.,It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs,within the colony,,and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.,Humans have known about the power of propolis,since biblical times.,We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies,for human medicine,,but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.,So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses,that have kept them healthy and thriving,for over 50 million years. 
 So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies,were reported to be dying en masse,,first in the United States,,it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.,In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,,we know we can't afford to lose bees.,So what's going on?,Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,,and I'll go through each of these.,The bottom line is,,bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape,and a dysfunctional food system. 
 Now we have the best data on honeybees,,so I'll use them as an example.,In the United States, bees in fact have been,in decline since World War II.,We have half the number of managed hives,in the United States now compared to 1945.,We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.,And the reason is, after World War II,,we changed our farming practices.,We stopped planting cover crops.,We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,,which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,,and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.,Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.,And after World War II, we started using herbicides,to kill off the weeds in our farms.,Many of these weeds are flowering plants,that bees require for their survival.,And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.,Now we talk about food deserts,,places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.,The very farms that used to sustain bees,are now agricultural food deserts,,dominated by one or two plant species,like corn and soybeans.,Since World War II, we have been systematically,eliminating many of the flowering plants,that bees need for their survival.,And these monocultures extend even to crops,that are good for bees, like almonds.,Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,,hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,,and also because the pollen in an almond blossom,is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.,Now, the scale of almond monoculture,demands that most of our nation's bees,,over 1.5 million hives of bees,,be transported across the nation,to pollinate this one crop.,And they're trucked in in semi-loads,,and they must be trucked out,,because after bloom, the almond orchards,are a vast and flowerless landscape. 
 Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,,and we're planting more crops that need them.,There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production,that requires bee pollination. 
 And then there's pesticides.,After World War II, we started using pesticides,on a large scale, and this became necessary,because of the monocultures that put out a feast,for crop pests.,Recently, researchers from Penn State University,have started looking at the pesticide residue,in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,,and they've found that every batch of pollen,that a honeybee collects,has at least six detectable pesticides in it,,and this includes every class of insecticides,,herbicides, fungicides,,and even inert and unlabeled ingredients,that are part of the pesticide formulation,that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.,This small bee is holding up a large mirror.,How much is it going to take to contaminate humans? 
 One of these class of insecticides,,the neonicontinoids,,is making headlines around the world right now.,You've probably heard about it.,This is a new class of insecticides.,It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,,a leaf-eating insect,,would take a bite of the plant,and get a lethal dose and die.,If one of these neonics, we call them,,is applied in a high concentration,,such as in this ground application,,enough of the compound moves through the plant,and gets into the pollen and the nectar,,where a bee can consume, in this case,,a high dose of this neurotoxin,that makes the bee twitch and die.,In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,,it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,,and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant,and gets into the pollen and nectar,,and if a bee consumes this lower dose,,either nothing happens,or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented,and she may not find her way home.,And on top of everything else, bees have,their own set of diseases and parasites.,Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.,It's called varroa destructor.,It's aptly named.,It's this big, blood-sucking parasite,that compromises the bee's immune system,and circulates viruses. 
 Let me put this all together for you.,I don't know what it feels like to a bee,to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,,and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,,but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,,and I know how difficult it is for me to get,to the grocery store to get good nutrition.,But what if I lived in a food desert?,And what if I had to travel a long distance,to get to the grocery store,,and I finally got my weak body out there,and I consumed, in my food,,enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,,that I couldn't find my way home?,And this is what we mean by multiple,and interacting causes of death. 
 And it's not just our honeybees.,All of our beautiful wild species of bees,are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.,These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.,They're providing the pollination insurance,alongside our honeybees.,We need all of our bees. 
 So what are we going to do?,What are we going to do about this big bee bummer,that we've created?,It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.,Every one of you out there can help bees,in two very direct and easy ways.,Plant bee-friendly flowers,,and don't contaminate these flowers,,this bee food, with pesticides.,So go online and search for flowers,that are native to your area and plant them.,Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.,Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,,in your boulevards.,Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,,community spaces, meadows.,Set aside farmland.,We need a beautiful diversity of flowers,that blooms over the entire growing season,,from spring to fall.,We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,,but also for migrating butterflies and birds,and other wildlife.,And we need to think carefully about putting back in,cover crops to nourish our soil,and nourish our bees.,And we need to diversify our farms.,We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows,to disrupt the agricultural food desert,and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system,that we've created. 
 So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure,to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --,but when bees have access to good nutrition,,we have access to good nutrition,through their pollination services.,And when bees have access to good nutrition,,they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,,their healthcare,,that they have relied on for millions of years.,So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,,is that every one of us needs to behave,a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,,where each of our individual actions,can contribute to a grand solution,,an emergent property,,that's much greater than the mere sum,of our individual actions.,So let the small act of planting flowers,and keeping them free of pesticides,be the driver of large-scale change. 
 On behalf of the bees, thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.,The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,,is there any sign of things bottoming out?,What's your hope/depression level on this? 
 Maria Spivak: Yeah.,At least in the United States,,an average of 30 percent of all bee hives,are lost every winter.,About 20 years ago,,we were at a 15-percent loss.,So it's getting precarious. 
 CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --nMS: Yes, thirty percent a year. 
 CA: Thirty percent a year.nMS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies,and so they can maintain the same number,,they can recuperate some of their loss. 
 We're kind of at a tipping point.,We can't really afford to lose that many more.,We need to be really appreciative,of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers. 
 CA: Thank you. 
 (Applause)What is so special about the human brain?,Why is it that we study other animals,instead of them studying us?,What does a human brain have or do,that no other brain does?,When I became interestednin these questions about 10 years ago,,scientists thought they knewnwhat different brains were made of.,Though it was based on very little evidence,,many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,,including the human brain,,were made in the same way,,with a number of neurons that was always,proportional to the size of the brain.,This means that two brains of the same size,,like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,,should have similar numbers of neurons.,Now, if neurons are the functional,information processing units of the brain,,then the owners of these two brains,should have similar cognitive abilities.,And yet, one is a chimp,,and the other is a cow.,Now maybe cows have a really rich,internal mental life and are so smart,that they choose not to let us realize it,,but we eat them.,I think most people will agree,that chimps are capable of much more complex,,elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.,So this is a first indication that the,"all brains are made the same way" scenario,is not quite right. 
 But let's play along.,If all brains were made the same way,and you were to compare animalsnwith brains of different sizes,,larger brains should always have more neurons,than smaller brains,nand the larger the brain,,the more cognitively able its owner should be.,So the largest brain around should also be,the most cognitively able.,And here comes the bad news:,Our brain, not the largest one around.,It seems quite vexing.,Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,,but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,,and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,,which is why scientists used to resort to saying,that our brain must be special,to explain our cognitive abilities.,It must be really extraordinary,,an exception to the rule.,Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,,and it could be better, for example,,in that it seems larger than it should be,,with a much larger cerebral cortexnthan we should have,for the size of our bodies.,So that would give us extra cortex,to do more interesting thingsnthan just operating the body.,That's because the size of the brain,usually follows the size of the body.,So the main reason for saying that,our brain is larger than it should be,actually comes from comparing ourselves,to great apes.,Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,,so their brains should also be larger than ours,,but instead it's the other way around.,Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain. 
 The human brain also seems special,in the amount of energy that it uses.,Although it weighs only two percent of the body,,it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy,that your body requires to run per day.,That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,,just to keep your brain working. 
 So the human brain is larger than it should be,,it uses much more energy than it should,,so it's special.,And this is where the story started to bother me.,In biology, we look for rules,that apply to all animals and to life in general,,so why should the rules of evolution,apply to everybody else but not to us?,Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption,that all brains are made in the same way.,Maybe two brains of a similar size,can actually be made ofnvery different numbers of neurons.,Maybe a very large brain,does not necessarily have more neurons,than a more modest-sized brain.,Maybe the human brain nactually has the most neurons,of any brain, regardless of its size,,especially in the cerebral cortex.,So this to me became,the important question to answer:,how many neurons does the human brain have,,and how does that compare to other animals? 
 Now, you may have heard or read somewhere,that we have 100 billion neurons,,so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues,if they knew where this number came from.,But nobody did.,I've been digging through the literature,for the original reference for that number,,and I could never find it.,It seems that nobody had actually ever counted,the number of neurons in the human brain,,or in any other brain for that matter. 
 So I came up with my own waynto count cells in the brain,,and it essentially consists of,dissolving that brain into soup.,It works like this:,You take a brain, or parts of that brain,,and you dissolve it in detergent,,which destroys the cell membranes,but keeps the cell nuclei intact,,so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei,that looks like this,,like a clear soup.,This soup contains all the nuclei,that once were a mouse brain.,Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,,you can agitate it and make those nuclei,be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,,so that now by looking under the microscope,at just four or five samplesnof this homogeneous solution,,you can count nuclei, and therefore tell,how many cells that brain had.,It's simple, it's straightforward,,and it's really fast.,So we've used that method to count neurons,in dozens of different species so far,,and it turns out that all brains,are not made the same way.,Take rodents and primates, for instance:,In larger rodent brains, the average size,of the neuron increases,,so the brain inflates very rapidly,and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.,But primate brains gain neurons,without the average neuron becoming any larger,,which is a very economical way,to add neurons to your brain.,The result is that a primate brain,will always have more neurons thanna rodent brain of the same size,,and the larger the brain,,the larger this difference will be.,Well, what about our brain then?,We found that we have, on average,,86 billion neurons,,16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,,and if you consider that the cerebral cortex,is the seat of functions like,awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,,and that 16 billion is the most neurons,that any cortex has,,I think this is the simplest explanation,for our remarkable cognitive abilities.,But just as important is whatnthe 86 billion neurons mean.,Because we found that the relationship,between the size of the brainnand its number of neurons,could be described mathematically,,we could calculate what a human brain,would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.,So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons,would weigh 36 kilos.,That's not possible.,A brain that huge would be crushed,by its own weight,,and this impossible brain would go,in the body of 89 tons.,I don't think it looks like us. 
 So this brings us to a very importantnconclusion already,,which is that we are not rodents.,The human brain is not a large rat brain.,Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,,but that's not a fair comparison to make,,given that we know that we are not rodents.,We are primates,,so the correct comparison is to other primates.,And there, if you do the math,,you find that a generic primate,with 86 billion neurons,would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,,which seems just right,,in a body of some 66 kilos,,which in my case is exactly right,,which brings us to a very unsurprising,but still incredibly important conclusion:,I am a primate.,And all of you are primates. 
 And so was Darwin.,I love to think that Darwinnwould have really appreciated this.,His brain, like ours,,was made in the image of other primate brains. 
 So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,,but it is not special in its number of neurons.,It is just a large primate brain.,I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought,that should remind us of our place in nature. 
 Why does it cost so much energy, then?,Well, other people have figured out,how much energy the human brain,and that of other species costs,,and now that we knew how many neurons,each brain was made of, we could do the math.,And it turns out that both human,and other brains cost about the same,,an average of six calories nper billion neurons per day.,So the total energetic cost of a brain,is a simple, linear function,of its number of neurons,,and it turns out that the human brain,costs just as much energy as you would expect.,So the reason why the human brain,costs so much energy is simply because,it has a huge number of neurons,,and because we are primates,with many more neurons for a given body size,than any other animal,,the relative cost of our brain is large,,but just because we're primates,nnot because we're special. 
 Last question, then:,how did we come by thisnremarkable number of neurons,,and in particular, if great apes,are larger than we are,,why don't they have a larger brain nthan we do, with more neurons?,When we realized how much expensive it is,to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,,maybe there's a simple reason.,They just can't afford the energy,for both a large body nand a large number of neurons.,So we did the math.,We calculated on the one hand,how much energy a primate gets per day,from eating raw foods,,and on the other hand, how much energy,a body of a certain size costs,and how much energy a brain of ancertain number of neurons costs,,and we looked for the combinations,of body size and number of brain neurons,that a primate could afford,if it ate a certain number of hours per day. 
 And what we found is that,because neurons are so expensive,,there is a tradeoff betweennbody size and number of neurons.,So a primate that eats eight hours per day,can afford at most 53 billion neurons,,but then its body cannot be any bigger,than 25 kilos.,To weigh any more than that,,it has to give up neurons.,So it's either a large body,or a large number of neurons.,When you eat like a primate,,you can't afford both. 
 One way out of this metabolic limitation,would be to spend even more hours per day eating,,but that gets dangerous,,and past a certain point, it's just not possible.,Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,,afford about 30 billion neurons,by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,,and that seems to be about as much as they can do.,Nine hours of feeding per day,seems to be the practical limit for a primate. 
 What about us?,With our 86 billion neurons,and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,,we should have to spend over nine hours,per day every single day feeding,,which is just not feasible.,If we ate like a primate,,we should not be here. 
 How did we get here, then?,Well, if our brain costs just as much energy,as it should, and if we can't spend,every waking hour of the day feeding,,then the only alternative, really,,is to somehow get more energy,out of the same foods.,And remarkably, that matches exactly,what our ancestors are believed to have invented,one and a half million years ago,,when they invented cooking.,To cook is to use fire,to pre-digest foods outside of your body.,Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew,and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,,so that allows them to be completely digested,and absorbed in your gut,,which makes them yield much morenenergy in much less time.,So cooking frees time for us to do,much more interesting things with our day,and with our neurons,than just thinking about food,,looking for food, and gobbling down food,all day long. 
 So because of cooking, what once was,a major liability, this large,,dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,,could now become a major asset,,now that we could both afford nthe energy for a lot of neurons,and the time to do interesting things with them.,So I think this explains why the human brain,grew to become so large so fast in evolution,,all of the while remaining just a primate brain.,With this large brain now affordable by cooking,,we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,,agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,,electricity, refrigerators,,all of those things that nowadays,allow us to get all the energy we need,for the whole day in a single sitting,at your favorite fast food joint.,So what once was a solution,now became the problem,,and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food. 
 So what is the human advantage?,What is it that we have,that no other animal has?,My answer is that we have the largest number,of neurons in the cerebral cortex,,and I think that's the simplest explanation,for our remarkable cognitive abilities.,And what is it that we do that no other animal does,,and which I believe was fundamental,to allow us to reach that large,,largest number of neurons in the cortex?,In two words, we cook.,No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.,And I think that's how we got to become human. 
 Studying the human brain changed nthe way I think about food.,I now look at my kitchen,,and I bow to it,,and I thank my ancestors for coming up,with the invention that probably made us humans.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)The urban explosion,of the last years of economic boom,also produced dramatic marginalization,,resulting in the explosion of slums,in many parts of the world.,This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth,surrounded by sectors of poverty,and the socioeconomic inequalitiesnthey have engendered,is really at the center of today's urban crisis.,But I want to begin tonight,by suggesting that this urban crisis,is not only economic or environmental.,It's particularly a cultural crisis,,a crisis of the institutions,unable to reimagine the stupid ways,which we have been growing,,unable to challenge the oil-hungry,,selfish urbanization that have perpetuated,cities based on consumption,,from southern California to New York to Dubai.,So I just really want to share with you a reflection,that the future of cities today,depends less on buildings,and, in fact, depends more,on the fundamental reorganizationnof socioeconomic relations,,that the best ideas in the shaping,of the city in the future,will not come from enclaves of economic power,and abundance,,but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity,from which an urgent imagination,can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today. 
 And let me illustrate what I mean,by understanding or engaging sites of conflict,as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you,to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,,which has been the laboratory tonrethink my practice as an architect. 
 This is the wall, the border wall,,that separates San Diego and Tijuana,,Latin America and the United States,,a physical emblem,of exclusionary planning policies,that have perpetuated the division,of communities, jurisdictions,and resources across the world.,In this border region, we find,some of the wealthiest real estate,,as I once found in the edges of San Diego,,barely 20 minutes away,from some of the poorest nsettlements in Latin America.,And while these two cities have the same population,,San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana,in the last decades,,immediately thrusting us to confront,the tensions and conflicts,between sprawl and density,,which are at the center of today's discussion,about environmental sustainability.,So I've been arguing in the last years,that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot,to the sprawls of San Diego,when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,,that we should pay attention and learn,from the many migrant communities,on both sides of this border wall,so that we can translate their informal processes,of urbanization. 
 What do I mean by the informal in this case?,I'm really just talking about,the compendium of social practices of adaptation,that enable many of these migrant communities,to transgress imposed political and economic recipes,of urbanization.,I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence,of the bottom-up,,whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana,that build themselves, in fact,nwith the waste of San Diego,,or the many migrant neighborhoodsnin Southern California,that have begun to be retrofitted with difference,in the last decades. 
 So I've been interested as an artist,in the measuring, the observation,,of many of the trans-border informal flows,across this border:,in one direction, from south to north,,the flow of immigrants into the United States,,and from north to south the flow of waste,from southern California into Tijuana.,I'm referring to the recycling,of these old post-war bungalows,that Mexican contractors bring to the border,as American developers are disposing of them,in the process of building a more inflated version,of suburbia in the last decades.,So these are houses waiting to cross the border.,Not only people cross the border here,,but entire chunks of one city move to the next,,and when these houses are placednon top of these steel frames,,they leave the first floor to become the second,to be in-filled with more house,,with a small business.,This layering of spaces and economies,is very interesting to notice.,But not only houses, also small debris,from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.,Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires,that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.,But look at what people have done here in conditions,of socioeconomic emergency.,They have figured out how to peel off the tire,,how to thread it and interlock it,to construct a more efficient retaining wall.,Or the garage doors that are brought,from San Diego in trucks,to become the new skin of emergency housing,in many of these slums,surrounding the edges of Tijuana. 
 So while, as an architect,,this is a very compelling thing to witness,,this creative intelligence,,I also want to keep myself in check.,I don't want to romanticize poverty.,I just want to suggest,that this informal urbanization,is not just the image of precariousness,,that informality here, the informal,,is really a set of socioeconomicnand political procedures,that we could translate as artists,,that this is about a bottom-up urbanization,that performs.,See here, buildings are not important,just for their looks,,but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.,They truly perform as they transform through time,and as communities negotiate,the spaces and boundaries and resources. 
 So while waste flows southbound,,people go north in search of dollars,,and most of my research has had to do,with the impact of immigration,in the alteration of the homogeneity,of many neighborhoods in the United States,,particularly in San Diego.,And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest,that the future of Southern California,depends on the retrofitting,of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --,with the small programs,,social and economic.,I'm referring to how immigrants,,when they come to these neighborhoods,,they begin to alter the one-dimensionality,of parcels and properties,into more socially andneconomically complex systems,,as they begin to plug anninformal economy into a garage,,or as they build an illegal granny flat,to support an extended family.,This socioeconomic entrepreneurship,on the ground within these neighborhoods,really begins to suggest ways of translating that,into new, inclusive and more equitable,land use policies.,So many stories emerge from these dynamics,of alteration of space,,such as &quot;the informal Buddha,&quot;,which tells the story of a small house,that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,,but it was retrofitted in the end,into a Buddhist temple,,and in so doing,,this small house transforms or mutates,from a singular dwelling,into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic,and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood. 
 So these action neighborhoods, as I call them,,really become the inspiration,to imagine other interpretations of citizenship,that have less to do, in fact,,with belonging to the nation-state,,and more with upholding the notion of citizenship,as a creative act,that reorganizes institutional protocols,in the spaces of the city. 
 As an artist, I've been interested, in fact,,in the visualization of citizenship,,the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,,in order to narrativize the relationship,between social processes and spaces.,This is a story of a group of teenagers,that one night, a few months ago,,decided to invade this space under the freeway,to begin constructing their own skateboard park.,With shovels in hand, they started to dig.,Two weeks later, the police stopped them.,They barricaded the place,,and the teenagers were evicted,,and the teenagers decided to fight back,,not with bank cards or slogans,but with constructing a critical process.,The first thing they did was to recognize,the specificity of political jurisdiction,inscribed in that empty space.,They found out that they had been lucky,because they had not begun to dig,under Caltrans territoy.,Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,,so it would have been veryndifficult to negotiate with them.,They were lucky, they said, because they began,to dig under an arm of the freeway,that belongs to the local municipality.,They were also lucky, they said,,because they began to dig in a sort of,Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,,between port authority, airport authority,,two city districts, and a review board.,All these red lines are the invisible,political institutions that were inscribed,in that leftover empty space.,With this knowledge, these teenagers,as skaters confronted the city.,They came to the city attorney's office.,The city attorney told them,that in order to continue the negotiation,they had to become an NGO,,and of course they didn't know what an NGO was.,They had to talk to their friends in Seattle,who had gone through the same experience.,And they began to realize the necessity,to organize themselves even deeper,and began to fundraise, to organize budgets,,to really be aware of all the knowledge,embedded in the urban code in San Diego,so that they could begin to redefine,the very meaning of public space in the city,,expanding it to other categories.,At the end, the teenagers won the case,with that evidence, and they were able,to construct their skateboard park,under that freeway. 
 Now for many of you, this story,might seem trivial or naive.,For me as an architect, it has become,a fundamental narrative,,because it begins to teach me,that this micro-community,not only designed another category of public space,but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols,that were necessary to be inscribed in that space,for its long-term sustainability.,They also taught me,that similar to the migrant communities,on both sides of the border,,they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,,because they had to produce a process,that enabled them to reorganize resources,and the politics of the city.,In that act, that informal,,bottom-up act of transgression,,really began to trickle up,to transform top-down policy. 
 Now this journey from the bottom-up,to the transformation of the top-down,is where I find hope today.,And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations,with space and with policy,in many cities in the world,,in primarily the urgency,of a collective imagination,as these communities,reimagine their own forms of governance,,social organization, and infrastructure,,really is at the center,of the new formation,of democratic politics of the urban.,It is, in fact, this that could become the framework,for producing new social,and economic justice in the city.,I want to say this and emphasize it,,because this is the only way I see,that can enable us to move,from urbanizations of consumption,to neighborhoods of production today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here today to talk about social change,,not a new therapy or a new intervention,or a new way of working with kidsnor something like that,,but a new business model for social change,,a new way of tackling the problem. 
 In Britain, 63 percent of all men,who come out of short sentences from prison,re-offend again within a year.,Now how many previous offenses,do you think they have on average,managed to commit?,Forty-three.,And how many previous timesndo you think they've been in prison?,Seven. 
 So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,,and we said to the Ministry of Justice,,what's it worth to you,if fewer of these guys re-offend?,It's got to be worth something, right?,I mean, there's prison costs,,there's police costs, there's court costs,,all these things that you're spending money on,to deal with these guys. What's it worth? 
 Now, of course, we care about the social value.,Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,,cares about social stuff.,But we wanted to make the economic case,,because if we could make the economic case,,then the value of doing this nwould be completely compelling.,And if we can agree on both a value,and a way of measuring whether we've been,successful at reducing that re-offending,,then we can do something,we think rather interesting. 
 The idea is called the social impact bond.,Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,,if we can get the government to agree,,that we can create a contract where,they only pay if it worked.,So that means that they can try out new stuff,without the embarrassment,of having to pay if it didn't work,,which for still quite a lot of bits of government,,that's a serious issue. 
 Now, many of you may have noticed,there's a problem at this point,,and that is that it takes a long time to measure,whether those outcomes have happened.,So we have to raise some money.,We use the contract to raise money,from socially motivated investors.,Socially motivated investors:,there's an interesting idea, right?,But actually, there's a lot of people who,,if they're given the chance,,would love to invest in something,that does social good.,And here's the opportunity.,Do you want to also help government find,whether there's a better economic model,,not just leaving these guys to come out of prison,and waiting till they re-offendnand putting them back in again,,but actually working with them,to move to a different path,to end up with fewer crimes,and fewer victims? 
 So we find some investors,,and they pay for a set of services,,and if those services are successful,,then they improve outcomes,,and with those measured reductions in re-offending,,government saves money,,and with those savings,,they can pay outcomes.,And the investors do not just get their money back,,but they make a return. 
 So in March 2010, we signed,the first social impact bond,with the Ministry of Justice,around Peterborough Prison.,It was to work with 3,000 offenders,split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.,Now, each of those cohorts,would get measured over the two years,that they were coming out of prison.,They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,,six months to get through the court system,,and then they would be compared to a group,taken from the police national computer,,as similar as possible,,and we would get paid,providing we achieved a hurdle ratenof 10-percent reduction,,for every conviction event that didn't happen.,So we get paid for crimes saved.,Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction,across all three cohorts,,then the investors get a seven and a half percent,annualized return on their investment,,and if we do better than that,,they can get up to 13 percent,annualized return on their investment,,which is okay. 
 So everyone wins here, right?,The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program,and they only pay if it works.,Investors get two opportunities:,for the first time, they can invest in social change.,Also, they make a reasonable return,,and they also know that,first investors in these kinds of things,,they're going to have to believers.,They're going to have to care in the social program,,but if this builds a track record,over five or 10 years,,then you can widen that investor community,as more people have confidence in the product.,The service providers, well, for the first time,,they've got an opportunity to provide services,and grow the evidence for what they're doing,in a really constructive way and learn,and demonstrate the value of what they're doing,over five or six years, not just one or two,as often happens at the moment.,Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.,Now, the offenders, they also benefit.,Instead of just coming out of the prison,with 46 pounds in their pocket,,half of them not knowing where they're spending,their first night out of jail,,actually, someone meets them in prison,,learns about their issues,,meets them at the gate,,takes them through to somewhere to stay,,connects them to benefits,nconnects them to employment,,drug rehabilitation, mental health,,whatever's needed. 
 So let's think of another example:,working with children in care.,Social impact bonds work great,for any area where there is at the moment,very expensive provision that produces,poor outcomes for people.,So children in the state care,tend to do very badly.,Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level,of five GCSEs at 16,,against 58 percent of the wider population.,More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison,have spent some time in care.,And even more worryingly,,and this is a Home Office statistic,,70 percent of prostitutes,have spent some time in care.,The state is not a great parent.,But there are great programs,for adolescents who are on the edge of care,,and 30 percent of kids going into care,are adolescents. 
 So we set up a program with Essex County Council,to test out intensive family therapeutic support,for those families with adolescents,on the edge of the care system.,Essex only pays in the event,that it's saving them care costs.,Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.,That program started last month.,Others, around homelessness in London,,around youth and employment and education,elsewhere in the country.,There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,,and amazing levels of interest in this idea,all over the world.,So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds,into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.,Obama has suggested 300 million dollars,in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas,and structures to move it forward,,and a lot of other countries,are demonstrating considerable interest. 
 So what's caused this excitement?,Why is this so different for people?,Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,,is innovation.,It enables testing of new ideas,in a way that's less difficult for everybody. 
 The second piece it brings is rigor.,By working to outcomes, people really have to test,and bring data into the situationnthat one's dealing with.,So taking Peterborough as an example,,we add case management,across all of the different organizationsnthat we're working with,so they know,what actually has been done with different prisoners,,and at the same time they learn,from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,,because we pushed for the data,,what actually happens, whethernthey get re-arrested or not.,And we learn and adapt the program accordingly. 
 And this leads to the third element, which is new,,and that's flexibility.,Because normal contracting for things,,when you're spending government money,,you're spending our money, tax money,,and the people who are in charge nof that are very aware of it,so the temptation is to controlnexactly how you spend it.,Now any entrepreneur in the room knows,that version 1.0, the business plan,,is not the one that generally works.,So when you're trying to do something like this,,you need the flexibility to adapt the program.,And again, in Peterborough, we started off,with a program, but we also collected data,,and over the period of time,,we nuanced and changed that program,to add a range of other elements,,so that the service adapts,and we meet the needs of the long term,as well as the short term:,greater engagement from the prisoners,,longer-term engagement as well. 
 The last element is partnership.,There is, at the moment, a stale ndebate going on very often:,state's better, public sector's better,,private sector's better, social sector's better,,for a lot of these programs.,Actually, for creating social change,,we need to bring in the expertise,from all of those parties,in order to make this work.,And this creates a structure,through which they can combine. 
 So where does this leave us?,This leaves us with a way,that people can invest in social change.,We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,,who want the opportunity to invest in social change.,We've met champions all over the public sector,keen to make these kinds of differences.,With this kind of model,,we can help bring them together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may want to take a closer look.,There's more to this painting than meets the eye.,And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,,but I didn't paint it on canvas.,I painted it directly on top of the man. 
 What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,,and if I want to paint your portrait,,I'm painting it on you, physically on you.,That also means you're probably going to end up,with an earful of paint,,because I need to paint your ear on your ear.,Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes,,chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint,that mimics what's directly below it,,and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene,and make it look like a two-dimensional painting.,I can photograph it from any angle,,and it will still look 2D.,There's no Photoshop here.,This is just a photo,of one of my three-dimensional paintings. 
 You might be wondering how I came up with this idea,of turning people into paintings.,But originally, this had nothing to do,with either people or paint.,It was about shadows.,I was fascinated with the absence of light,,and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality,and pin it down before it changed.,I came up with the idea of painting shadows.,I loved that I could hide within this shadow,my own painted version,,and it would be almost invisible,until the light changed, and all of a sudden,my shadow would be brought to the light. 
 I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,,and I thought of my friend Bernie.,But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.,I also wanted to paint the highlights,and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.,I had a very specific vision of what this would look like,,and as I was painting him,,I made sure to follow that very closely.,But something kept on flickering before my eyes.,I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.,And then when I took that moment to take a step back,,magic.,I had turned my friend into a painting.,I couldn't have foreseen that,when I wanted to paint a shadow,,I would pull out this whole other dimension,,that I would collapse it,,that I would take a painting and make it my friend,and then bring him back to a painting. 
 I was a little conflicted though,,because I was so excited about what I'd found,,but I was just about to graduate from college,with a degree in political science,,and I'd always had this dream,of going to Washington, D.C.,,and sitting at a desk,and working in government.,(Laughter),Why did this have to get in the way of all that? 
 I made the tough decision,of going home after graduation,and not going up to Capitol Hill,,but going down to my parents' basement,and making it my job to learn how to paint.,I had no idea where to begin.,The last time I'd painted,,I was 16 years old at summer camp,,and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint,by copying the old masters,or stretching a canvas,and practicing over and over again on that surface,,because that's not what this project was about for me.,It was about space and light. 
 My early canvases ended up being,things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,,like fried food.,It's nearly impossible,to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.,(Laughter),Even harder was getting paint to stick,to the acid in a grapefruit.,It just would erase my brush strokes,like invisible ink.,I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone. 
 And if I wanted to paint on people,,well, I was a little bit embarrassed,to bring people down into my studio,and show them that I spent my days in a basement,putting paint on toast.,It just seemed like it made more sense,to practice by painting on myself.,One of my favorite models actually ended up being,a retired old man,who not only didn't mind sitting still,and getting the paint in his ears,,but he also didn't really have much embarrassment,about being taken out into very public places,for exhibition,,like the Metro. 
 I was having so much fun with this process.,I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,,and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.,I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,,and we had the idea of creating paintings,in a more unusual surface,,and that was milk.,We got a pool. We filled it with milk.,We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.,And the images were always,completely unexpected in the end,,because I could have a very specific image,about how it would turn out,,I could paint it to match that,,but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk,,everything would change.,It was in constant flux,,and we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it,,see where the milk would take us,and compensate to make it even better.,Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,,it would wash all the paint off of her arms,,and it might seem a little bit clumsy,,but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.,And one time, she got so much milk in her hair,that it just smeared all the paint off of her face.,All right, well, hide your face.,And we ended up with something far more elegant,than we could have imagined,,even though this is essentially the same solution,that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,,just hiding them in the pockets. 
 When we started out on the milk project,,and when I started out,,I couldn't have foreseen that I would go,from pursuing my dream in politics,and working at a desk,to tripping over a shadow,and then turning people into paintings,and painting on people in a pool of milk.,But then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable,that you can find the strange in the familiar,,as long as you're willing to look beyond,what's already been brought to light,,that you can see what's below the surface,,hiding in the shadows,,and recognize that there can be more there,than meets the eye. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When my father and I started a company,to 3D print human tissues and organs,,some people initially thought we were a little crazy.,But since then, much progress has been made,,both in our lab and other labs around the world.,And given this, we started getting questions like,,"If you can grow human body parts,,can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?" 
 When someone first suggested this to me,,quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,,but what I soon came to realize,was that this is not so crazy after all.,What's crazy is what we do today.,I'm convinced that in 30 years,,when we look back on today,and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals,to make our hamburgers and our handbags,,we'll see this as being wasteful,and indeed crazy.,Did you know that today we maintain,a global herd of 60 billion animals,to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?,And over the next few decades,,as the world's population expands to 10 billion,,this will need to nearly double,to 100 billion animals. 
 But maintaining this herd,takes a major toll on our planet.,Animals are not just raw materials.,They're living beings,,and already our livestock,is one of the largest users of land,,fresh water,,and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases,which drive climate change.,On top of this,,when you get so many animals so close together,,it creates a breeding ground for disease,and opportunities for harm and abuse.,Clearly, we cannot continue on this path,which puts the environment, public health,,and food security at risk. 
 There is another way, because essentially,,animal products are just collections of tissues,,and right now we breed and raise,highly complex animals,only to create products,that are made of relatively simple tissues.,What if, instead of starting with a complex,and sentient animal,,we started with what the tissues are made of,,the basic unit of life,,the cell? 
 This is biofabrication, where cells themselves,can be used to grow biological products,like tissues and organs.,Already in medicine,,biofabrication techniques have been used,to grow sophisticated body parts,,like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,,that have been successfully implanted into patients.,And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be,a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry. 
 And we should begin by reimagining leather.,I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.,It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.,Growing leather is also technically simpler,than growing other animal products like meat.,It mainly uses one cell type,,and it is largely two-dimensional.,It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.,Until biofabrication is better understood,,it is clear that, initially at least,,more people would be willing to wear novel materials,than would be willing to eat novel foods,,no matter how delicious.,In this sense, leather is a gateway material,,a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.,If we can succeed here,,it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat,closer on the horizon. 
 Now how do we do it?,To grow leather, we begin by taking cells,from an animal, through a simple biopsy.,The animal could be a cow,,lamb, or even something more exotic.,This process does no harm,,and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.,We then isolate the skin cells,and multiply them in a cell culture medium.,This takes millions of cells,and expands them into billions.,And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,,as they would naturally.,This collagen is the stuff between cells.,It's natural connective tissue.,It's the extracellular matrix,,but in leather, it's the main building block.,And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen,and we spread them out to form sheets,,and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,,like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,,which we then let mature.,And finally, we take this multilayered skin,and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,,we create leather.,And so I'm very excited to show you,,for the first time,,the first batch of our cultured leather,,fresh from the lab.,This is real, genuine leather,,without the animal sacrifice.,It can have all the characteristics of leather,because it is made of the same cells,,and better yet,,there is no hair to remove,,no scars or insect's bites,,and no waste.,This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,,a handbag or a car seat.,It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow,or an alligator. 
 And because we make this material,,we grow this leather from the ground up,,we can control its properties in very interesting ways.,This piece of leather,is a mere seven tissue layers thick,,and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.,And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.,You don't have that kind of fine control,with conventional leather.,And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,,like softness, breathability,,durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.,We can mimic nature,,but in some ways also improve upon it.,This type of leather can do what today's leather does,,but with imagination, probably much more. 
 What could the future of animal products look like?,It need not look like this,,which is actually the state of the art today.,Rather, it could be much more like this.,Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures,for thousands of years, beginning with products,like wine, beer and yogurt.,And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,,and today we prepare cultured food,in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.,A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.,It is where cell culture takes place.,Imagine that in this facility,,instead of brewing beer,,we were brewing leather,or meat.,Imagine touring this facility,,learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,,seeing the process from beginning to end,,and even trying some.,It's clean, open and educational,,and this is in contrast to the hidden,,guarded and remote factories,where leather and meat is produced today.,Perhaps biofabrication,is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.,It's environmentally responsible,,efficient and humane.,It allows us to be creative.,We can design new materials, new products,,and new facilities.,We need to move past just killing animals,as a resource,to something more civilized and evolved.,Perhaps we are ready for something,literally and figuratively more cultured. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Africa is booming.,Per capita incomes since the year 2000,have doubled,,and this boom is impacting on everyone.,Life expectancy has increased by one year,every three years for the last decade.,That means if an African child is born today,,rather than three days ago,,they will get an extra day of life,at the end of their lifespan.,It's that quick.,And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:,600,000 less people a year are getting HIV,in sub-Saharan Africa.,The battle against malaria is being won,,with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,,according to the latest World Bank data.,And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.,This shouldn't surprise us,,because actually, everybody grows.,If you go back to Imperial Rome,in the Year 1 A.D.,,there was admittedly about 1,800 years,where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.,But then the people that the Romans,would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,,were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,,and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,,and you saw that get quicker and quicker,,and it's been impacting everyone.,It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore,or the tundra of northern Finland.,Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when,the inevitable happens. 
 Among the reasons I think it's happening right now,is the quality of the leadership across Africa.,I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,,the greatest politician in the world was African,,but I'm meeting brilliant people,across the continent the entire time,,and they're doing the reforms,which have transformed the economic situation,for their countries. 
 And the West is engaging with that.,The West has given debt forgiveness programs,which have halved sub-Saharan debt,from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.,At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120,and we're all feeling slightly miserable,as a result.,Politics gets weaker when debt is high.,When public sector debt is low,,governments don't have to choose,between investing in education and health,and paying interest on that debt you owe.,And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.,The private sector as well.,Again, in the West, we have private sector debt,of 200 percent of GDP in Spain,,the U.K., and the U.S.,That's an awful lot of debt.,Africa, many African countries,,are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.,If there's any continent that can do what China has done --,China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --,if anyone can do what China has done,in the last 30 years,,it'll be Africa in the next 30. 
 So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.,Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.,Foreign direct investment,has poured into Africa in the last 15 years.,Back in the '70s,,no one touched the continent with a barge pole.,And this investment is actually Western-led.,We hear a lot about China,,and they do lend a lot of money,,but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years,has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.,Ten percent's come from India.,And they're investing in energy.,Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.,It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.,And they're investing in telecoms,,shopping malls.,And this very encouraging story, I think,,is partly demographic-led.,And it's not just about African demographics.,I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds,in various parts of the world,,and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.,Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn,setting up an iPhone factory, by chance.,You might choose China,,which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,,where there's 200 million young people,,and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.,Which means you're going to have new guys,knocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,",and, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job.",Now, that's completely changed now.,This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent,fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.,So where do you set up your new factory?,You look at South Asia, and people are.,They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,,and they're also looking at Africa.,And they're looking at Africa,because that yellow line is showing you,that the number of young Africans,is going to continue to get bigger,decade after decade after decade out to 2050. 
 Now, there's a problem with lots of young people,coming into any market,,particularly when they're young men.,A bit dangerous, sometimes.,I think one of the crucial factors,is how educated is that demographic?,If you look at the red line here,,what you're going to see is that in 1975,,just nine percent of kids,were in secondary school education,in sub-Saharan Africa.,Would you set up a factory,in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?,Nobody else did.,They chose instead Turkey and Mexico,to set up the textiles factories,,because their education levels,were 25 to 30 percent.,Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels,that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.,They will get the textiles jobs,that will take people out of rural poverty,and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth. 
 So what's Africa looking like today?,This is how I look at Africa.,It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.,Each little box is about a billion dollars,,and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention,to Nigeria sitting there in the middle.,South Africa is playing a role.,But when I'm thinking about the future,,I'm actually most interested,in Central, Western and Southern Africa.,If I look at Africa by population,,East Africa stands out,as so much potential. 
 And I'm showing you something else with these maps.,I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.,Fragile democracies is the beige color.,Strong democracies are the orange color.,And what you'll see here is that most Africans,are now living in democracies.,Why does that matter?,Because what people want,is what politicians try,,they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.,And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.,In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,,the battle between the two candidates,was over education.,One guy offered free secondary school education,to all, not just 30 percent.,The other guy had to say,,I'm going to build 50 new schools.,He won by a margin.,So democracy is encouraging governments,to invest in education.,Education is helping growth and investment,,and that's giving budget revenues,,which is giving governments more money,,which is helping growth through education.,It's a positive, virtuous circle. 
 But I get asked this question,,and this particular question makes me quite sad:,It's, "But what about corruption?,How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?",And what makes me sad about it,is that this graph here is showing you,that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.,When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.,And the countries on the right hand side,,you'll see the per capita GDP,,basically every country,with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,,has got a corruption score,of roughly, what's that, about three?,Three out of 10. That's not good.,Every poor country is corrupt.,Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.,How do you get from poverty and corruption,to wealth and less corruption?,You see the middle class grow.,And the way to do that is to invest,,not to say I'm not investing in that continent,because there's too much corruption. 
 Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.,I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --,not in Africa, actually.,But what I'm saying here is that,we can make a difference,and we can do that by investing. 
 Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.,Economists aren't great at forecasting.,Because the question really is, what happens next?,And if you go back to the year 2000,,what you'll find is The Economist,had a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,",and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth,in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --,and they said,,what's going to happen in the next 10 years?,They assumed two percent,,and that made it a pretty hopeless story,,because population growth was two and a half.,People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.,Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,,and what does that new cover show?,That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,,because the growth over the last 10 years,has been about five and a half percent. 
 I would like to see if you can all now become economists,,because if growth for the last 10 years,has been five and a half percent,,what do you think the IMF is forecasting,for the next five years of growth in Africa?,Very good. I think you're secretly saying,to your head, probably five and a half percent.,You're all economists, and I think,,like most economists, wrong.,No offense. 
 What I like to do is try and find the countries,that are doing exactly what Africa has already done,,and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing,to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.,India is one of those examples.,This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.,Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.,Actually, for the first 20 years,,the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.,It grew at two percent,when population growth was about two and a half.,If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened,in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.,And then something happened in 1980.,Boom! India began to explode.,It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,","democracies can't grow." Actually India could.,And if I lay sub-Saharan growth,on top of the Indian growth story,,it's remarkably similar.,Twenty years of not much growth,and a trend line which is actually telling you,that sub-Saharan African growth is,slightly better than India.,And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,,I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,,I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,,I can draw out some forecasts,for the next 30 to 40 years,which I think are better,than the ones where you're looking backwards.,And that tells me this:,that Africa is going to go,from a $2 trillion economy today,to a $29 trillion economy by 2050.,Now that's bigger than Europe and America,put together in today's money.,Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.,The population's going to double,from one billion to two billion,,so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold,in the next 35 years.,And when I present this in Africa --,Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.,"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?" 
 And you know what?,Actually, I think they've got a point.,Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,,yes from the positives in Asia and India,,but also the negatives?,Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.,Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here,this last week,,surely some of these can perhaps,help Africa grow even faster?,And I think here we can play a role.,Because technology does let you help.,You can go and download,some of the great African literature,from the Internet now.,No, not right now, just 30 seconds.,You can go and buy some of the great tunes.,My iPod's full of them.,Buy African products.,Go on holiday and see for yourself,the change that's happening.,Invest.,Perhaps hire people, give them the skills,that they can take back to Africa,,and their companies will grow an awful lot faster,than most of ours here in the West.,And then you and I can help make sure,that for Africa, the 21st century is their century. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)"Give me liberty or give me death." 
 When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,,said these words in 1775,,he could never have imagined,just how much they would come to resonate,with American generations to come.,At the time, these words were earmarked,and targeted against the British,,but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody,what many Westerners believe,,that freedom is the most cherished value,,and that the best systems of politics and economics,have freedom embedded in them.,Who could blame them?,Over the past hundred years, the combination,of liberal democracy and private capitalism,has helped to catapult the United States,and Western countries,to new levels of economic development.,In the United States over the past hundred years,,incomes have increased 30 times,,and hundreds of thousands of people,have been moved out of poverty.,Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation,has helped to spur industrialization,and also helped in the creation and the building,of things like household appliances,such as refrigerators and televisions,,motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.,It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths,of the private capitalism crisis,,President Obama said,,"The question before us is not whether the market,is a force for good or ill.,Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom,is unmatched.",Thus, there's understandably,a deep-seated presumption among Westerners,that the whole world will decide to adopt,private capitalism as the model of economic growth,,liberal democracy, and will continue,to prioritize political rights over economic rights. 
 However, to many who live in the emerging markets,,this is an illusion, and even though,the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,,which was signed in 1948,,was unanimously adopted,,what it did was to mask a schism,that has emerged between developednand developing countries,,and the ideological beliefs,between political and economic rights.,This schism has only grown wider.,Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,,where 90 percent of the world's population lives,,believe that the Western obsession,with political rights is beside the point,,and what is actually important,is delivering on food, shelter,,education and healthcare.,"Give me liberty or give me death",is all well and good if you can afford it,,but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,,you're far too busy trying to survive,and to provide for your family,than to spend your time going around,trying to proclaim and defend democracy. 
 Now, I know many people in this room,and around the world will think,,"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,",because private capitalism and liberal democracy,are held sacrosanct.,But I ask you today, what would you do,if you had to choose?,What if you had to choose,between a roof over your head,and the right to vote? 
 Over the last 10 years,,I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,,many of them in the emerging markets,,in Latin America, Asia,,and my own continent of Africa.,I've met with presidents, dissidents,,policymakers, lawyers, teachers,,doctors and the man on the street,,and through these conversations,,it's become clear to me,that many people in the emerging markets,believe that there's actually a split occurring,between what people believe ideologically,in terms of politics and economics in the West,and that which people believe in the rest of the world. 
 Now, don't get me wrong.,I'm not saying people in the emerging markets,don't understand democracy,,nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally,like to pick their presidents or their leaders.,Of course they would.,However, I am saying that on balance,,they worry more about,where their living standard improvements are going to come from,,and how it is their governments can deliver for them,,than whether or not the government,was elected by democracy. 
 The fact of the matter,is that this has become a very poignant question,because there is for the first time in a long time,a real challenge to the Western ideological systems,of politics and economics,,and this is a system that is embodied by China.,And rather than have private capitalism,nthey have state capitalism.,Instead of liberal democracy,nthey have de-prioritized the democratic system.,And they have also decided to prioritize,economic rights over political rights.,I put it to you today that it is this system,that is embodied by China,that is gathering momentum amongst people,in the emerging markets as the system to follow,,because they believe increasingly,that it is the system,that will promise the best and fastest improvements,in living standards in the shortest period of time.,If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments,explaining to you first,why economically they've come to this belief. 
 First of all, it's China's economic performance,over the past 30 years.,She's been able to produce record economic growth,and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,,specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty,by moving over 300 million people,out of indigence.,It's not just in economics,,but it's also in terms of living standards.,We see that in China, 28 percent of people,had secondary school access.,Today, it's closer to 82 percent.,So in its totality, economic improvement,has been quite significant. 
 Second, China has been able,to meaningfully improve its income inequality,without changing the political construct.,Today, the United States and China,are the two leading economies in the world.,They have vastly different political systems,and different economic systems,,one with private capitalism,,another one broadly with state capitalism.,However, these two countries,have the identical GINI Coefficient,,which is a measure of income equality.,Perhaps what is more disturbing,is that China's income equality,has been improving in recent times,,whereas that of the United States,has been declining. 
 Thirdly, people in the emerging markets,look at China's amazing and legendary,infrastructure rollout.,This is not just about China,building roads and ports and railways,in her own country --,she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers,of road network in China,and surpass that of the United States --,but even if you look to places like Africa,,China has been able to help tar the distance,of Cape Town to Cairo,,which is 9,000 miles,,or three times the distance of New York to California.,Now this is something that people can see and point to.,Perhaps it's no surprise,that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,,Africans in 10 countries said,they thought that the Chinese were doing,amazing things to improve their livelihoods,by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent. 
 Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions,to age-old social problems that the world faces.,If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,,you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics,continue to be a stumbling block,to the delivery of medicine and healthcare,in the rural areas.,However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,,the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,,using their companies,to help deliver on these healthcare solutions. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise,that around the world, people are pointingnat what China is doing and saying,,"I like that. I want that.,I want to be able to do what China's doing.,That is the system that seems to work.",I'm here to also tell you,that there are lots of shifts occurring,around what China is doing,in the democratic stance.,In particular, there is growing doubt,among people in the emerging markets,,when people now believe that democracy,is no longer to be viewed,as a prerequisite for economic growth.,In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,,not just China, have shown that actually,,it's economic growth that is a prerequisite,for democracy.,In a recent study, the evidence has shown,that income is the greatest determinant,of how long a democracy can last.,The study found that if your per capita income,is about 1,000 dollars a year,,your democracy will last about eight and a half years.,If your per capita income is between,2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,,then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.,And only if your per capita income,is above 6,000 dollars a year,will you have democracy come hell or high water. 
 What this is telling us,is that we need to first establish a middle class,that is able to hold the government accountable.,But perhaps it's also telling us,that we should be worried about going,around the world and shoehorning democracy,,because ultimately we run the risk,of ending up with illiberal democracies,,democracies that in some sense,could be worse than the authoritarian governments,that they seek to replace. 
 The evidence around illiberal democracies,is quite depressing.,Freedom House finds that although 50 percent,of the world's countries today are democratic,,70 percent of those countries are illiberal,in the sense that people don't have free speech,or freedom of movement.,But also, we're finding from Freedom House,in a study that they published last year,that freedom has been on the decline,every year for the past seven years. 
 What this says,is that for people like me,who care about liberal democracy,,is we've got to find a more sustainable way,of ensuring that we have a sustainable form,of democracy in a liberal way,,and that has its roots in economics.,But it also says that as China moves,toward being the largest economy in the world,,something that is expected to happen,by experts in 2016,,that this schism between the political,and economic ideologies of the West and the rest,is likely to widen. 
 What might that world look like?,Well, the world could look like,more state involvement and state capitalism;,greater protectionisms of nation-states;,but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,,ever-declining political rights,and individual rights. 
 The question that is left for us in general,is, what then should the West be doing?,And I suggest that they have two options.,The West can either compete or cooperate.,If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,,and in effect go around the world,and continue to try and push an agenda,of private capitalism and liberal democracy,,this is basically going against headwinds,,but it also would be a natural stance,for the West to take,because in many ways it is the antithesis,of the Chinese model,of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.,Now the fact of the matter is,,if the West decides to compete,,it will create a wider schism.,The other option is for the West to cooperate,,and by cooperating I mean,giving the emerging market countries the flexibility,to figure out in an organic way,what political and economic system,works best for them. 
 Now I'm sure some of you in the room,will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,,and this is a way, in other words,,for the West to take a back seat.,But I put it to you,that if the United States and European countries,want to remain globally influential,,they may have to consider cooperating,in the short term in order to compete,,and by that, they might have to focus,more aggressively on economic outcomes,to help create the middle class,and therefore be able to hold government accountable,and create the democracies that we really want. 
 The fact of the matter is that,instead of going around the world,and haranguing countries for engaging with China,,the West should be encouraging its own businesses,to trade and invest in these regions.,Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,,the West should be showing how it is,that their own system of politics and economics,is the superior one.,And instead of shoehorning democracy,around the world,,perhaps the West should take a leaf,out of its own history book,and remember that it takes a lot of patience,in order to develop the models,and the systems that you have today.,Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer,reminds us that it took the United States,nearly 170 years,from the time that the Constitution was written,for there to be equal rights in the United States.,Some people would argue that today,there is still no equal rights.,In fact, there are groups who would argue,that they still do not have equal rights under the law. 
 At its very best,,the Western model speaks for itself.,It's the model that put food on the table.,It's the refrigerators.,It put a man on the moon.,But the fact of the matter is,,although people back in the day,used to point at the Western countries and say,,"I want that, I like that,",there's now a new person in town,in the form of a country, China.,Today, generations are looking at China,and saying, "China can produce infrastructure,,China can produce economic growth,,and we like that." 
 Because ultimately, the question before us,,and the question before,seven billion people on the planet,is, how can we create prosperity?,People who care and will pivot towards the model,of politics and economics,in a very rational way,,to those models that will ensure,that they can have better living standards,in the shortest period of time. 
 As you leave here today,,I would like to leave you,with a very personal message,,which is what it is that I believe,we should be doing as individuals,,and this is really about being open-minded,,open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams,of creating prosperity for people around the world,,creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty,for hundreds of millions of people,,has to be based in being open-minded,,because these systems have good things,and they have bad things. 
 Just to illustrate,,I went into my annals of myself.,That's a picture of me. 
 Awww. (Laughter) 
 I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.,At the time of my birth,,blacks were not issued birth certificates,,and that law only changed in 1973.,This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.,I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,,I've gone from not being recognized as a human being,to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today,to talk to you about my views.,In this vein, we can increase economic growth.,We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.,But also, it's going to require,that we look at our assumptions,,assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with,around democracy, around private capitalism,,around what creates economic growth,and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.,We might have to tear those books up,and start to look at other options,and be open-minded to seek the truth.,Ultimately, it's about transforming the world,and making it a better place. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Clouds.,Have you ever noticed how muchnpeople moan about them?,They get a bad rap.,If you think about it,nthe English language,has written into it negativenassociations towards the clouds.,Someone who's down or depressed,,they're under a cloud.,And when there's bad news in store,,there's a cloud on the horizon.,I saw an article the other day.,It was about problemsnwith computer processing,over the Internet.,"A cloud over the cloud,"nwas the headline.,It seems like they're everyone's default,doom-and-gloom metaphor.,But I think they're beautiful, don't you?,It's just that their beauty is missed,because they're so omnipresent,,so, I don't know, commonplace,,that people don't notice them.,They don't notice the beauty,nbut they don't even notice the clouds,unless they get in the way of the sun.,And so people think of clouds as,things that get in the way.,They think of them as the annoying,nfrustrating obstructions,,and then they rush off and donsome blue-sky thinking.,(Laughter),But most people, whennyou stop to ask them,,will admit to harboring a strangensort of fondness for clouds.,It's like a nostalgic fondness,,and they make them think of their youth.,Who here can't remember thinking, well,,looking and finding shapes in the clouds,when they were kids?,You know, when you werenmasters of daydreaming?,Aristophanes, the ancientnGreek playwright,,he described the cloudsnas the patron godesses,of idle fellows,two and a half thousand years ago,,and you can see what he means.,It's just that these days,nus adults seem reluctant,to allow ourselves the indulgence,of just allowing our imaginations,to drift along in the breeze,nand I think that's a pity.,I think we should perhapsndo a bit more of it.,I think we should be a bitnmore willing, perhaps,,to look at the beautiful sightnof the sunlight bursting out,from behind the cloudsnand go, "Wait a minute,,that's two cats dancing the salsa!",(Laughter) (Applause),Or seeing the big, white,npuffy one up there,over the shopping center looks like,the Abominable Snowmanngoing to rob a bank.,(Laughter),They're like nature's versionnof those inkblot images,,you know, that shrinks usednto show their patients,in the '60s,,and I think if you considernthe shapes you see in the clouds,,you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.,Let's say you're in love. All right?,And you look up and what do you see?,Right? Or maybe the opposite.,You've just been dumped by your partner,,and everywhere you look,nit's kissing couples.,(Laughter),Perhaps you're having a momentnof existential angst.,You know, you're thinkingnabout your own mortality.,And there, on the horizon,nit's the Grim Reaper.,(Laughter),Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.,(Laughter),What would that mean?,What would that mean? I have no idea.,But one thing I do know is this:,The bad press that cloudsnget is totally unfair.,I think we should stand up for them,,which is why, a few years ago,,I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.,Tens of thousands of members now,in almost 100 countries around the world.,And all these photographsnthat I'm showing,,they were sent in by members.,And the society existsnto remind people of this:,Clouds are not something to moan about.,Far from it. They are, in fact,,the most diverse, evocative,npoetic aspect of nature.,I think, if you livenwith your head in the clouds,every now and then, it helps younkeep your feet on the ground.,And I want to show younwhy, with the help of,some of my favorite types of clouds.,Let's start with this one.nIt's the cirrus cloud,,named after the Latin for a lock of hair.,It's composed entirely of ice crystals,cascading from the uppernreaches of the troposphere,,and as these ice crystals fall,,they pass through differentnlayers with different winds,and they speed up and slow down,,giving the cloud thesenbrush-stroked appearances,,these brush-stroke formsnknown as fall streaks.,And these winds up therencan be very, very fierce.,They can be 200 milesnan hour, 300 miles an hour.,These clouds are bombing along,,but from all the way down here,,they appear to be movingngracefully, slowly,,like most clouds.,And so to tune into the cloudsnis to slow down,,to calm down.,It's like a bit of everyday meditation.,Those are common clouds.,What about rarer ones,nlike the lenticularis,,the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?,These clouds formnin the region of mountains.,When the wind passes, risesnto pass over the mountain,,it can take on a wave-likenpath in the lee of the peak,,with these clouds hovering at the crest,of these invisible standing waves of air,,these flying saucer-like forms,,and some of the earlynblack-and-white UFO photos,are in fact lenticularis clouds.nIt's true.,A little rarer are the fallstreak holes.nAll right?,This is when a layer is madenup of very, very cold,water droplets, and in one regionnthey start to freeze,,and this freezing sets off a chainnreaction which spreads outwards,with the ice crystals cascadingnand falling down below,,giving the appearancenof jellyfish tendrils down below.,Rarer still, the Kelvin–Helmholtz cloud.,Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.,This looks like a seriesnof breaking waves,,and it's caused by shearingnwinds -- the wind,above the cloud layernand below the cloud layer,differ significantly,nand in the middle, in between,,you get this undulating of the air,,and if the difference in thosenspeeds is just right,,the tops of the undulations curl over,in these beautiful breakingnwave-like vortices.,All right. Those are rarernclouds than the cirrus,,but they're not that rare.,If you look up, and younpay attention to the sky,,you'll see them sooner or later,,maybe not quite as dramaticnas these, but you'll see them.,And you'll see them around where you live.,Clouds are the most egalitarian,of nature's displays,nbecause we all have a good,,fantastic view of the sky.,And these clouds, these rarer clouds,,remind us that the exotic cannbe found in the everyday.,Nothing is more nourishing,nmore stimulating,to an active, inquiringnmind than being surprised,,being amazed. It's why we'renall here at TED, right?,But you don't need to rush off,away from the familiar, across the world,to be surprised.,You just need to step outside,,pay attention to what's soncommonplace, so everyday,,so mundane that everybody else misses it.,One cloud that peoplenrarely miss is this one:,the cumulonimbus storm cloud.,It's what's produces thundernand lightning and hail.,These clouds spreadnout at the top in this enormous,anvil fashion stretching 10nmiles up into the atmosphere.,They are an expressionnof the majestic architecture,of our atmosphere.,But from down below,nthey are the embodiment,of the powerful, elemental force and power,that drives our atmosphere.,To be there is to be connectednin the driving rain,and the hail, to feelnconnected to our atmosphere.,It's to be reminded that we are creatures,that inhabit this ocean of air.,We don't live beneath the sky.nWe live within it.,And that connection, that visceralnconnection to our atmosphere,feels to me like an antidote.,It's an antidote to the growingntendency we have,to feel that we can reallynever experience life,by watching it on a computernscreen, you know,,when we're in a wi-fi zone.,But the one cloud that best expresses,why cloudspotting is morenvaluable today than ever,is this one, the cumulus cloud.,Right? It forms on a sunny day.,If you close your eyesnand think of a cloud,,it's probably one of thesenthat comes to mind.,All those cloud shapes at the beginning,,those were cumulus clouds.,The sharp, crisp outlinesnof this formation,make it the bestnone for finding shapes in.,And it reminds us,of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,,what an aimless activity it is.,You're not going to change the world,by lying on your back and gazingnup at the sky, are you?,It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,,which is precisely why it's so important.,The digital worldnconspires to make us feel,eternally busy, perpetually busy.,You know, when you're not dealing with,the traditional pressuresnof earning a living,and putting food on the table,nraising a family,,writing thank you letters,,you have to now contend with,answering a mountain of unanswered emails,,updating a Facebook page,,feeding your Twitter feed.,And cloudspottingnlegitimizes doing nothing.,(Laughter),And sometimes we need —,(Applause),Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.,We need to be reminded by these,patron goddesses of idle fellows,that slowing down,and being in the present,nnot thinking about,what you've got to donand what you should have done,,but just being here,nletting your imagination,lift from the everyday concerns down here,and just being in the present,nit's good for you,,and it's good for the way you feel.,It's good for your ideas.nIt's good for your creativity.,It's good for your soul.,So keep looking up,,marvel at the ephemeral beauty,,and always remember to live lifenwith your head in the clouds.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I am a neuroscientist,with a mixed background in physics and medicine.,My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,focuses on spinal cord injury,,which affects more than 50,000 people,around the world every year,,with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,,whose life literally shatters,in a matter of a handful of seconds. 
 And for me, the Man of Steel,,Christopher Reeve,,has best raised the awareness,on the distress of spinal cord injured people.,And this is how I started my own personal journey,in this field of research,,working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. 
 I still remember this decisive moment.,It was just at the end of a regular day of work,with the foundation.,Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts,,"You have to be more pragmatic.,When leaving your laboratory tomorrow,,I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center,to watch injured people,fighting to take a step,,struggling to maintain their trunk.,And when you go home,,think of what you are going to change in your research,on the following day to make their lives better." 
 These words, they stuck with me.,This was more than 10 years ago,,but ever since, my laboratory has followed,the pragmatic approach to recovery,after spinal cord injury.,And my first step in this direction,was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury,that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury,while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.,And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections,on opposite sides of the body.,They completely interrupt the communication,between the brain and the spinal cord,,thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis,of the leg.,But, as observed, after most injuries in humans,,there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue,through which recovery can occur.,But how to make it happen? 
 Well, the classical approach,consists of applying intervention,that would promote the growth of the severed fiber,to the original target.,And while this certainly remained the key for a cure,,this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.,To reach clinical fruition rapidly,,it was obvious:,I had to think about the problem differently. 
 It turned out that more than 100 years of research,on spinal cord physiology,,starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,,had shown that,the spinal cord, below most injuries,,contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks,to coordinate locomotion,,but because input from the brain is interrupted,,they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.,My idea: We awaken this network. 
 And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,,after completing my Ph.D. in France,,where independent thinking,is not necessarily promoted.,(Laughter),I was afraid to talk to my new boss,,but decided to muster up my courage.,I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,,Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea. 
 He listened to me carefully,,and responded with a grin.,"Why don't you try?" 
 And I promise to you,,this was such an important moment in my career,,when I realized that the great leader,believed in young people and new ideas. 
 And this was the idea:,I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor,to explain to you this complicated concept.,Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.,The engine is the spinal cord.,The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.,How could we re-engage the engine?,First, we have to provide the fuel;,second, press the accelerator pedal;,third, steer the car.,It turned out that there are known neural pathways,coming from the brain that play this very function,during locomotion.,My idea: Replace this missing input,to provide the spinal cord,with the kind of intervention,that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk. 
 For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,,first to replace the missing fuel,with pharmacological agents,that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,,and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal,with electrical stimulation.,So here imagine an electrode,implanted on the back of the spinal cord,to deliver painless stimulation.,It took many years, but eventually we developed,an electrochemical neuroprosthesis,that transformed the neural network,in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.,Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.,As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,,the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,,but without the brain.,Here what I call "the spinal brain",cognitively processes sensory information,arising from the moving leg,and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle,in order to stand, to walk, to run,,and even here, while sprinting,,instantly stand,if the treadmill stops moving. 
 This was amazing.,I was completely fascinated by this locomotion,without the brain,,but at the same time so frustrated.,This locomotion was completely involuntary.,The animal had virtually no control over the legs.,Clearly, the steering system was missing.,And it then became obvious from me,that we had to move away,from the classical rehabilitation paradigm,,stepping on a treadmill,,and develop conditions that would encourage,the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg. 
 With this in mind, we developed a completely new,robotic system to support the rat,in any direction of space.,Imagine, this is really cool.,So imagine the little 200-gram rat,attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,,but the rat does not feel the robot.,The robot is transparent,,just like you would hold a young child,during the first insecure steps. 
 Let me summarize: The rat received,a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.,The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled,a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.,The robot provided the safe environment,to allow the rat to attempt anything,to engage the paralyzed legs.,And for motivation, we used what I think,is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:,fine Swiss chocolate. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, the first results were very, very,,very disappointing.,Here is my best physical therapist,completely failing to encourage the rat,to take a single step,,whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,,walked beautifully on the treadmill.,We were so frustrated. 
 But you know, one of the most essential qualities,of a scientist is perseverance.,We insisted. We refined our paradigm,,and after several months of training,,the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,,and whenever she decided,,initiated full weight-bearing locomotion,to sprint towards the rewards.,This is the first recovery ever observed,of voluntary leg movement,after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord,leading to complete and permanent paralysis. 
 In fact -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 In fact, not only could the rat initiate,and sustain locomotion on the ground,,they could even adjust leg movement,,for example, to resist gravity,in order to climb a staircase.,I can promise you this was,such an emotional moment in my laboratory.,It took us 10 years of hard work,to reach this goal. 
 But the remaining question was, how?,I mean, how is it possible?,And here, what we found,was completely unexpected.,This novel training paradigm,encouraged the brain to create new connections,,some relay circuits,that relay information from the brain,past the injury and restore cortical control,over the locomotor networks below the injury.,And here, you can see one such example,,where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.,This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,,and what this constellation,of synaptic contacts means,is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center,with only one relay neuron.,But the remodeling was not restricted,to the lesion area.,It occurred throughout the central nervous system,,including in the brain stem,,where we observed up to 300-percent increase,in the density of fibers coming from the brain.,We did not aim to repair the spinal cord,,yet we were able to promote,one of the more extensive remodeling,of axonal projections ever observed,in the central nervous system of adult mammal,after an injury. 
 And there is a very important message,hidden behind this discovery.,They are the result of a young team,of very talented people:,physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,,engineers of all kinds,,who have achieved together,what would have been impossible by single individuals.,This is truly a trans-disciplinary team.,They are working so close to each other,that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.,We are creating the next generation,of M.D.'s and engineers,capable of translating discoveries all the way,from bench to bedside.,And me?,I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony. 
 Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,,will this help injured people?,Me too, every day.,The truth is that we don't know enough yet.,This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,,but I begin to believe that this may lead,to an intervention to improve recovery,and people's quality of life. 
 I would like you all,to take a moment and dream with me.,Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.,After a few weeks of recovery,,we will implant a programmable pump,to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail,directly to the spinal cord.,At the same time, we will implant an electrode array,,a sort of second skin,covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,,and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator,that delivers stimulations that are tailored,to the person's needs.,This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis,that will enable locomotion,during training with a newly designed supporting system.,And my hope is that after several months of training,,there may be enough remodeling of residual connection,to allow locomotion without the robot,,maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.,My hope here is to be able to create,the personalized condition,to boost the plasticity of the brain,and the spinal cord.,And this is a radically new concept,that may apply to other neurological disorders,,what I termed "personalized neuroprosthetics,",where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,,I implanted throughout the nervous system,,in the brain, in the spinal cord,,even in peripheral nerves,,based on patient-specific impairments.,But not to replace the lost function, no --,to help the brain help itself. 
 And I hope this enticed your imagination,,because I can promise to you,this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,,but when.,And remember, we are only as great,as our imagination, as big as our dream. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was born and raised in North Korea.,Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,,I was always loved and cared for first,,because I was the only son,and the youngest of two in the family. 
 But then the great famine began in 1994.,I was four years old.,My sister and I would go searching for firewood,starting at 5 in the morning,and come back after midnight.,I would wander the streets searching for food,,and I remember seeing a small child,tied to a mother's back eating chips,,and wanting to steal them from him. 
 Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.,For a hungry child, politics and freedom,are not even thought of.,On my ninth birthday, my parents,couldn't give me any food to eat.,But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness,in their hearts. 
 Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,,and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,,my father became one of them.,I saw my father wither away and die.,In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,,and then my sister told me,that she was going to China to earn money,,but that she would return with money and food soon.,Since we had never been separated,,and I thought we would be together forever,,I didn't even give her a hug when she left.,It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.,But again, I didn't know,it was going to be a long goodbye.,I have not seen my mom or my sister since then. 
 Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.,My daily life became very hard,,but very simple.,My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.,But that is no way to survive.,I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.,So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.,Sometimes, I found small jobs,in exchange for food.,Once, I even spent two months in the winter,working in a coal mine,,33 meters underground without any protection,for up to 16 hours a day.,I was not uncommon.,Many other orphans survived this way, or worse. 
 When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold,or hunger pains,,I hoped that, the next morning,,my sister would come back to wake me up,with my favorite food.,That hope kept me alive.,I don't mean big, grand hope.,I mean the kind of hope that made me believe,that the next trash can had bread,,even though it usually didn't.,But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,,and then I would die.,Hope kept me alive.,Every day, I told myself,,no matter how hard things got,,still I must live. 
 After three years of waiting for my sister's return,,I decided to go to China to look for her myself.,I realized,I couldn't survive much longer this way.,I knew the journey would be risky,,but I would be risking my life either way.,I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,,or at least I could try for a better life,by escaping to China. 
 I had learned that many people tried to cross,the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.,North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people,trying to cross the border without permission.,Chinese soldiers will catch,and send back North Koreans,,where they face severe punishment.,I decided to cross during the day,,first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,,second because I knew I was already taking a risk,,and since not many people tried to cross during the day,,I thought I might be able to cross,without being seen by anyone. 
 I made it to China on February 15, 2006.,I was 16 years old.,I thought things in China would be easier,,since there was more food.,I thought more people would help me.,But it was harder than living in North Korea,,because I was not free.,I was always worried about being caught,and sent back. 
 By a miracle, some months later,,I met someone who was running,an underground shelter for North Koreans,,and was allowed to live there,and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.,Later that year, an activist helped me escape China,and go to the United States as a refugee. 
 I went to America without knowing a word of English,,yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.,Even in North Korea, I was an F student.,(Laughter),And I barely finished elementary school.,And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.,Textbooks and the library were not my playground.,My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,,but it didn't work.,At one point, my father gave up on me.,He said, "You're not my son anymore.",I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.,But nevertheless, my level of motivation,still didn't change before he died.,So in America, it was kind of ridiculous,that they said I should go to high school.,I didn't even go to middle school.,I decided to go, just because they told me to,,without trying much. 
 But one day, I came home and my foster mother,had made chicken wings for dinner.,And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,,but I realized there were not enough for everyone,,so I decided against it.,When I looked down at my plate,,I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.,I was so happy.,I looked at him sitting next to me.,He just looked back at me very warmly,,but said no words.,Suddenly I remembered my biological father.,My foster father's small act of love,reminded me of my father,,who would love to share his food with me,when he was hungry, even if he was starving.,I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,,yet my father died of starvation.,My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,,and that night I also thought of what else I could do,to honor him.,And my answer was to promise to myself,that I would study hard and get the best education,in America to honor his sacrifice. 
 I took school seriously,,and for the first time ever in my life,,I received an academic award for excellence,,and made dean's list from the first semester in high school. 
 (Applause) 
 That chicken wing changed my life.,(Laughter) 
 Hope is personal. Hope is something,that no one can give to you.,You have to choose to believe in hope.,You have to make it yourself.,In North Korea, I made it myself.,Hope brought me to America.,But in America, I didn't know what to do,,because I had this overwhelming freedom.,My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,,and he motivated me and gave me a purpose,to live in America. 
 I did not come here by myself.,I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.,Many people helped me along the way to get here.,North Koreans are fighting hard to survive.,They have to force themselves to survive,,have hope to survive,,but they cannot make it without help. 
 This is my message to you.,Have hope for yourself,,but also help each other.,Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.,My foster father didn't intend to change my life.,In the same way, you may also change someone's life,with even the smallest act of love.,A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,,and having the hope will bring you bread,to keep you alive.,But I confidently believe that,your act of love and caring,can also save another Joseph's life,and change thousands of other Josephs,who are still having hope to survive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing,that very personal and special story with us.,I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,,it was almost exactly a decade,,and in the off chance that she may be able to see this,,we wanted to give you an opportunity,to send her a message. 
 Joseph Kim: In Korean? 
 AH: You can do English, then Korean as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean,because I don't think I can make it,without tearing up. 
 Nuna, it has been already 10 years,that I haven’t seen you.,I just wanted to say,that I miss you, and I love you,,and please come back to me and stay alive.,And I -- oh, gosh.,I still haven't given up my hope to see you.,I will live my life happily,and study hard,until I see you,,and I promise I will not cry again.,(Laughter),Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,,and if you can't find me,,I will also look for you,,and I hope to see you one day.,And can I also make a small message to my mom? 
 AH: Sure, please. 
 JK: I haven't spent much time with you,,but I know that you still love me,,and you probably still pray for me,and think about me.,I just wanted to say thank you,for letting me be in this world.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was preparing for this talk,,I went to search for a couple of quotes,that I can share with you.,Good news: I found three,that I particularly liked,,the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,,"When making your choice in life,,do not forget to live,",the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that,"happiness is a choice that requires effort,",and the third is one by Groucho Marx,who said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong,to any club that would have me as a member." 
 Now, bad news:,I didn't know which one of these quotes,to choose and share with you.,The sweet anxiety of choice. 
 In today's times of post-industrial capitalism,,choice, together with individual freedom,and the idea of self-making,,has been elevated to an ideal.,Now, together with this, we also have a belief,in endless progress.,But the underside of this ideology,has been an increase of anxiety,,feelings of guilt,,feelings of being inadequate,,feeling that we are failing in our choices.,Sadly, this ideology of individual choice,has prevented us from thinking about social changes.,It appears that this ideology was actually,very efficient in pacifying us,as political and social thinkers.,Instead of making social critiques,,we are more and more engaging in self-critique,,sometimes to the point of self-destruction. 
 Now, how come that ideology of choice,is still so powerful,,even among people who have,not many things to choose among?,How come that even people who are poor,very much still identify with the idea of choice,,the kind of rational idea of choice,which we embrace? 
 Now, the ideology of choice is very successful,in opening for us a space to think,about some imagined future.,Let me give you an example.,My friend Manya,,when she was a student at university in California,,was earning money,by working for a car dealer.,Now, Manya, when she encountered,the typical customer, would debate with him,about his lifestyle,,how much he wants to spend,,how many children he has,,what does he need the car for?,They would usually come to a good conclusion,what would be a perfect car.,Now, before Manya's customer would go home,and think things through,,she would say to him,,"The car that you are buying now is perfect,,but in a few year's time,,when your kids will be already out of the house,,when you will have a little bit more money,,that other car will be ideal.,But what you are buying now is great.",Now, the majority of Manya's customers,who came back the next day,bought that other car,,the car they did not need,,the car that cost far too much money.,Now, Manya became so successful in selling cars,that soon she moved on to selling airplanes.,(Laughter),And knowing so much aboutnthe psychology of people,prepared her well for her current job,,which is that of a psychoanalyst. 
 Now, why were Manya's customers so irrational?,Manya's success was that she was able,to open in their heads an image,of an idealized future,,an image of themselves,when they are already more successful, freer,,and for them, choosing that other car,was as if they are coming closer to this ideal,in which it was as if Manya already saw them. 
 Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.,Choices are influenced by our unconscious,,by our community.,We're often choosing,by guessing, what would other people,think about our choice?,Also we are choosing,by looking at what others are choosing.,We're also guessing what isnsocially acceptable choice.,Now, because of this, we actually,even after we have already chosen,,like bought a car,,endlessly read reviews about cars,,as if we still want to convince ourselves,that we made the right choice. 
 Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.,They are linked to risks, losses.,They are highly unpredictable.,Now, because of this,,people have now more and more problems,that they are not choosing anything.,Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,,and I met a young, beautiful woman,who immediately started tellingnme about her anxiety over choice.,She said to me, "I needed one month,to decide which dress to wear.",Then she said, "For weeks I was researching,which hotel to stay for this one night.,And now, I need to choose a sperm donor.",(Laughter),I looked at this woman in shock.,"Sperm donor? What's the rush?",She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,,and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life." 
 Now choice, because it's linked to risk,,is anxiety-provoking,,and it was already the famous,Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard,who pointed out that anxiety,is linked to the possibility of possibility.,Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.,We have endless market analysis,,projections of the future earnings.,Even with market, which is about chance,,randomness, we think we can predict rationally,where it's going. 
 Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.,Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourt,at the University of Chicago organized an event,,a conference on the idea of chance.,He and I were together on the panel,,and just before delivering our papers —,we didn't know each other's papers —,we decided to take chance seriously.,So we informed our audience,that what they will just now hear,will be a random paper,,a mixture of the two papers,which we didn't know what each was writing.,Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.,Bernard read his first paragraph,,I read my first paragraph,,Bernard read his second paragraph,,I read my second paragraph,,in this way towards the end of our papers.,Now, you will be surprised,that a majority of our audience,did not think that what they'd just listened to,was a completely random paper.,They couldn't believe that,speaking from the position of authority,like two professors we were,,we would take chance seriously.,They thought we prepared the papers together,and were just joking that it's random. 
 Now, we live in times with a lot of information,,big data,,a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.,We decoded our genome.,We know about our brains more than before.,But surprisingly, people are more and more,turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.,Ignorance and denial are on the rise.,Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,,we think that we will just wake up again,and everything will be the same as before,,and no political or social changes are needed.,In regard to ecological crisis,,we think nothing needs to be done just now,,or others need to act before us.,Or even when ecological crisis already happens,,like a catastrophe in Fukushima,,often we have people living in the same environment,with the same amount of information,,and half of them will be anxious about radiation,and half of them will ignore it. 
 Now, psychoanalysts know very well,that people surprisingly don't have,passion for knowledge,but passion for ignorance.,Now, what does that mean?,Let's say when we are facing,a life-threatening illness,,a lot of people don't want to know that.,They'd rather prefer denying the illness,,which is why it's not so wise to inform them,if they don't ask.,Surprisingly, research shows that sometimes,people who deny their illness,live longer than those who are rationally choosing,the best treatment. 
 Now, this ignorance, however,,is not very helpful on the level of the social.,When we are ignorant about where we are heading,,a lot of social damage can be caused. 
 Now, on top of facing ignorance,,we are also facing today,some kind of an obviousness.,Now, it was French philosopher,Louis Althusser who pointed out,that ideology functions in such a way,that it creates a veil of obviousness.,Before we do any social critique,,it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness,and to think through a little bit differently.,If we go back to this ideology,of individual, rational choice,we often embrace,,it's necessary precisely here,to lift this obviousness,and to think a little bit differently. 
 Now for me, a question often is,why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man,on which capitalism relied from its beginning?,Why do we think that we are really such masters,of our lives that we can rationally,make the best ideal choices,,that we don't accept losses and risks?,And for me, it's very shocking tonsee sometimes very poor people,,for example, not supporting the idea,of the rich being taxed more.,Quite often here they still identify,with a certain kind of a lottery mentality.,Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it,in the future, but maybe they think,,my son might become the next Bill Gates.,And who would want to tax one's son?,Or, a question for me is also,,why would people who have no health insurance,not embrace universal healthcare?,Sometimes they don't embrace it,,again identifying with the idea of choice,,but they have nothing to choose from. 
 Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said,that there is nothing like a society.,Society doesn't exist, it is only individuals,and their families.,Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,,which is why people who are poor might feel,ashamed for their poverty.,We might endlessly feel guilty that we are,not making the right choices,,and that's why we didn't succeed.,We are anxious that we are not good enough.,That's why we work very hard,,long hours at the workplace,and equally long hours on remaking ourselves.,Now, when we are anxious over choices,,sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.,We identify with the guru,who tells us what to do,,self-help therapist,,or we embrace a totalitarian leader,who appears to have no doubts about choices,,who sort of knows. 
 Now, often people ask me,,"What did you learn by studying choice?",And there is an important message that I did learn.,When thinking about choices,,I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.,First, I realized a lot of choice I make,is not rational.,It's linked to my unconscious,,my guesses of what others are choosing,,or what is a socially embraced choice.,I also embrace the idea,that we should go beyond,thinking about individual choices,,that it's very important to rethink social choices,,since this ideology of individualnchoice has pacified us.,It really prevented us to think about social change.,We spend so much timenchoosing things for ourselves,and barely reflect on,communal choices we can make. 
 Now, we should not forget that choice,is always linked to change.,We can make individual changes,,but we can make social changes.,We can choose to have more wolves.,We can choose to change our environment,to have more bees.,We can choose to have different rating agencies.,We can choose to control corporations,instead of allowing corporations to control us.,We have a possibility to make changes. 
 Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,,who said that when we make choice in life,,we shouldn't forget to live.,Finally, you can see,I did have a choice,to choose one of the three quotes,with which I wanted to start my lecture.,I did have a choice,,such as nations, as people,,we have choices too to rethink,in what kind of society we want to live in the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What I'd like to do today is talknabout one of my favorite subjects,,and that is the neuroscience of sleep. 
 Now, there is a sound -- 
 (Alarm clock) 
 Ah, it worked!,A sound that is desperatelynfamiliar to most of us,,and of course it's the soundnof the alarm clock.,And what that truly ghastly,nawful sound does,is stop the single most importantnbehavioral experience,that we have, and that's sleep.,If you're an average sort of person,,36 percent of your lifenwill be spent asleep,,which means that if you live to 90,,then 32 years will havenbeen spent entirely asleep. 
 Now what that 32 years is telling usnis that sleep at some level is important.,And yet, for most of us,nwe don't give sleep a second thought.,We throw it away.,We really just don't think about sleep.,And so what I'd like to do todaynis change your views,,change your ideasnand your thoughts about sleep.,And the journeynthat I want to take you on,,we need to start by going back in time. 
 "Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.",Any ideas who said that?,Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.,Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.,"O sleep, O gentle sleep,nnature's soft nurse,,how have I frighted thee?",Shakespeare again, from --nI won't say it --,the Scottish play. 
 (Laughter) 
 From the same time:,"Sleep is the golden chainnthat ties health and our bodies together.",Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,nanother Elizabethan dramatist. 
 But if we jump forward 400 years,,the tone about sleep changes somewhat.,This is from Thomas Edison,nfrom the beginning of the 20th century:,"Sleep is a criminal waste of timenand a heritage from our cave days.",Bang! 
 (Laughter) 
 And if we also jump into the 1980s,nsome of you may remember,that Margaret Thatchernwas reported to have said,,"Sleep is for wimps.",And of course the infamous --nwhat was his name? --,the infamous Gordon Gekkonfrom "Wall Street" said,,"Money never sleeps." 
 What do we do in the 20thncentury about sleep?,Well, of course, we usenThomas Edison's light bulb,to invade the night,nand we occupied the dark,,and in the process of this occupation,,we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.,We've treated it as an enemy.,At most now, I suppose,nwe tolerate the need for sleep,,and at worst perhapsnmany of us think of sleep,as an illness that needsnsome sort of a cure.,And our ignorance about sleepnis really quite profound.,Why is it? Why do we abandonnsleep in our thoughts?,Well, it's because you don't do anythingnmuch while you're asleep, it seems.,You don't eat. You don't drink.,And you don't have sex.,Well, most of us anyway.,And so, therefore it's --,Sorry.,It's a complete waste of time, right?,Wrong.,Actually, sleep is an incrediblynimportant part of our biology,,and neuroscientistsnare beginning to explain,why it's so very important.,So let's move to the brain. 
 Now, here we have a brain.,This is donated by a social scientist,,and they said they didn't know whatnit was or indeed, how to use it, so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry.,So I borrowed it.,I don't think they noticed. OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 The point I'm trying to makenis that when you're asleep,,this thing doesn't shut down.,In fact, some areas of the brainnare actually more active,during the sleep statenthan during the wake state.,The other thing that's reallynimportant about sleep,is that it doesn't arise from a singlenstructure within the brain,,but is to some extent a network property.,If we flip the brain on its back --,I love this little bitnof spinal cord here --,this bit here is the hypothalamus,,and right under there is a whole raftnof interesting structures,,not least the biological clock.,The biological clock tells usnwhen it's good to be up,,when it's good to be asleep,,and what that structure does is interact,with a whole raft of other areasnwithin the hypothalamus,,the lateral hypothalamus,nthe ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.,All of those combine,,and they send projectionsndown to the brain stem here.,The brain stem then projects forward,and bathes the cortex,nthis wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,,with neurotransmitters that keep us awake,and essentially provide usnwith our consciousness.,So sleep arises from a whole raft,of different interactionsnwithin the brain,,and essentially,nsleep is turned on and off,as a result of a rangenof interactions in here. 
 OK. So where have we got to?,We've said that sleep is complicated,and it takes 32 years of our life.,But what I haven't explainednis what sleep is about.,So why do we sleep?,And it won't surprisenany of you that, of course,,as scientists, we don't have a consensus.,There are dozens of different ideasnabout why we sleep,,and I'm going to outline three of those. 
 The first is sort of the restoration idea,,and it's somewhat intuitive.,Essentially, all the stuffnwe've burned up during the day,,we restore, we replace,nwe rebuild during the night.,And indeed, as an explanation,nit goes back to Aristotle,,so that's what -- 2,300 years ago.,It's gone in and out of fashion.,It's fashionable at the moment,because what's been shownnis that within the brain,,a whole raft of genes have been shownnto be turned on only during sleep,,and those genes are associatednwith restoration and metabolic pathways.,So there's good evidencenfor the whole restoration hypothesis. 
 What about energy conservation?,Again, perhaps intuitive.,You essentially sleep to save calories.,Now, when you do the sums,nthough, it doesn't really pan out.,If you compare an individualnwho has slept at night,,or stayed awakenand hasn't moved very much,,the energy saving of sleepingnis about 110 calories a night.,Now, that's the equivalentnof a hot dog bun.,Now, I would say that a hot dog bun,is kind of a meager return,for such a complicatednand demanding behavior as sleep.,So I'm less convincednby the energy conservation idea. 
 But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,,which is brain processingnand memory consolidation.,What we know is that,nif after you've tried to learn a task,,and you sleep-deprive individuals,,the ability to learn that task is smashed.,It's really hugely attenuated.,So sleep and memory consolidationnis also very important.,However, it's not justnthe laying down of memory,and recalling it.,What's turned out to be really exciting,is that our ability to come upnwith novel solutions to complex problems,is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.,In fact, it's been estimatednto give us a threefold advantage.,Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.,And what seems to be going onnis that, in the brain,,those neural connectionsnthat are important,,those synaptic connectionsnthat are important,,are linked and strengthened,,while those that are less importantntend to fade away and be less important. 
 OK.,So we've had three explanationsnfor why we might sleep,,and I think the important thing to realizenis that the details will vary,,and it's probable we sleepnfor multiple different reasons.,But sleep is not an indulgence.,It's not some sort of thing that we canntake on board rather casually.,I think that sleep was oncenlikened to an upgrade,from economy to business class,nyou know, the equivalent of.,It's not even an upgradenfrom economy to first class.,The critical thing to realize is thatnif you don't sleep,,you don't fly.,Essentially, you never get there.,And what's extraordinarynabout much of our society these days,is that we are desperately sleep-deprived. 
 So let's now look at sleep deprivation.,Huge sectors of societynare sleep-deprived,,and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.,So in the 1950s, good datansuggests that most of us,were getting around eight hoursnof sleep a night.,Nowadays, we sleep one and a halfnto two hours less every night,,so we're in the six-and-a-half-hoursnevery-night league.,For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.,They need nine hoursnfor full brain performance,,and many of them, on a school night,nare only getting five hours of sleep.,It's simply not enough.,If we think about other sectorsnof society -- the aged;,if you are aged, then your abilitynto sleep in a single block,is somewhat disrupted,nand many sleep, again,,less than five hours a night. 
 Shift work.,Shift work is extraordinary,,perhaps 20 percentnof the working population,,and the body clock does not shiftnto the demands of working at night.,It's locked onto the samenlight-dark cycle as the rest of us.,So when the poor oldnshift worker is going home,to try and sleep during the day,ndesperately tired,,the body clock is saying,n"Wake up. This is the time to be awake.",So the quality of sleepnthat you get as a night shift worker,is usually very poor,nagain in that sort of five-hour region.,And then, of course, tens of millionsnof people suffer from jet lag.,So who here has jet lag?,Well, my goodness gracious.,Well, thank you very muchnindeed for not falling asleep,,because that's what your brain is craving. 
 One of the things that the brain doesnis indulge in micro-sleeps,,this involuntary falling asleep,,and you have essentiallynno control over it.,Now, micro-sleeps can be sortnof somewhat embarrassing,,but they can also be deadly.,It's been estimatednthat 31 percent of drivers,will fall asleep at the wheelnat least once in their life,,and in the US, the statisticsnare pretty good:,100,000 accidents on the freewaynhave been associated with tiredness,,loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --na hundred thousand a year.,It's extraordinary.,At another level of terror,,we dip into the tragicnaccidents at Chernobyl,and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,,which was so tragically lost.,And in the investigationsnthat followed those disasters,,poor judgment as a resultnof extended shift work,and loss of vigilance and tiredness,was attributed to a big chunknof those disasters.,When you're tired and you lack sleep,,you have poor memory,nyou have poor creativity,,you have increased impulsiveness,,and you have overall poor judgment.,But my friends,nit's so much worse than that. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you are a tired brain,,the brain is craving things to wake it up.,So drugs, stimulants.,Caffeine representsnthe stimulant of choice,across much of the Western world.,Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,,and if you're a really naughtyntired brain, nicotine.,Of course, you're fueling the waking statenwith these stimulants,,and then, of course, it getsnto 11 o'clock at night,,and the brain says to itself,,"Actually, I neednto be asleep fairly shortly.,What do we do about thatnwhen I'm feeling completely wired?",Well, of course,nyou then resort to alcohol.,Now alcohol, short-term,nyou know, once or twice,,to use to mildly sedate you,ncan be very useful.,It can actually ease the sleep transition.,But what you must be so aware ofnis that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.,A biological mimic for sleep,,it sedates you.,So it actually harmsnsome of the neural processing,that's going on during memorynconsolidation and memory recall.,So it's a short-term acute measure,,but for goodness sake,,don't become addicted to alcohol,as a way of getting to sleep every night. 
 Another connectionnbetween loss of sleep is weight gain.,If you sleep aroundnabout five hours or less every night,,then you have a 50 percentnlikelihood of being obese.,What's the connection here?,Well, sleep loss seems to give risento the release of the hormone ghrelin,,the hunger hormone.,Ghrelin is released.,It gets to the brain.,The brain says, "I need carbohydrates,",and what it does is seek out carbohydratesnand particularly sugars.,So there's a link between tiredness,and the metabolic predispositionnfor weight gain: stress.,Tired people are massively stressed.,And one of the things of stress,nof course, is loss of memory,,which is what I sort of just thennhad a little lapse of.,But stress is so much more.,So, if you're acutely stressed,nnot a great problem,,but it's sustained stress associatednwith sleep loss that's the problem.,Sustained stress leadsnto suppressed immunity.,And so, tired people tend to havenhigher rates of overall infection,,and there's some very good studies,showing that shift workers, for example,nhave higher rates of cancer.,Increased levels of stressnthrow glucose into the circulation.,Glucose becomes a dominant partnof the vasculature,and essentially you becomenglucose intolerant.,Therefore, diabetes 2.,Stress increases cardiovascular diseasenas a result of raising blood pressure.,So there's a whole raft of thingsnassociated with sleep loss,that are more than justna mildly impaired brain,,which is where I think most people thinknthat sleep loss resides. 
 So at this point in the talk,nthis is a nice time to think,,"Well, do you think on the wholenI'm getting enough sleep?",So a quick show of hands.,Who feels that they're gettingnenough sleep here?,Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.,Good. We'll talk more about that later,nabout what are your tips. 
 So most of us, of course,nask the question,,"How do I know whethernI'm getting enough sleep?",Well, it's not rocket science.,If you need an alarm clock to getnyou out of bed in the morning,,if you are taking a long time to get up,,if you need lots of stimulants,,if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,,if you're told by your work colleaguesnthat you're looking tired and irritable,,chances are you are sleep-deprived.,Listen to them. Listen to yourself. 
 What do you do?,Well -- and this is slightly offensive --,sleep for dummies. 
 (Laughter) 
 Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.,The first critical thing is make itnas dark as you possibly can,,and also make it slightly cool.,Very important.,Actually, reduce your amountnof light exposure,at least half an hournbefore you go to bed.,Light increases levels of alertnessnand will delay sleep.,What's the last thing that most of usndo before we go to bed?,We stand in a massively lit bathroom,,looking into the mirrorncleaning our teeth.,It's the worst thing we can possibly donbefore we go to sleep.,Turn off those mobile phones.nTurn off those computers.,Turn off all of those thingsnthat are also going to excite the brain.,Try not to drink caffeinentoo late in the day,,ideally not after lunch. 
 Now, we've set about reducing lightnexposure before you go to bed,,but light exposure in the morning,is very good at setting the biologicalnclock to the light-dark cycle.,So seek out morning light.,Basically, listen to yourself.,Wind down.,Do those sorts of things,that you know are going to ease you off,into the honey-heavy dew of slumber. 
 OK.,That's some facts. What about some myths? 
 Teenagers are lazy.,No. Poor things.,They have a biological predispositionnto go to bed late and get up late,,so give them a break. 
 We need eight hours of sleep a night.,That's an average.,Some people need more.nSome people need less.,And what you need to donis listen to your body.,Do you need that much or do you need more?,Simple as that. 
 Old people need less sleep.,Not true.,The sleep demands of the agedndo not go down.,Essentially, sleep fragmentsnand becomes less robust,,but sleep requirements do not go down. 
 And the fourth mythnis early to bed, early to rise,makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.,Well, that's wrongnat so many different levels. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is no evidence that getting up earlynand going to bed early,gives you more wealth at all.,There's no differencenin socioeconomic status.,In my experience,,the only difference between morningnpeople and evening people,is that those people that get upnin the morning early,are just horribly smug. 
 (Laughter)

 OK.,So for the last few minutes,,what I want to do is change gears,and talk about some really new,nbreaking areas of neuroscience,,which is the associationnbetween mental health,,mental illness and sleep disruption.,We've known for 130 yearsnthat in severe mental illness,,there is always, always sleep disruption,,but it's been largely ignored.,In the 1970s, when people startednto think about this again,,they said, "Yes, well, of course you havensleep disruption in schizophrenia,,because they're on antipsychotics.,It's the antipsychotics causingnthe sleep problems,",ignoring the fact thatnfor a hundred years previously,,sleep disruption had been reportednbefore antipsychotics. 
 So what's going on?,Several groups are studying,conditions like depression,nschizophrenia and bipolar,and what's going onnin terms of sleep disruption.,We have a big study which we publishednlast year on schizophrenia,,and the data were quite extraordinary.,In those individuals with schizophrenia,,much of the time, they were awakenduring the night phase,and then they were asleep during the day.,Other groups showed no 24-hournpatterns whatsoever --,their sleep was absolutely smashed.,And some had no ability to regulatentheir sleep by the light-dark cycle.,They were getting up later and laternand later and later each night.,It was smashed. 
 So what's going on?,And the really exciting news,is that mental illness and sleepnare not simply associated,,but they are physically linkednwithin the brain.,The neural networks that predisposenyou to normal sleep,,give you normal sleep,,and those that give you normalnmental health, are overlapping.,And what's the evidence for that?,Well, genes that have been shown,to be very importantnin the generation of normal sleep,,when mutated, when changed,,also predispose individualsnto mental health problems.,And last year, we published a study,which showed that a genenthat's been linked to schizophrenia,,when mutated, also smashes the sleep.,So we have evidencenof a genuine mechanistic overlap,between these two important systems. 
 Other work flowed from these studies.,The first was that sleep disruption,actually precedes certain typesnof mental illness,,and we've shown thatnin those young individuals,who are at high risknof developing bipolar disorder,,they already have a sleep abnormality,prior to any clinicalndiagnosis of bipolar.,The other bit of datanwas that sleep disruption,may actually exacerbate, make worse,nthe mental illness state.,My colleague Dan Freemannhas used a range of agents,which have stabilized sleepnand reduced levels of paranoia,in those individuals by 50 percent. 
 So what have we got?,We've got, in these connections,nsome really exciting things.,In terms of the neuroscience,,by understanding these two systems,,we're really beginning to understandnhow both sleep and mental illness,are generated and regulatednwithin the brain.,The second areanis that if we can use sleep,and sleep disruptionnas an early warning signal,,then we have the chance of going in.,If we know these individualsnare vulnerable,,early intervention then becomes possible.,And the third, which I thinknis the most exciting,,is that we can thinknof the sleep centers within the brain,as a new therapeutic target.,Stabilize sleep in those individualsnwho are vulnerable,,we can certainly make them healthier,,but also alleviate some of the appallingnsymptoms of mental illness. 
 So let me just finish.,What I started by saying is:nTake sleep seriously.,Our attitudes toward sleepnare so very different,from a pre-industrial age,,when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.,We used to understand intuitivelynthe importance of sleep.,And this isn't some sortnof crystal-waving nonsense.,This is a pragmatic responsento good health.,If you have good sleep,nit increases your concentration,,attention, decision-making,ncreativity, social skills, health.,If you get sleep, it reducesnyour mood changes, your stress,,your levels of anger, your impulsivity,,and your tendency to drink and take drugs.,And we finished by saying,that an understandingnof the neuroscience of sleep,is really informing the way we think,about some of the causesnof mental illness,,and indeed is providing us new ways,to treat these incrediblyndebilitating conditions. 
 Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,,"Sleep is God. Go worship.",And I can only recommendnthat you do the same. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)So when I was in Morocco,,in Casablanca, not so long ago,,I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.,Faiza showed me photos of her infant son,and she told me the story of his conception,npregnancy, and delivery. 
 It was a remarkable tale,,but Faiza saved the best for last.,"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.,"I have two medical certificates to prove it." 
 This is the modern Middle East,,where two millennia after the coming of Christ,,virgin births are still a fact of life. 
 Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard nover the years, traveling across the Arab region,talking to people about sex.,Now, I know this might sound like a dream job,,or possibly a highly dubious occupation, 
 but for me, it's something else altogether.,I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.,But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots. 
 Like so many who straddle East and West,,I've been drawn, over the years, to try to betternunderstand my origins.,That I chose to look at sex comes from nmy background in HIV/AIDS,,as a writer and a researcher and an activist.,Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemicnin the Middle East and North Africa,,which is one of only two regions in the worldnwhere HIV/AIDS is still on the rise. 
 Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens,with which to study any society,,because what happens in our intimate lives,is reflected by forces on a bigger stage:,in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, nin gender and generations.,As I found, if you really want to know a people,,you start by looking inside their bedrooms. 
 Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.,But running across it are three red lines --,these are topics you are not supposed nto challenge in word or deed. 
 The first of these is politics.,But the Arab Spring has changed all that,,in uprisings which have blossomed nacross the region since 2011.,Now while those in power, old and new,,continue to cling to business as usual,,millions are still pushing back,,and pushing forward to what they hopenwill be a better life. 
 That second red line is religion.,But now religion and politics are connected,,with the rise of such groups as the nMuslim Brotherhood.,And some people, at least, are starting nto ask questions,about the role of Islam in public and private life. 
 You know, as for that third red line, nthat off-limits subject,,what do you think it might be? 
 Audience: Sex. 
 Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you. 
 Audience: Sex. 
 SEF: Again, please don't be shy. 
 Audience: Sex. 
 SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter),Across the Arab region, the only acceptedncontext for sex is marriage --,approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion,and registered by the state.,Marriage is your ticket to adulthood.,If you don't tie the knot, you can't nmove out of your parents' place,,and you're not supposed to be having sex,,and you're definitely not supposed nto be having children. 
 It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress,which resists any assault, any alternative.,And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo,against premarital sex, against condoms,,against abortion, against homosexuality,,you name it. 
 Faiza was living proof of this.,Her virginity statement was nnot a piece of wishful thinking.,Although the major religions of the regionnextoll premarital chastity,,in a patriarchy, boys will be boys.,Men have sex before marriage,,and people more or less turn a blind eye. 
 Not so for women,,who are expected to be virgins non their wedding night --,that is, to turn up with your hymen intact.,This is not a question of individual concern,,this is a matter of family honor, nand in particular, men's honor. 
 And so women and their relatives,will go to great lengths to preserve nthis tiny piece of anatomy --,from female genital mutilation,,to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery. 
 Faiza chose a different route:,non-vaginal sex.,Only she became pregnant all the same.,But Faiza didn't actually realize this,,because there's so little nsexuality education in schools,,and so little communication in the family. 
 When her condition became hard to hide,,Faiza's mother helped her flee nher father and brothers.,This is because honor killings are a real threat,for untold numbers of women in the Arab region.,And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at na hospital in Casablanca,,the man who offered to help her,,instead tried to rape her. 
 Sadly, Faiza is not alone.,In Egypt, where my research is focused,,I have seen plenty of trouble nin and out of the citadel.,There are legions of young men,who can't afford to get married,,because marriage has become na very expensive proposition.,They are expected to bear the burdennof costs in married life,,but they can't find jobs.,This is one of the major drivers nof the recent uprisings,,and it is one of the reasons for the nrising age of marriage,in much of the Arab region. 
 There are career women who want to get married,,but can't find a husband,,because they defy gender expectations,,or as one young female doctor nin Tunisia put it to me,,"The women, they are becoming more and more open.,But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage." 
 And then there are men and women who ncross the heterosexual line,,who have sex with their own sex,,or who have a different gender identity.,They are on the receiving end of lawsnwhich punish their activities,,even their appearance.,And they face a daily struggle with social stigma,,with family despair,,and with religious fire and brimstone. 
 Now, it's not as if it's all rosy nin the marital bed either.,Couples who are looking for greater happiness,,greater sexual happiness in their married lives,,but are at a loss of how to achieve it,,especially wives, who are afraid nof being seen as bad women,if they show some spark in the bedroom. 
 And then there are those whose marriages,are actually a veil for prostitution.,They have been sold by their families,,often to wealthy Arab tourists.,This is just one face of a booming nsex trade across the Arab region. 
 Now raise your hand if any of nthis is sounding familiar to you,,from your part of the world.,Yeah. It's not as if the Arab worldnhas a monopoly on sexual hangups. 
 And although we don't yet havenan Arab Kinsey Report,to tell us exactly what's happening ninside bedrooms across the Arab region,,It's pretty clear that nsomething is not right.,Double standards for men and women,,sex as a source of shame,,family control limiting individual choices,,and a vast gulf between appearance and reality:,what people are doing,and what they're willing to admit to,,and a general reluctance to move nbeyond private whispers,to a serious and sustained public discussion. 
 As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,,"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.,Football, everybody talks about it,,but hardly anyone plays.,But sex, everybody is doing it,,but nobody wants to talk about it."n(Laughter) 
 (Music) (In Arabic) 
 SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,,which if you follow it,nwill make you happy in life. 
 When your husband reaches out to you,,when he seizes a part of your body,,sigh deeply and look at him lustily. 
 When he penetrates you with his penis,,try to talk flirtatiously and nmove yourself in harmony with him. 
 Hot stuff!,And it might sound that these handy hints,come from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.,But in fact, they come fromna 10th-century Arabic book,called "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,",which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,,and everything in between. 
 The Encyclopedia is just one nin a long line of Arabic erotica,,much of it written by religious scholars.,Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad,,there is a rich tradition in Islam,of talking frankly about sex:,not just its problems, but also its pleasures,,and not just for men, but also for women.,A thousand years ago, we used to have nwhole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.,Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature,,position and preference, a body of language,that was rich enough to make up the body nof the woman you see on this page. 
 Today, this history is largely unknown nin the Arab region.,Even by educated people, who oftennfeel more comfortable talking about sex,in a foreign language than they donin their own tongue.,Today's sexual landscape looksna lot like Europe and America,on the brink of the sexual revolution. 
 But while the West has opened on sex,,what we found is that Arab societies appearnto have been moving in the opposite direction.,In Egypt and many of its neighbors,,this closing down is part of a wider closing,in political, social and cultural thought.,And it is the product of a complex historical process,,one which has gained ground with the rise nof Islamic conservatism,since the late 1970s.,"Just say no" is what conservatives naround the world,say to any challenge to the sexual status quo.,In the Arab region, they brand these attemptsnas a Western conspiracy,to undermine traditional Arabnand Islamic values.,But what's really at stake here,is one of their most powerful tools of control:,sex wrapped up in religion. 
 But history shows us that neven as recently,as our fathers' and grandfathers' day,,there have been times of greater pragmatism,,and tolerance, and a willingnessnto consider other interpretations:,be it abortion, or masturbation, or even nthe incendiary topic of homosexuality.,It is not black and white,nas conservatives would have us believe.,In these, as in so many other matters,,Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.,(Laughter) 
 Over my travels,,I've met men and women nacross the Arab region,who've been exploring that spectrum --,sexologists who are tryingnto help couples,find greater happiness in their marriages,,innovators who are managing to get nsexuality education into schools,,small groups of men and women,,lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,,who are reaching out to their peers,with online initiatives and real-world support.,Women, and increasingly men,nwho are starting to speak out,and push back against sexual violence,on the streets and in the home.,Groups that are trying to help sex workersnprotect themselves against HIV,and other occupational hazards,,and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza,find a place in society, and critically,nstay with their kids. 
 Now these efforts are small, nthey're often underfunded,,and they face formidable opposition.,But I am optimistic that, in the long run,,times are changing, and they and their ideas,will gain ground.,Social change doesn't happen in the Arab regionnthrough dramatic confrontation,,beating or indeed baring of breasts,,but rather through negotiation. 
 What we're talking here is not about a nsexual revolution,,but a sexual evolution, nlearning from other parts of the world,,adapting to local conditions,,forging our own path,nnot following one blazed by another.,That path, I hope, will one day lead us nto the right to control our own bodies,,and to access the information nand services we need,to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.,The right to express our ideas freely,,to marry whom we choose, nto choose our own partners,,to be sexually active or not,nto decide whether to have children and when,,all this without violence or force or discrimination. 
 Now we are very far from this nacross the Arab region,,and so much needs to change:,law, education, media, the economy,,the list goes on and on,,and it is the work of a generation, at least. 
 But it begins with a journey that I myself have made,,asking hard questions of received wisdoms,in sexual life.,And it is a journey which hasnonly served to strengthen my faith,,and my appreciation of local histories and cultures,by showing me possibilities nwhere I once only saw absolutes. 
 Now given the turmoil in manyncountries in the Arab region,,talking about sex, nchallenging the taboos,,seeking alternatives might sound likensomething of a luxury. 
 But at this critical moment in history,,if we do not anchor freedom and justice,,dignity and equality,,privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,nin our sexual lives,,we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. 
 The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,nand that is true for us all.,no matter where we live and love. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the middle of my Ph.D.,,I was hopelessly stuck.,Every research direction that I tried,led to a dead end.,It seemed like my basic assumptions,just stopped working.,I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,,and I lost all sense of direction.,I stopped shaving.,I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.,I felt unworthy,of stepping across the gates of the university,,because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton,or any other scientist whose results,I had learned about, because in science,,we just learn about the results, not the process.,And so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist. 
 But I had enough support,and I made it through,and discovered something new about nature.,This is an amazing feeling of calmness,,being the only person in the world,who knows a new law of nature.,And I started the second project in my Ph.D,,and it happened again.,I got stuck and I made it through.,And I started thinking,,maybe there's a pattern here.,I asked the other graduate students, and they said,,"Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,,except nobody told us about it.",We'd all studied science as if it's a series,of logical steps between question and answer,,but doing research is nothing like that. 
 At the same time, I was also studying,to be an improvisation theater actor.,So physics by day,,and by night, laughing, jumping, singing,,playing my guitar.,Improvisation theater,,just like science, goes into the unknown,,because you have to make a scene onstage,without a director, without a script,,without having any idea what you'll portray,or what the other characters will do.,But unlike science,,in improvisation theater, they tell you from day one,what's going to happen tonyou when you get onstage.,You're going to fail miserably.,You're going to get stuck.,And we would practice staying creative,inside that stuck place.,For example, we had an exercise,where we all stood in a circle,,and each person had to donthe world's worst tap dance,,and everybody else applauded,and cheered you on,,supporting you onstage. 
 When I became a professor,and had to guide my own students,through their research projects,,I realized again,,I don't know what to do.,I'd studied thousands of hours of physics,,biology, chemistry,,but not one hour, not one concept,on how to mentor, how to guide someone,to go together into the unknown,,about motivation. 
 So I turned to improvisation theater,,and I told my students from day one,what's going to happen when you start research,,and this has to do with our mental schema,of what research will be like.,Because you see, whenever people do anything,,for example if I want to touch this blackboard,,my brain first builds up a schema,,a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do,before I even start moving my hand,,and if I get blocked,,if my schema doesn't match reality,,that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.,That's why your schemas had better match reality.,But if you believe the way science is taught,,and if you believe textbooks, you're liable,to have the following schema of research.,If A is the question,,and B is the answer,,then research is a direct path.,The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,,or a student gets depressed,,it's perceived as something utterly wrong,and causes tremendous stress.,And that's why I teach my students,a more realistic schema.,Here's an example,where things don't match your schema.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So I teach my students a different schema.,If A is the question,,B is the answer,,stay creative in the cloud,,and you start going,,and experiments don't work, experiments don't work,,experiments don't work, experiments don't work,,until you reach a place linkednwith negative emotions,where it seems like your basic assumptions,have stopped making sense,,like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.,And I call this place the cloud.,Now you can be lost in the cloud,for a day, a week, a month, a year,,a whole career,,but sometimes, if you're lucky enough,and you have enough support,,you can see in the materials at hand,,or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,,a new answer,,C, and you decide to go for it.,And experiments don't work, experiments don't work,,but you get there,,and then you tell everyone about it,by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,,which is a great way to communicate,,but as long as you don't forget the path,that brought you there. 
 Now this cloud is an inherent part,of research, an inherent part of our craft,,because the cloud stands guard at the boundary.,It stands guard at the boundary,between the known,and the unknown,,because in order to discover something truly new,,at least one of your basicnassumptions has to change,,and that means that in science,,we do something quite heroic.,Every day, we try to bring ourselves,to the boundary betweennthe known and the unknown,and face the cloud. 
 Now notice that I put B,in the land of the known,,because we knew about it in the beginning,,but C is always more interesting,and more important than B.,So B is essential in order to get going,,but C is much more profound,,and that's the amazing thing about resesarch. 
 Now just knowing that word, the cloud,,has been transformational in my research group,,because students come to me and say,,"Uri, I'm in the cloud,",and I say, "Great, you must be feeling miserable.",(Laughter),But I'm kind of happy,,because we might be close to the boundary,between the known and the unknown,,and we stand a chance of discovering,something truly new,,since the way our mind works,,it's just knowing that the cloud,is normal, it's essential,,and in fact beautiful,,we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,,and it detoxifies the feeling that something,is deeply wrong with me.,And as a mentor, I know what to do,,which is to step up my support for the student,,because research in psychology shows,that if you're feeling fear and despair,,your mind narrows down,to very safe and conservative ways of thinking.,If you'd like to explore the risky paths,needed to get out of the cloud,,you need other emotions --,solidarity, support, hope —,that come with your connection from somebody else,,so like in improvisation theater,,in science, it's best to walk into the unknown,together. 
 So knowing about the cloud,,you also learn from improvisation theater,a very effective way to have conversations,inside the cloud.,It's based on the central principle,of improvisation theater,,so here improvisation theater,came to my help again.,It's called saying "Yes, and",to the offers made by other actors.,That means accepting the offers,and building on them, saying, "Yes, and.",For example, if one actor says,,"Here is a pool of water,",and the other actor says,,"No, that's just a stage,",the improvisation is over.,It's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.,That's called blocking.,If you're not mindful of communications,,scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking. 
 Saying "Yes, and" sounds like this. 
 "Here is a pool of water."n"Yeah, let's jump in." 
 "Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail.,It's pulling us to the moon!" 
 So saying "Yes, and" bypasses our inner critic.,We all have an inner critic,that kind of guards what we say,,so people don't think that we're obscene,or crazy or unoriginal,,and science is full of the fear,of appearing unoriginal.,Saying "Yes, and" bypasses the critic,and unlocks hidden voices of creativity,you didn't even know that you had,,and they often carry the answer,about the cloud. 
 So you see, knowing about the cloud,and about saying "Yes, and",made my lab very creative.,Students started playing off of each others' ideas,,and we made surprising discoveries,in the interface between physics and biology.,For example, we were stuck for a year,trying to understand the intricate,biochemical networks inside our cells,,and we said, "We are deeply in the cloud,",and we had a playful conversation,where my student Shai Shen Orr said,,"Let's just draw this on anpiece of paper, this network,",and instead of saying,,"But we've done that so many times,and it doesn't work,",I said, "Yes, and,let's use a very big piece of paper,",and then Ron Milo said,,"Let's use a gigantic architect's,blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,",and we printed out the network and looked at it,,and that's where we madenour most important discovery,,that this complicated network is just made,of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns,like motifs in a stained glass window.,We call them network motifs,,and they're the elementary circuits,that help us understand,the logic of the way cells make decisions,in all organisms, including our body. 
 Soon enough, after this,,I started being invited to give talks,to thousands of scientists across the world,,but the knowledge about the cloud,and saying "Yes, and",just stayed within my own lab,,because you see, in science,nwe don't talk about the process,,anything subjective or emotional.,We talk about the results.,So there was no way to talk about it in conferences.,That was unthinkable.,And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck,without even having a word to describe,what they're seeing,,and their ways of thinking,narrowed down to very safe paths,,their science didn't reach its full potential,,and they were miserable.,I thought, that's the way it is.,I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,,and if everybody else does the same,,science will eventually become,more and more better and better. 
 That way of thinking got turned on its head,when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller,give a talk about her experiences,as a woman in science.,And she asked,,"Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective,and emotional aspects of doing science?,It's not by chance. It's a matter of values.",You see, science seeks knowledge,that's objective and rational.,That's the beautiful thing about science.,But we also have a cultural myth,that the doing of science,,what we do every day to get that knowledge,,is also only objective and rational,,like Mr. Spock.,And when you label something,as objective and rational,,automatically, the other side,,the subjective and emotional,,become labeled as non-science,or anti-science or threatening to science,,and we just don't talk about it.,And when I heard that,,that science has a culture,,everything clicked into place for me,,because if science has a culture,,culture can be changed,,and I can be a change agent,working to change the culturenof science wherever I could.,And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,,I talked about my science,,and then I talked about the importance,of the subjective and emotionalnaspects of doing science,and how we should talk about them,,and I looked at the audience,,and they were cold.,They couldn't hear what I was saying,in the context of a 10 back-to-back,PowerPoint presentation conference.,And I tried again and again,nconference after conference,,but I wasn't getting through.,I was in the cloud. 
 And eventually I managed to get out the cloud,using improvisation and music.,Since then, every conference I go to,,I give a science talk and a second, special talk,called "Love and fear in the lab,",and I start it off by doing a song,about scientists' greatest fear,,which is that we work hard,,we discover something new,,and somebody else publishes it before we do.,We call it being scooped,,and being scooped feels horrible.,It makes us afraid to talk to each other,,which is no fun,,because we came to science to share our ideas,and to learn from each other,,and so I do a blues song,,which — (Applause) —,called "Scooped Again,",and I ask the audience to be my backup singers,,and I tell them, "Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'",It sounds like this: "Scoop, scoop!",Sounds like this. 
 ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ 
 ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ 
 And then we go for it. 
 ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ 
 ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ 
 ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ 
 ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ 
 ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ 
 ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ 
 ♪ I've been scooped again ♪ 
 ♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪ 
 ♪ Oh mama, can't you feel my pain ♪ 
 ♪ Heavens help me, I've been scooped again ♪,(Applause) 
 Thank you.,Thank you for your backup singing. 
 So everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,,notices that there's other scientists around them,with shared issues,,and we start talking about the emotional,and subjective things that go on in research.,It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.,Finally, we can talk aboutnthis in a scientific conference.,And scientists have gone on to form peer groups,where they meet regularly,and create a space to talk about the emotional,and subjective things thatnhappen as they're mentoring,,as they're going into the unknown,,and even started courses,about the process of doing science,,about going into the unknown together,,and many other things. 
 So my vision is that,,just like every scientist knows the word "atom,",that matter is made out of atoms,,every scientist would know the words,like "the cloud," saying "Yes, and,",and science will become much more creative,,make many, many more unexpected discoveries,for the benefit of us all,,and would also be much more playful.,And what I might ask you to remember from this talk,is that next time you face,a problem you can't solve,in work or in life,,there's a word for what you're going to see:,the cloud.,And you can go through the cloud,not alone but together,with someone who is your source of support,to say "Yes, and" to your ideas,,to help you say "Yes, and" to your own ideas,,to increase the chance that,,through the wisps of the cloud,,you'll find that moment of calmness,where you get your first glimpse,of your unexpected discovery,,your C. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,,and this little white dog called Maui,was staying with me.,Half the city was dark because of a power cut,,and I was living on the dark side.,Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,,so I had to carry him up the stairs,,actually down the stairs first, for his walk,,and then bring him back up.,I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water,up to the seventh floor every day.,And through all of this,,I had to hold a torch between my teeth.,The stores nearby were out of flashlights,and batteries and bread.,For a shower, I walked 40 blocks,to a branch of my gym. 
 But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.,It was just as critical for me to be the first person in,at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers,to juice my multiple devices.,I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries,and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.,I wasn't the only one.,Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue,under their umbrellas charging their cell phones,from outlets on the street.,Nature had just reminded us,that it was stronger than all our technology,,and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired. 
 I think there's nothing like a crisis,to tell you what's really important and what's not,,and Sandy made me realize that our devices,and their connectivity matter to us,right up there with food and shelter.,The self as we once knew it no longer exists,,and I think that an abstract, digital universe,has become a part of our identity,,and I want to talk to you about what I think that means. 
 I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self,because the self and fiction have a lot in common.,They're both stories, interpretations.,You and I can experience things without a story.,We might run up the stairs too quickly,and we might get breathless.,But the larger sense that we have of our lives,,the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.,Our story of our life is based on direct experience,,but it's embellished.,A novel needs scene after scene to build,,and the story of our life needs an arc as well.,It needs months and years.,Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.,But the story is not about these chapters.,It's the whole book.,It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,,the victories and the disappointments,,but it's because how because of these,,and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,,we find our place in the world,and we change it and we change ourselves.,Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:,a long arc of time that is our lifespan,,and the timeframe of direct experience,that is the moment.,Now the self that experiences directly,can only exist in the moment,,but the one that narrates needs several moments,,a whole sequence of them,,and that's why our full sense of self,needs both immersive experience,and the flow of time.,Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,,in the erosion of a grain of sand,,in the budding of a little bud into a rose.,Without it, we would have no music.,Our own emotions and state of mind,often encode time,,regret or nostalgia about the past,,hope or dread about the future. 
 I think that technology has altered that flow of time.,The overall time that we have for our narrative,,our lifespan, has been increasing,,but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.,It has shrunk because our instruments enable us,in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,,and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding,of the material world,,and this granular understanding,has generated reams of data,that our brains can no longer comprehend,and for which we need more and more complicated computers.,All of this to say that the gap,between what we can perceive and what we can measure,is only going to widen.,Science can do things with and in a picosecond,,but you and I are never going to have the inner experience,of a millionth of a millionth of a second.,You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,,to the sun, the moon and the seasons,,and this is why we need that long arc of time,with the past, the present and the future,to see things for what they are,,to separate signal from noise,and the self from sensations.,We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,,not just in the material world,,but in our own intentions and our motivations.,What happens when that arrow goes awry?,What happens when time warps? 
 So many of us today have the sensation,that time's arrow is pointing everywhere,and nowhere at once.,This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world,in the same way that it does in the natural one.,We all know that the Internet has shrunk space,as well as time.,Far away over there is now here.,News from India is a stream on my smartphone app,whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.,And that's not all.,Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,,your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,,because the Internet also archives,,and it warps the past.,With no distinction left between the past,,the present and the future, and the here or there,,we are left with this moment everywhere,,this moment that I'll call the digital now. 
 Just how can we prioritize,in the landscape of the digital now?,This digital now is not the present,,because it's always a few seconds ahead,,with Twitter streams that are already trending,and news from other time zones.,This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot,or the second that you bite into a pastry,or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.,This now bears very little physical,or psychological reference to our own state.,Its focus, instead, is to distract us,at every turn on the road.,Every digital landmark is an invitation,to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else,and do something else.,Are you reading an interview by an author?,Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.,Like it. Find other books exactly like his.,Find other people reading those books.,Travel can be liberating,,but when it is incessant, we become,permanent exiles without repose.,Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly,for its own sake. 
 Not just is the digital now far from the present,,but it's in direct competition with it,,and this is because not just am I absent from it,,but so are you.,Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.,And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.,I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,,shop for Parisian macarons,,and leave video messages that get picked up later.,At all times, I can operate,at a different rhythm and pace from you,,while I sustain the illusion,that I'm tapped into you in real time. 
 Sandy was a reminder,of how such an illusion can shatter.,There were those with power and water,,and those without.,There are those who went back to their lives,,and those who are still displaced,after so many months.,For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate,the illusion for those who have it that everyone does,,and then, like an ironic slap in the face,,it makes it true.,For example, it's said that there are more people,in India with access to cell phones than toilets.,Now if this rift, which is already so great,in many parts of the world,,between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,,isn't somehow bridged,,there will be ruptures between the digital,and the real.,For us as individuals who live in the digital now,and spend most of our waking moments in it,,the challenge is to live in two streams of time,that are parallel and almost simultaneous.,How does one live inside distraction? 
 We might think that those younger than us,,those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.,Possibly, but I remember my childhood.,I remember my grandfather revising,the capitals of the world with me.,Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,,and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.,If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information,with apps and hyperlinks,,but it really wouldn't be the same,,because much later, I went to Vienna,,and I went to the Spanish riding school,,and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.,Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,,on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter,and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.,And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,,I get back that feeling of being a child,,hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself,on his shoulder,,and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.,What I had with my grandfather was wrapped,so often in information and knowledge and fact,,but it was about so much more,than information or knowledge or fact.,Time-warping technology challenges,our deepest core,,because we are able to archive the past,and some of it becomes hard to forget,,even as the current moment,is increasingly unmemorable.,We want to clutch, and we are left instead,clutching at a series of static moments.,They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them. 
 By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,,but time is not data.,It cannot be stored.,You and I know exactly what it means like,to be truly present in a moment.,It might have happened while we were,playing an instrument,,or looking into the eyes of someone we've known,for a very long time.,At such moments, our selves are complete.,The self that lives in the long narrative arc,and the self that experiences the moment,become one.,The present encapsulates the past,and a promise for the future.,The present joins a flow of time,from before and after. 
 I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.,I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope,and she tucked up her sari,and she jumped over it.,I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,,cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.,My grandmother taught me that things happen,in the time they take, that time can't be fought,,and because it will pass and it will move,,we owe the present moment our full attention.,Attention is time.,One of my yoga instructors once said,that love is attention,,and definitely from my grandmother,,love and attention were one and the same thing.,The digital world cannibalizes time,,and in doing so, I want to suggest,that what it threatens,is the completeness of ourselves.,It threatens the flow of love.,But we don't need to let it.,We can choose otherwise.,We've seen again and again,just how creative technology can be,,and in our lives and in our actions,,we can choose those solutions and those innovations,and those moments that restore the flow of time,instead of fragmenting it.,We can slow down and we can tune in,to the ebb and flow of time.,We can choose to take time back. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to tell you a story,connecting the notorious privacy incident,involving Adam and Eve,,and the remarkable shift in the boundaries,between public and private which has occurred,in the past 10 years. 
 You know the incident.,Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden,realize they are naked.,They freak out.,And the rest is history. 
 Nowadays, Adam and Eve,would probably act differently. 
 [@Adam Last nite was a blast! loved dat apple LOL] 
 [@Eve yep.. babe, know what happened to my pants tho?] 
 We do reveal so much more information,about ourselves online than ever before,,and so much information about us,is being collected by organizations.,Now there is much to gain and benefit,from this massive analysis of personal information,,or big data,,but there are also complex tradeoffs that come,from giving away our privacy.,And my story is about these tradeoffs. 
 We start with an observation which, in my mind,,has become clearer and clearer in the past few years,,that any personal information,can become sensitive information.,Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos,were shot worldwide,,but only a minuscule proportion of them,were actually uploaded online.,In 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month,,2.5 billion photos were uploaded,,most of them identified.,In the same span of time,,computers' ability to recognize people in photos,improved by three orders of magnitude.,What happens when you combine,these technologies together:,increasing availability of facial data;,improving facial recognizing ability by computers;,but also cloud computing,,which gives anyone in this theater,the kind of computational power,which a few years ago was only the domain,of three-letter agencies;,and ubiquitous computing,,which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer,,to connect to the Internet,and do there hundreds of thousands,of face metrics in a few seconds?,Well, we conjecture that the result,of this combination of technologies,will be a radical change in our very notions,of privacy and anonymity. 
 To test that, we did an experiment,on Carnegie Mellon University campus.,We asked students who were walking by,to participate in a study,,and we took a shot with a webcam,,and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop.,While they were filling out the survey,,we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster,,and we started using a facial recognizer,to match that shot to a database,of some hundreds of thousands of images,which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles.,By the time the subject reached the last page,on the survey, the page had been dynamically updated,with the 10 best matching photos,which the recognizer had found,,and we asked the subjects to indicate,whether he or she found themselves in the photo. 
 Do you see the subject?,Well, the computer did, and in fact did so,for one out of three subjects. 
 So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face,,offline or online, and we can use facial recognition,to give a name to that anonymous face,thanks to social media data.,But a few years back, we did something else.,We started from social media data,,we combined it statistically with data,from U.S. government social security,,and we ended up predicting social security numbers,,which in the United States,are extremely sensitive information. 
 Do you see where I'm going with this?,So if you combine the two studies together,,then the question becomes,,can you start from a face and,,using facial recognition, find a name,and publicly available information,about that name and that person,,and from that publicly available information,infer non-publicly available information,,much more sensitive ones,which you link back to the face?,And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did.,Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.,[27\% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)],But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app,which uses the phone's internal camera,to take a shot of a subject,and then upload it to a cloud,and then do what I just described to you in real time:,looking for a match, finding public information,,trying to infer sensitive information,,and then sending back to the phone,so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject,,an example of augmented reality,,probably a creepy example of augmented reality.,In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available,,just as a proof of concept. 
 In fact, take these technologies,and push them to their logical extreme.,Imagine a future in which strangers around you,will look at you through their Google Glasses,or, one day, their contact lenses,,and use seven or eight data points about you,to infer anything else,which may be known about you.,What will this future without secrets look like?,And should we care? 
 We may like to believe,that the future with so much wealth of data,would be a future with no more biases,,but in fact, having so much information,doesn't mean that we will make decisions,which are more objective.,In another experiment, we presented to our subjects,information about a potential job candidate.,We included in this information some references,to some funny, absolutely legal,,but perhaps slightly embarrassing information,that the subject had posted online.,Now interestingly, among our subjects,,some had posted comparable information,,and some had not.,Which group do you think,was more likely to judge harshly our subject?,Paradoxically, it was the group,who had posted similar information,,an example of moral dissonance. 
 Now you may be thinking,,this does not apply to me,,because I have nothing to hide.,But in fact, privacy is not about,having something negative to hide.,Imagine that you are the H.R. director,of a certain organization, and you receive résumés,,and you decide to find more information about the candidates.,Therefore, you Google their names,and in a certain universe,,you find this information.,Or in a parallel universe, you find this information.,Do you think that you would be equally likely,to call either candidate for an interview?,If you think so, then you are not,like the U.S. employers who are, in fact,,part of our experiment, meaning we did exactly that.,We created Facebook profiles, manipulating traits,,then we started sending out résumés to companies in the U.S.,,and we detected, we monitored,,whether they were searching for our candidates,,and whether they were acting on the information,they found on social media. And they were.,Discrimination was happening through social media,for equally skilled candidates. 
 Now marketers like us to believe,that all information about us will always,be used in a manner which is in our favor.,But think again. Why should that be always the case?,In a movie which came out a few years ago,,"Minority Report," a famous scene,had Tom Cruise walk in a mall,and holographic personalized advertising,would appear around him.,Now, that movie is set in 2054,,about 40 years from now,,and as exciting as that technology looks,,it already vastly underestimates,the amount of information that organizations,can gather about you, and how they can use it,to influence you in a way that you will not even detect. 
 So as an example, this is another experiment,actually we are running, not yet completed.,Imagine that an organization has access,to your list of Facebook friends,,and through some kind of algorithm,they can detect the two friends that you like the most.,And then they create, in real time,,a facial composite of these two friends.,Now studies prior to ours have shown that people,don't recognize any longer even themselves,in facial composites, but they react,to those composites in a positive manner.,So next time you are looking for a certain product,,and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it,,it will not be just a standard spokesperson.,It will be one of your friends,,and you will not even know that this is happening. 
 Now the problem is that,the current policy mechanisms we have,to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information,are like bringing a knife to a gunfight.,One of these mechanisms is transparency,,telling people what you are going to do with their data.,And in principle, that's a very good thing.,It's necessary, but it is not sufficient.,Transparency can be misdirected.,You can tell people what you are going to do,,and then you still nudge them to disclose,arbitrary amounts of personal information. 
 So in yet another experiment, this one with students,,we asked them to provide information,about their campus behavior,,including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one.,[Have you ever cheated in an exam?],Now to one group of subjects, we told them,,"Only other students will see your answers.",To another group of subjects, we told them,,"Students and faculty will see your answers.",Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked,,in the sense that the first group of subjects,were much more likely to disclose than the second.,It makes sense, right?,But then we added the misdirection.,We repeated the experiment with the same two groups,,this time adding a delay,between the time we told subjects,how we would use their data,and the time we actually started answering the questions. 
 How long a delay do you think we had to add,in order to nullify the inhibitory effect,of knowing that faculty would see your answers?,Ten minutes?,Five minutes?,One minute?,How about 15 seconds?,Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups,disclose the same amount of information,,as if the second group now no longer cares,for faculty reading their answers. 
 Now I have to admit that this talk so far,may sound exceedingly gloomy,,but that is not my point.,In fact, I want to share with you the fact that,there are alternatives.,The way we are doing things now is not the only way,they can done, and certainly not the best way,they can be done.,When someone tells you, "People don't care about privacy,",consider whether the game has been designed,and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy,,and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur,is already halfway through the process,of being able to protect yourself.,When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible,with the benefits of big data,,consider that in the last 20 years,,researchers have created technologies,to allow virtually any electronic transactions,to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner.,We can browse the Internet anonymously.,We can send emails that can only be read,by the intended recipient, not even the NSA.,We can have even privacy-preserving data mining.,In other words, we can have the benefits of big data,while protecting privacy.,Of course, these technologies imply a shifting,of cost and revenues,between data holders and data subjects,,which is why, perhaps, you don't hear more about them. 
 Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden.,There is a second privacy interpretation,of the story of the Garden of Eden,which doesn't have to do with the issue,of Adam and Eve feeling naked,and feeling ashamed.,You can find echoes of this interpretation,in John Milton's "Paradise Lost.",In the garden, Adam and Eve are materially content.,They're happy. They are satisfied.,However, they also lack knowledge,and self-awareness.,The moment they eat the aptly named,fruit of knowledge,,that's when they discover themselves.,They become aware. They achieve autonomy.,The price to pay, however, is leaving the garden.,So privacy, in a way, is both the means,and the price to pay for freedom. 
 Again, marketers tell us,that big data and social media,are not just a paradise of profit for them,,but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us.,We get free content.,We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps.,But in fact, in a few years, organizations,will know so much about us,,they will be able to infer our desires,before we even form them, and perhaps,buy products on our behalf,before we even know we need them. 
 Now there was one English author,who anticipated this kind of future,where we would trade away,our autonomy and freedom for comfort.,Even more so than George Orwell,,the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley.,In "Brave New World," he imagines a society,where technologies that we created,originally for freedom,end up coercing us.,However, in the book, he also offers us a way out,of that society, similar to the path,that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden.,In the words of the Savage,,regaining autonomy and freedom is possible,,although the price to pay is steep.,So I do believe that one of the defining fights,of our times will be the fight,for the control over personal information,,the fight over whether big data will become a force,for freedom,,rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us. 
 Right now, many of us,do not even know that the fight is going on,,but it is, whether you like it or not.,And at the risk of playing the serpent,,I will tell you that the tools for the fight,are here, the awareness of what is going on,,and in your hands,,just a few clicks away. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to reimagine education.,The last year,has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.,It starts with an M.,MOOC: massive open online courses.,Many organizations,are offering these online courses,to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.,Anybody who has an Internet connection,and the will to learn can access these great courses,from excellent universities,and get a credential at the end of it.,Now, in this discussion today,,I'm going to focus,on a different aspect of MOOCs.,We are taking what we are learning,and the technologies we are developing in the large,and applying them in the small,to create a blended model of education,to really reinvent and reimagine,what we do in the classroom. 
 Now, our classrooms could use change.,So, here's a classroom,at this little three-letter institute,in the Northeast of America, MIT.,And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,,and this is a classroom today.,What's changed?,The seats are in color.,Whoop-de-do.,Education really hasn't changed,in the past 500 years.,The last big innovation in education,was the printing press and the textbooks.,Everything else has changed around us.,You know, from healthcare to transportation,,everything is different,nbut education hasn't changed. 
 It's also been a real issue in terms of access.,So what you see here,is not a rock concert.,And the person you see at the end of the stage,is not Madonna.,This is a classroom,at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.,Now, we've all heard of distance education,,but the students way in the back,,200 feet away from the instructor,,I think they are undergoing long-distance education.,Now, I really believe,that we can transform education,,both in quality and scale and access,,through technology.,For example, at edX,,we are trying to transform education,through online technologies.,Given education has been calcified for 500 years,,we really cannot think about reengineering it,,micromanaging it.,We really have to completely reimagine it.,It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.,Even the infrastructure has to change.,Everything has to change.,We need to go from lectures on the blackboard,to online exercises, online videos.,We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories,and gamification.,We have to go to completely online grading,and peer interaction and discussion boards.,Everything really has to change. 
 So at edX and a number of other organizations,,we are applying these technologies to education,through MOOCs to reallynincrease access to education.,And you heard of this example,,where, when we launched our very first course --,and this was an MIT-hard,circuits and electronics course --,about a year and a half ago,,155,000 students from 162 countries,enrolled in this course.,And we had no marketing budget.,Now, 155,000 is a big number.,This number is bigger,than the total number of alumni of MIT,in its 150-year history.,7,200 students passed the course,,and this was a hard course.,7,200 is also a big number.,If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,,I would have to teach for 40 years,before I could teach this many students. 
 Now these large numbers,are just one part of the story.,So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,,the other side of MOOCs,,take a different perspective.,We are taking what we developnand learn in the large,and applying it in the small,to the classroom, to createna blended model of learning. 
 But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.,When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,,she stopped speaking English,,and she began speaking this new language.,I call it teen-lish.,It's a digital language.,It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence. 
 "Honey, come over for dinner." 
 "Hmm." 
 "Did you hear me?" 
 Silence. (Laughter) 
 "Can you listen to me?" 
 &quot;Hmm.&quot; 
 So we had a real issue with communicating,,and we were just not communicating,,until one day I had this epiphany.,I texted her. (Laughter),I got an instant response.,I said, no, that must have been by accident.,She must have thought, you know,,some friend of hers was calling her.,So I texted her again. Boom, another response.,I said, this is great.,And so since then, our life has changed.,I text her, she responds.,It's just been absolutely great.,(Applause) 
 So our millennial generation,is built differently.,Now, I'm older, and mynyouthful looks might belie that,,but I'm not in the millennial generation.,But our kids are really different.,The millennial generation is completely comfortable,with online technology.,So why are we fighting it in the classroom?,Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it.,In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,,I can't text very well --,but I'm willing to bet that with evolution,,our kids and their grandchildren,will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs,to text much better,,that evolution will fix all of that stuff.,But what if we embraced technology,,embraced the millennial generation's,natural predilections,,and really think about creatingnthese online technologies,,blend them into their lives.,So here's what we can do.,So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,,herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --,I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,,so why are we forcing our kids to do that?,So instead what you do,is you have them watch videos,and do interactive exercises,in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,,in the dining room, in the bathroom,,wherever they're most creative.,Then they come into the classroom,for some in-person interaction.,They can have discussions amongst themselves.,They can solve problems together.,They can work with the professor,and have the professor answer their questions.,In fact, with edX, when wenwere teaching our first course,on circuits and electronics around the world,,this was happening unbeknownst to us.,Two high school teachers,at the Sant High School in Mongolia,had flipped their classroom,,and they were using our video lectures,and interactive exercises,,where the learners in the high school,,15-year-olds, mind you,,would go and do these things in their own homes,and they would come into class,,and as you see from this image here,,they would interact with each other,and do some physical laboratory work.,And the only way we discovered this,was they wrote a blog,and we happened to stumble upon that blog. 
 We were also doing other pilots.,So we did a pilot experimental blended courses,,working with San Jose State University in California,,again, with the circuits and electronics course.,You'll hear that a lot. That course has become,sort of like our petri dish of learning.,So there, the students would, again,,the instructors flipped the classroom,,blended online and in person,,and the results were staggering.,Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.,Just wait a little bit longer as wenexperiment with this some more,,but the early results are incredible.,So traditionally, semester upon semester,,for the past several years, this course,,again, a hard course,,had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent,every semester.,With this blended class late last year,,the failure rate fell to nine percent.,So the results can be extremely, extremely good. 
 Now before we go too far into this,,I'd like to spend some time discussing,some key ideas.,What are some key ideas,that makes all of this work? 
 One idea is active learning.,The idea here is, rather than have students,walk into class and watch lectures,,we replace this with what we call lessons.,Lessons are interleaved sequences,of videos and interactive exercises.,So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video,and follow that with an interactive exercise.,Think of this as the ultimatenSocratization of education.,You teach by asking questions.,And this is a form of learning,called active learning,,and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,,by Craik and Lockhart,,where they said and discovered,that learning and retention really relates strongly,to the depth of mental processing.,Students learn much better,when they are interacting with the material. 
 The second idea is self-pacing.,Now, when I went to a lecture hall,,and if you were like me,,by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.,I wasn't all that smart, and I wouldnbe scrambling, taking notes,,and then I would lose the lecturenfor the rest of the hour.,Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,,we offer videos and interactivenengagements to students?,They can hit the pause button.,They can rewind the professor.,Heck, they can even mute the professor.,So this form of self-pacing,can be very helpful to learning. 
 The third idea that we have is instant feedback.,With instant feedback,,the computer grades exercises.,I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?,Your computer is grading all the exercises.,And we've all submitted homeworks,,and your grades come back two weeks later,,you've forgotten all about it.,I don't think I've still receivednsome of my homeworks,from my undergraduate days.,Some are never graded.,So with instant feedback,,students can try to apply answers.,If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.,They can try it again and try it again,,and this really becomes much more engaging.,They get the instant feedback,,and this little green check mark that you see here,is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.,Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night,dreaming of the green check mark.,In fact, one of our learners,who took the circuits course early last year,,he then went on to take a software course,from Berkeley at the end of the year,,and this is what the learner had to say,on our discussion board,when he just started that course,about the green check mark:,&quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&quot;,When's the last time you've seen students,posting comments like this about homework?,My colleague Ed Bertschinger,,who heads up the physics department at MIT,,has this to say about instant feedback:,He indicated that instant feedback,turns teaching moments into learning outcomes. 
 The next big idea is gamification.,You know, all learners engage really well,with interactive videos and so on.,You know, they would sit down and shoot,alien spaceships all day long until they get it.,So we applied these gamificationntechniques to learning,,and we can build these online laboratories.,How do you teach creativity?nHow do you teach design?,We can do this through online labs,and use computing power,to build these online labs.,So as this little video shows here,,you can engage students,much like they design with Legos.,So here, the learners are building a circuit,with Lego-like ease.,And this can also be graded by the computer. 
 Fifth is peer learning.,So here, we use discussion forums and discussions,and Facebook-like interaction,not as a distraction,,but to really help students learn.,Let me tell you a story.,When we did our circuits course,for the 155,000 students,,I didn't sleep for three nights,leading up to the launch of the course.,I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,,we're going to be up,monitoring the forum, answering questions.,They had answered questions for 100 students.,How do you do that for 150,000?,So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,,and I think there's this question,from a student from Pakistan,,and he asked a question, and I said,,okay, let me go and type up an answer,,I don't type all that fast,,and I begin typing up the answer,,and before I can finish,,another student from Egyptnpopped in with an answer,,not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,,and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.,had popped in with a different answer.,And then I sat back, fascinated.,Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were,discussing and interacting with each other,,and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,,having this epiphany,,and by 4 a.m. in the morning,,they had discovered the right answer.,And all I had to do was go and bless it,,"Good answer.",So this is absolutely amazing,,where students are learning from each other,,and they're telling us that they are learning,by teaching. 
 Now this is all not just in the future.,This is happening today.,So we are applying these blended learning pilots,in a number of universities and nhigh schools around the world,,from Tsinghua in China,to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia,to Berkeley in California --,all over the world.,And these kinds of technologies really help,,the blended model can really help,revolutionize education.,It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,,the business aspect.,We can also license these MOOC courses,to other universities,,and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,,where the university thatnlicenses it with the professor,can use these online courses,like the next-generation textbook.,They can use as much or as little as they like,,and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal. 
 Finally, I would like to have you,dream with me for a little bit.,I would like us to really reimagine education.,We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.,We have to move from books to tablets,like the Aakash in India,or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.,The Aakash is 40 dollars.,We have to move fromnbricks-and-mortar school buildings,to digital dormitories. 
 But I think at the end of the day,,I think we will still need one lecture hall,in our universities.,Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren,that your grandparents sat in that room,in neat little rows like cornstalks,and watched this professor at the end,talk about content and, you know,,you didn't even have a rewind button? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)When we talk about corruption,,there are typical typesnof individuals that spring to mind.,There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.,Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.,Until his death in 2006,,he was the all-powerfulnleader of Turkmenistan,,a Central Asian countrynrich in natural gas.,Now, he really loved to issuenpresidential decrees.,And one renamed the months of the year,including after himself and his mother.,He spent millions of dollars,creating a bizarre personality cult,,and his crowning glory was the building,of a 40-foot-high gold-platednstatue of himself,which stood proudlynin the capital's central square,and rotated to follow the sun.,He was a slightly unusual guy.,And then there's that cliché,,the African dictatornor minister or official.,There's Teodorín Obiang.,So his daddy is presidentnfor life of Equatorial Guinea,,a West African nation that has exported,billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s,and yet has a truly appallingnhuman rights record.,The vast majority of its people,are living in really miserable poverty,despite an incomenper capita that's on a par,with that of Portugal.,So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself,a $30 million mansionnin Malibu, California.,I've been up to its front gates.,I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.,He bought an €18 million art collection,that used to belong to fashionndesigner Yves Saint Laurent,,a stack of fabulous sports cars,,some costing a million dollars apiece --,oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.,Now get this:,Until recently, he was earningnan official monthly salary,of less than 7,000 dollars.,And there's Dan Etete.,Well, he was the formernoil minister of Nigeria,under President Abacha,,and it just so happensnhe's a convicted money launderer too.,We've spent a great deal of time,investigating a $1 billion --,that's right, a $1 billion —,oil deal that he was involved with,,and what we found was pretty shocking,,but more about that later.,So it's easy to thinknthat corruption happens,somewhere over there,,carried out by a bunch of greedy despots,and individuals up to no good in countries,that we, personally, maynknow very little about,and feel really unconnected to,and unaffected by what might be going on.,But does it just happen over there?,Well, at 22, I was very lucky.,My first job out of university,was investigating the illegalntrade in African ivory.,And that's how my relationshipnwith corruption really began.,In 1993, with two friendsnwho were colleagues,,Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,,we set up an organizationncalled Global Witness.,Our first campaignnwas investigating the role,of illegal logging in fundingnthe war in Cambodia.,So a few years later, and it's now 1997,,and I'm in Angola undercoverninvestigating blood diamonds.,Perhaps you saw the film,,the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,",the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.,Well, some of that sprang from our work.,Luanda, it was full of land mine victims,who were strugglingnto survive on the streets,and war orphans livingnin sewers under the streets,,and a tiny, very wealthy elite,who gossiped about shoppingntrips to Brazil and Portugal.,And it was a slightly crazy place.,So I'm sitting in a hotnand very stuffy hotel room,feeling just totally overwhelmed.,But it wasn't about blood diamonds.,Because I'd been speakingnto lots of people there,who, well, they talkednabout a different problem:,that of a massive webnof corruption on a global scale,and millions of oil dollars going missing.,And for what was thenna very small organization,of just a few people,,trying to even begin to thinknhow we might tackle that,was an enormous challenge.,And in the years that I've been,,and we've all been campaigningnand investigating,,I've repeatedly seennthat what makes corruption,on a global, massive scale possible,,well it isn't just greednor the misuse of power,or that nebulous phrase "weak governance.",I mean, yes, it's all of those,,but corruption, it's madenpossible by the actions,of global facilitators.,So let's go back to some of thosenpeople I talked about earlier.,Now, they're all peoplenwe've investigated,,and they're all people who couldn'tndo what they do alone.,Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up,with high-end art and luxurynhouses without help.,He did business with global banks.,A bank in Paris held accountsnof companies controlled by him,,one of which was used to buy the art,,and American banks, well, they funneled,73 million dollars into the States,,some of which was used to buynthat California mansion.,And he didn't do all of thisnin his own name either.,He used shell companies.,He used one to buynthe property, and another,,which was in somebody else's name,,to pay the huge bills itncost to run the place.,And then there's Dan Etete.,Well, when he was oil minister,,he awarded an oil block nownworth over a billion dollars,to a company that, guess what, yeah,,he was the hidden owner of.,Now, it was then much later traded on,with the kind assistancenof the Nigerian government --,now I have to be careful what I say here —,to subsidiaries of Shellnand the Italian Eni,,two of the biggest oil companies around.,So the reality is,nis that the engine of corruption,,well, it exists farnbeyond the shores of countries,like Equatorial Guineanor Nigeria or Turkmenistan.,This engine, well, it's driven,by our international banking system,,by the problem of anonymousnshell companies,,and by the secrecy that we have afforded,big oil, gas and mining operations,,and, most of all, by the failurenof our politicians,to back up their rhetoric and do something,really meaningful and systemicnto tackle this stuff.,Now let's take the banks first.,Well, it's not goingnto come as any surprise,for me to tell you that banksnaccept dirty money,,but they prioritize their profitsnin other destructive ways too.,For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.,Now this region, it has just five percent,of its forests left intact. Five percent.,So how did that happen?,Well, because an elitenand its facilitators,have been making millions of dollars,from supporting loggingnon an industrial scale,for many years.,So we sent an undercover investigator in,to secretly film meetingsnwith members of the ruling elite,,and the resulting footage, well,nit made some people very angry,,and you can see that on YouTube,,but it proved what we had long suspected,,because it showednhow the state's chief minister,,despite his later denials,,used his control over landnand forest licenses,to enrich himself and his family.,And HSBC, well, we knownthat HSBC bankrolled,the region's largest logging companies,that were responsiblenfor some of that destruction,in Sarawak and elsewhere.,The bank violated its ownnsustainability policies in the process,,but it earned around 130 million dollars.,Now shortly after our exposé,,very shortly after our exposénearlier this year,,the bank announcedna policy review on this.,And is this progress? Maybe,,but we're going to benkeeping a very close eye,on that case.,And then there's the problemnof anonymous shell companies.,Well, we've all heardnabout what they are, I think,,and we all know they're used quite a bit,by people and companiesnwho are trying to avoid,paying their proper dues to society,,also known as taxes.,But what doesn't usually come to light,is how shell companies are used to steal,huge sums of money,ntransformational sums of money,,from poor countries.,In virtually every case of corruptionnthat we've investigated,,shell companies have appeared,,and sometimesnit's been impossible to find out,who is really involved in the deal.,A recent study by the World Bank,looked at 200 cases of corruption.,It found that over 70npercent of those cases,had used anonymous shell companies,,totaling almost 56 billion dollars.,Now many of thesencompanies were in America,or the United Kingdom,,its overseas territoriesnand Crown dependencies,,and so it's not just an offshore problem,,it's an on-shore one too.,You see, shell companies, they're central,to the secret deals which maynbenefit wealthy elites,rather than ordinary citizens.,One striking recent casenthat we've investigated,is how the governmentnin the Democratic Republic of Congo,sold off a series of valuable,nstate-owned mining assets,to shell companiesnin the British Virgin Islands.,So we spoke to sources in country,,trawled through companyndocuments and other information,trying to piece together a reallyntrue picture of the deal.,And we were alarmed to findnthat these shell companies,had quickly flipped many of the assets on,for huge profits to majorninternational mining companies,listed in London.,Now, the Africa ProgressnPanel, led by Kofi Annan,,they've calculatednthat Congo may have lost,more than 1.3 billion dollarsnfrom these deals.,That's almost twice,the country's annual healthnand education budget combined.,And will the people of Congo,nwill they ever get their money back?,Well, the answer to that question,,and who was really involvednand what really happened,,well that's going to probablynremain locked away,in the secretive company registriesnof the British Virgin Islands,and elsewhere unless we all donsomething about it.,And how about the oil, gasnand mining companies?,Okay, maybe it's a bitnof a cliché to talk about them.,Corruption in that sector, no surprise.,There's corruption everywhere,nso why focus on that sector?,Well, because there's a lot at stake.,In 2011, natural resource exports,outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one,in Africa, Asia and Latin America.nNineteen to one.,Now that's a hell of a lotnof schools and universities,and hospitals and business startups,,many of which haven'tnmaterialized and never will,because some of that moneynhas simply been stolen away.,Now let's go back to the oilnand mining companies,,and let's go back to Dan Etetenand that $1 billion deal.,And now forgive me, I'mngoing to read the next bit,because it's a very livenissue, and our lawyers,have been through this in some detail,and they want me to get it right.,Now, on the surface, the dealnappeared straightforward.,Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni,paid the Nigerianngovernment for the block.,The Nigerian government transferred,precisely the same amount,nto the very dollar,,to an account earmarkednfor a shell company,whose hidden owner was Etete.,Now, that's not bad goingnfor a convicted money launderer.,And here's the thing.,After many months of digging around,and reading through hundredsnof pages of court documents,,we found evidence that, in fact,,Shell and Eni had known that the funds,would be transferrednto that shell company,,and frankly, it's hardnto believe they didn't know,who they were really dealing with there.,Now, it just shouldn't takenthese sorts of efforts,to find out where the moneynin deals like this went.,I mean, these are state assets.,They're supposed to benused for the benefit,of the people in the country.,But in some countries,ncitizens and journalists,who are trying to expose stories like this,have been harassed and arrested,and some have even riskedntheir lives to do so.,And finally, well, therenare those who believe,that corruption is unavoidable.,It's just how some business is done.,It's too complex and difficult to change.,So in effect, what? We just accept it.,But as a campaigner and investigator,,I have a different view,,because I've seen what can happen,when an idea gains momentum.,In the oil and mining sector, for example,,there is now the beginning,of a truly worldwide transparency standard,that could tackle some of these problems.,In 1999, when Global Witness called,for oil companies to makenpayments on deals transparent,,well, some people laughednat the extreme naiveté,of that small idea.,But literally hundredsnof civil society groups,from around the world came together,to fight for transparency,,and now it's fast becomingnthe norm and the law.,Two thirds of the value,of the world's oil and mining companies,are now covered by transparency laws.nTwo thirds.,So this is change happening.,This is progress.,But we're not there yet, by far.,Because it really isn't about corruption,somewhere over there, is it?,In a globalized world, corruption,is a truly globalized business,,and one that needs global solutions,,supported and pushed by usnall, as global citizens,,right here.,Thank you.,(Applause)I think we're all aware,that the world today is full of problems.,We've been hearing them,today and yesterday and every day for decades.,Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.,Poor nutrition, access to water,,climate change, deforestation,,lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,,not enough healthcare, pollution.,There's problem after problem,,and I think what really separates this time,from any time I can remember in my brief time,on Earth is the awareness of these problems.,We're all very aware. 
 Why are we having so much trouble,dealing with these problems?,That's the question I've been struggling with,,coming from my very different perspective.,I'm not a social problem guy.,I'm a guy that works with business,,helps business make money.,God forbid.,So why are we having so many problems,with these social problems,,and really is there any role for business,,and if so, what is that role?,I think that in order to address that question,,we have to step back and think about,how we've understood and pondered,both the problems and the solutions,to these great social challenges that we face. 
 Now, I think many have seen business,as the problem, or at least one of the problems,,in many of the social challenges we face.,You know, think of the fast food industry,,the drug industry, the banking industry.,You know, this is a low point,in the respect for business.,Business is not seen as the solution.,It's seen as the problem now, for most people.,And rightly so, in many cases.,There's a lot of bad actors out there,that have done the wrong thing,,that actually have made the problem worse.,So this perspective is perhaps justified. 
 How have we tended to see the solutions,to these social problems,,these many issues that we face in society?,Well, we've tended to see the solutions,in terms of NGOs,,in terms of government,,in terms of philanthropy.,Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity,of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs,and social organizations.,This is a unique, new organizational form,that we've seen grown up.,Enormous innovation, enormous energy,,enormous talent now has been mobilized,through this structure,to try to deal with all of these challenges.,And many of us here are deeply involved in that. 
 I'm a business school professor,,but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.,Whenever I got interested and became aware,of a societal problem, that was what I did,,form a nonprofit.,That was the way we've thought about how to deal,with these issues.,Even a business school professor has thought about it that way. 
 But I think at this moment,,we've been at this for quite a while.,We've been aware of these problems for decades.,We have decades of experience,with our NGOs and with our government entities,,and there's an awkward reality.,The awkward reality is we're not making,fast enough progress.,We're not winning.,These problems still seem very daunting,and very intractable,,and any solutions we're achieving,are small solutions.,We're making incremental progress. 
 What's the fundamental problem we have,in dealing with these social problems?,If we cut all the complexity away,,we have the problem of scale.,We can't scale.,We can make progress. We can show benefits.,We can show results. We can make things better.,We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.,We can't scale.,We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.,Why is that?,Because we don't have the resources.,And that's really clear now.,And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.,There's simply not enough money,to deal with any of these problems at scale,using the current model.,There's not enough tax revenue,,there's not enough philanthropic donations,,to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.,We've got to confront that reality.,And the scarcity of resources,for dealing with these problems is only growing,,certainly in the advanced world today,,with all the fiscal problems we face. 
 So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,,where are the resources in society?,How are those resources really created,,the resources we're going to need to deal,with all these societal challenges?,Well there, I think the answer is very clear:,They're in business.,All wealth is actually created by business.,Business creates wealth,when it meets needs at a profit.,That's how all wealth is created.,It's meeting needs at a profit,that leads to taxes,and that leads to incomes,and that leads to charitable donations.,That's where all the resources come from.,Only business can actually create resources.,Other institutions can utilize them,to do important work,,but only business can create them.,And business creates them,when it's able to meet a need at a profit.,The resources are overwhelmingly,generated by business.,The question then is, how do we tap into this?,How do we tap into this?,Business generates those resources,when it makes a profit.,That profit is that small difference,between the price and the cost it takes to produce,whatever solution business has created,to whatever problem they're trying to solve.,But that profit is the magic.,Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution,we've created,to be infinitely scalable.,Because if we can make a profit,,we can do it for 10, 100, a million,,100 million, a billion.,The solution becomes self-sustaining.,That's what business does,when it makes a profit. 
 Now what does this all have to do,with social problems?,Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit,and redeploy it into social problems.,Business should give more.,Business should be more responsible.,And that's been the path that we've been on,in business.,But again, this path that we've been on,is not getting us where we need to go. 
 Now, I started out as a strategy professor,,and I'm still a strategy professor.,I'm proud of that.,But I've also, over the years,,worked more and more on social issues.,I've worked on healthcare, the environment,,economic development, reducing poverty,,and as I worked more and more in the social field,,I started seeing something,that had a profound impact on me,and my whole life, in a way. 
 The conventional wisdom in economics,and the view in business has historically been,that actually, there's a tradeoff,between social performance and economic performance.,The conventional wisdom has been,that business actually makes a profit,by causing a social problem.,The classic example is pollution.,If business pollutes, it makes more money,than if it tried to reduce that pollution.,Reducing pollution is expensive,,therefore businesses don't want to do it.,It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.,It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,,therefore business makes more money,if they don't have a safe working environment.,That's been the conventional wisdom.,A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.,They resisted environmental improvement.,They resisted workplace improvement.,That thinking has led to, I think,,much of the behavior,that we have come to criticize in business,,that I come to criticize in business. 
 But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,,one after another,,and actually, the more I tried to address them,myself, personally, in a few cases,,through nonprofits that I was involved with,,the more I found actually that the reality,is the opposite.,Business does not profit,from causing social problems,,actually not in any fundamental sense.,That's a very simplistic view.,The deeper we get into these issues,,the more we start to understand,that actually business profits,from solving from social problems.,That's where the real profit comes.,Let's take pollution.,We've learned today that actually,reducing pollution and emissions,is generating profit.,It saves money.,It makes the business more productive and efficient.,It doesn't waste resources.,Having a safer working environment actually,,and avoiding accidents,,it makes the business more profitable,,because it's a sign of good processes.,Accidents are expensive and costly.,Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn,that actually there's no trade-off,between social progress,and economic efficiency,in any fundamental sense.,Another issue is health.,I mean, what we've found is actually,health of employees is something,that business should treasure,,because that health allows those employees,to be more productive and come to work,and not be absent.,The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking,on the interface between business and social problems,is actually showing that there's a fundamental,,deep synergy,,particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.,In the very short run, you can sometimes,fool yourself into thinking,that there's fundamentally opposing goals,,but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning,in field after field that this is simply not true. 
 So how could we tap into,the power of business,to address the fundamental problems,that we face?,Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,,we could scale.,We could tap into this enormous resource pool,and this organizational capacity. 
 And guess what? That's happening now, finally,,partly because of people like you,who have raised these issues now,for year after year and decade after decade.,We see organizations like Dow Chemical,leading the revolution away from trans fat,and saturated fat with innovative new products.,This is an example of Jain Irrigation.,This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology,to thousands and millions of farmers,,reducing substantially the use of water.,We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria,that's figured out how to avoid,tearing down old growth forest,and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield,per hectare of pulp,and making much more paper than you could make,by cutting down those old trees.,You see companies like Cisco that are training,so far four million people in I.T. skills,to actually, yes, be responsible,,but help expand the opportunity,to disseminate I.T. technology,and grow the whole business.,There's a fundamental opportunity for business today,to impact and address these social problems,,and this opportunity,is the largest business opportunity,we see in business. 
 And the question is, how can we get business,thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?,This is what I call shared value:,addressing a social issue with a business model.,That's shared value.,Shared value is capitalism,,but it's a higher kind of capitalism.,It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,,meeting important needs,,not incrementally competing for,trivial differences in product attributes,and market share.,Shared value is when we can create social value,and economic value simultaneously.,It's finding those opportunities,that will unleash the greatest possibility we have,to actually address these social problems,because we can scale.,We can address shared value at multiple levels.,It's real. It's happening. 
 But in order to get this solution working,,we have to now change how business sees itself,,and this is thankfully underway.,Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom,that they shouldn't worry about social problems,,that this was sort of something on the side,,that somebody else was doing it.,We're now seeing companies,embrace this idea.,But we also have to recognize business,is not going to do this as effectively,as if we have NGOs and government,working in partnership with business.,The new NGOs that are really moving the needle,are the ones that have found these partnerships,,that have found these ways to collaborate.,The governments that are making the most progress,are the governments that have found ways,to enable shared value in business,rather than see government as the only player,that has to call the shots.,And government has many ways in which it could impact,the willingness and the ability of companies,to compete in this way. 
 I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,,and if we can get others seeing business differently,,we can change the world.,I know it. I'm seeing it.,I'm feeling it.,Young people, I think,,my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.,If we can break down this sort of divide,,this unease, this tension,,this sense that we're not,fundamentally collaborating here,in driving these social problems,,we can break this down,,and we finally, I think,,can have solutions. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Here's a question we need to rethink together:,What should be the role of money,and markets in our societies? 
 Today, there are very few things,that money can't buy.,If you're sentenced to a jail term,in Santa Barbara, California,,you should know,that if you don't like the standard accommodations,,you can buy a prison cell upgrade.,It's true. For how much, do you think?,What would you guess?,Five hundred dollars?,It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!,Eighty-two dollars a night.,Eighty-two dollars a night.,If you go to an amusement park,and don't want to stand in the long lines,for the popular rides,,there is now a solution.,In many theme parks, you can pay extra,to jump to the head of the line.,They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets. 
 And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.,In Washington, D.C., long lines,,queues sometimes form,for important Congressional hearings.,Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,,maybe overnight, even in the rain.,So now, for lobbyists and others,who are very keen to attend these hearings,but don't like to wait, there are companies,,line-standing companies,,and you can go to them.,You can pay them a certain amount of money,,they hire homeless people and others who need a job,to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,,and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,,can take his or her place at the head of the line,and a seat in the front of the room.,Paid line standing. 
 It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms,and market thinking and market solutions,,in bigger arenas.,Take the way we fight our wars.,Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,,there were more private military contractors on the ground,than there were U.S. military troops?,Now this isn't because we had a public debate,about whether we wanted to outsource war,to private companies,,but this is what has happened. 
 Over the past three decades,,we have lived through a quiet revolution.,We've drifted almost without realizing it,from having a market economy,to becoming market societies.,The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,,a valuable and effective tool,,for organizing productive activity,,but a market society is a place where,almost everything is up for sale.,It's a way of life, in which market thinking,and market values begin to dominate,every aspect of life:,personal relations, family life, health, education,,politics, law, civic life. 
 Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming,market societies?,For two reasons, I think.,One of them has to do with inequality.,The more things money can buy,,the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.,If the only thing that money determined,was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,,then inequality wouldn't matter very much.,But when money comes increasingly to govern,access to the essentials of the good life --,decent health care, access to the best education,,political voice and influence in campaigns --,when money comes to govern all of those things,,inequality matters a great deal.,And so the marketization of everything,sharpens the sting of inequality,and its social and civic consequence.,That's one reason to worry. 
 There's a second reason,apart from the worry about inequality,,and it's this:,with some social goods and practices,,when market thinking and market values enter,,they may change the meaning of those practices,and crowd out attitudes and norms,worth caring about. 
 I'd like to take an example,of a controversial use of a market mechanism,,a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.,Many schools struggle with the challenge,of motivating kids, especially kids,from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,,to do well in school, to apply themselves.,Some economists have proposed a market solution:,Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades,or high test scores,or for reading books.,They've tried this, actually.,They've done some experiments,in some major American cities.,In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,,they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,,35 dollars for a B.,In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers,eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read. 
 So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,,some people are opposed to this cash incentive,to motivate achievement.,Let's see what people here think about it.,Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,,and someone comes to you with this proposal.,And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.,You don't have to take it out of your budget.,How many would be in favor,and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?,Let's see by a show of hands. 
 First, how many think it might at least be worth a try,to see if it would work? Raise your hand. 
 And how many would be opposed? How many would -- 
 So the majority here are opposed,,but a sizable minority are in favor.,Let's have a discussion.,Let's start with those of you who object,,who would rule it out even before trying.,What would be your reason?,Who will get our discussion started? Yes? 
 Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,,and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,,so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,,you just take this incentive away,in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.,Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away. 
 What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation? 
 HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation,should be to learn. 
 MS: To learn.nHM: To get to know the world.,And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?,Then they stop reading? 
 MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,,who thinks it's worth trying this. 
 Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,,and you said worth a try, so why not try it,and do the experiment and measure things?,MS: And measure. And what would you measure?,You'd measure how many --,EL: How many books they read,and how many books they continued to read,after you stopped paying them. 
 MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.,All right, what about that? 
 HM: To be frank, I just think,this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion,is the following question:,Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt,or crowd out the higher motivation,,the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,,which is to learn to love to learn and to read,for their own sakes?,And people disagree about what the effect will be,,but that seems to be the question,,that somehow a market mechanism,or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,,and if it does, what will become of these children later? 
 I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.,The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,,for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.,The two dollars for each book,did lead those kids to read more books.,It also led them to read shorter books. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the real question is,,what will become of these kids later?,Will they have learned that reading is a chore,,a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,,or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially,but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake? 
 Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out,is something that many economists overlook.,Economists often assume,that markets are inert,,that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.,Market exchange, they assume,,doesn't change the meaning or value,of the goods being exchanged.,This may be true enough,if we're talking about material goods.,If you sell me a flat screen television,or give me one as a gift,,it will be the same good.,It will work the same either way.,But the same may not be true,if we're talking about nonmaterial goods,and social practices such as teaching and learning,or engaging together in civic life.,In those domains, bringing market mechanisms,and cash incentives may undermine,or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes,worth caring about.,Once we see,that markets and commerce,,when extended beyond the material domain,,can change the character of the goods themselves,,can change the meaning of the social practices,,as in the example of teaching and learning,,we have to ask where markets belong,and where they don't,,where they may actually undermine,values and attitudes worth caring about.,But to have this debate,,we have to do something we're not very good at,,and that is to reason together in public,about the value and the meaning,of the social practices we prize,,from our bodies to family life,to personal relations to health,to teaching and learning to civic life. 
 Now these are controversial questions,,and so we tend to shrink from them.,In fact, during the past three decades,,when market reasoning and market thinking,have gathered force and gained prestige,,our public discourse during this time,has become hollowed out,,empty of larger moral meaning.,For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.,But once we see that markets,change the character of goods,,we have to debate among ourselves,these bigger questions,about how to value goods. 
 One of the most corrosive effects,of putting a price on everything,is on commonality,,the sense that we are all in it together.,Against the background of rising inequality,,marketizing every aspect of life,leads to a condition where those who are affluent,and those who are of modest means,increasingly live separate lives.,We live and work and shop and play,in different places.,Our children go to different schools. 
 This isn't good for democracy,,nor is it a satisfying way to live,,even for those of us who can afford,to buy our way to the head of the line.,Here's why.,Democracy does not require perfect equality,,but what it does require,is that citizens share in a common life.,What matters is that people,of different social backgrounds,and different walks of life,encounter one another,,bump up against one another,in the ordinary course of life,,because this is what teaches us,to negotiate and to abide our differences.,And this is how we come to care for the common good. 
 And so, in the end, the question of markets,is not mainly an economic question.,It's really a question of how we want to live together.,Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,,or are there certain moral and civic goods,that markets do not honor,and money cannot buy? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I've spent my life working on sustainability.,I set up a climate change NGO,called The Climate Group.,I worked on forestry issues in WWF.,I worked on development and agriculture issues,in the U.N. system.,About 25 years in total,,and then three years ago, I found myself talking to,IKEA's CEO about joining his team.,Like many people here, well,,I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,,so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there. 
 But first, let's just take three numbers. 
 The first number is three:,three billion people.,This is the number of people joining,the global middle class by 2030,,coming out of poverty.,It's fantastic for them and their families,,but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,,and this swells that number to five,,a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity. 
 The second number is six:,This is six degrees centigrade,,what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.,We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees,or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.,And if you think about it, all of the weird weather,we've been having the last few years,,much of that is due to just one degree warming,,and we need CO2 emissions to peak,by the end of this decade globally,and then come down.,It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively. 
 The third number is 12:,That's the number of cities in the world,that had a million or more people,when my grandmother was born.,You can see my grandmother there.,That was in the beginning of the last century.,So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,,the ninth largest city in the world.,Now there are 500 cities, nearly,,with a million people or more in them.,And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,,that's the century when we build all the world's cities,,the century that we're in the middle of right now.,Every other century was kind of practice,,and this lays down a blueprint for how we live. 
 So think about it.,We're building cities like never before,,bringing people out of poverty like never before,,and changing the climate like never before.,Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do,to a must-do.,it's about what we do right here, right now,,and for the rest of our working lives. 
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about,what business can do,and what a business like IKEA can do,,and we have a sustainability strategy,called "people and planet positive",to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.,Why would we not want to have a positive impact,on the world as a business?,Other companies have sustainability strategies.,I'm going to refer to some of those as well,,and I'm just going to mention a few,of the commitments as illustrations that we've got. 
 But first, let's think of customers.,We know from asking people from China to the U.S.,that the vast majority of people care about sustainability,after the day-to-day issues,,the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?,Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?,Then they care about big issues like climate change.,But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,,and they expect business to help,,and they're a little bit disappointed today. 
 So take your mind back and think,of the first sustainable products.,We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.,We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs,that took five minutes to warm up,and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.,And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.,So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,,or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,,or sometimes all three together,,you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.,It wasn't a great start. 
 Today we have choices.,We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,,sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,,functional or useless.,So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,,sustainable products. 
 Let's take the LED.,The LED is the next best thing to daylight.,The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --,I'm not going to ask for a show of hands,of how many of you still have them in your homes,,wasting energy every time you switch them on --,change them after this --,or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --,but those old incandescent light bulbs,really should have been sold as heaters.,They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.,They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.,Now we have lights that produce light,and a little bit of heat on the side.,You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED,that you would have done in an old incandescent.,And the best thing is, they'll also last,for more than 20 years.,So think about that.,You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,,probably more if you're in this audience.,You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.,Your kids could go to school, go to college,,go away and have kids of their own, come back,,bring the grandkids,,you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.,So LEDs are fantastic.,What we decided to do,was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high,and continue to push all the old bulbs,,the halogens and the CFLs.,We decided, over the next two years,,we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.,We will go all in.,And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,,go 100 percent,,because then you stop investing in the old stuff,,you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,,you use your supply chain and your creativity,and you get the prices down so everybody can afford,the best lights so they can save energy. 
 (Applause) 
 It's not just about products in people's homes.,We've got to think about the raw materials,that produce our products.,Obviously there's fantastic opportunities,with recycled materials,,and we can and will go zero waste.,And there's opportunities in a circular economy.,But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.,Let's take cotton.,Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people,are wearing cotton right now.,It's a brilliant textile in use.,It's really dirty in production.,It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.,So we've worked with others,,with other businesses and NGOs,,on the Better Cotton Initiative,,working right back down to the farm,,and there you can halve the amount of water,and halve the chemical inputs,,the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs,of running many of these farms,with farmers with low incomes,can be chemical imports.,Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.,Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.,Already hundreds of thousands of farmers,have been reached,,and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.,Again, we're going all-in.,By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton. 
 Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.,People sometimes think that,100 percent's going to be hard,,and we've had the conversation in the business.,Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do,than 90 percent or 50 percent.,If you have a 90 percent target,,everyone in the business finds a reason,to be in the 10 percent.,When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,,and businesspeople like clarity,,because then you just get the job done. 
 So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.,You've got illegal logging,and deforestation still on a very large scale,,or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry,that we can be proud of.,It's a simple choice, so we've worked,for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,,with literally hundreds of other organizations,,and there's a point here about collaboration.,So hundreds of others, of NGOs,,of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,,have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,,which sets standards for forestry,and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.,Now together, through our supply chain,,with partners, we've managed to certify,35 million hectares of forestry.,That's about the size of Germany.,And we've decided in the next three years,,we will double the volume of certified material,we put through our business.,So be decisive on these issues.,Use your supply chain to drive good. 
 But then it comes to your operations.,Some things are certain, I think.,We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.,We know the sun will be shining somewhere,,and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.,So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?,And why not take control of it ourselves?,So we're going 100 percent renewable.,By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy,than the energy we consume as a business.,For all of our stores, our own factories,,our distribution centers,,we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,,and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate,in six countries, and we're not done yet.,But think of a solar panel.,A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.,The electricity is free.,Every time the sun comes out after that,,the electricity is free.,So this is a good thing for the CFO,,not just the sustainability guy.,Every business can do things like this. 
 But then we've got to look beyond our operations,,and I think everybody would agree,that now business has to take full responsibility,for the impacts of your supply chain.,Many businesses now, fortunately,,have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,,but not every business. Far from it.,And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.,We found there was a risk,of child labor in the supply chain,,and people in the business were shocked.,And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.,So a code of conduct was developed,,and now we have 80 auditors out in the world,every day making sure all our factories,secure good working conditions,and protect human rights,and make sure there is no child labor. 
 But it's not just as simple as making sure,there's no child labor.,You've got to say that's not enough today.,I think we'd all agree that children,are the most important people in the world,and the most vulnerable.,So what can a business do today,to actually use your total value chain,to support a better quality of life,and protect child rights?,We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children,on developing some new business principles,with children's rights.,Increasing numbers of businesses,are signing up to these,,but actually in a survey, many business leaders,said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.,So what we decided to do was, we will look,and ask ourselves the tough questions,with partners who know more than us,,what can we do to go beyond our business,to help improve the lives of children?,We also have a foundation,that's committed to work through partners,and help improve the lives and protect the rights,of 100 million children by 2015. 
 You know the phrase,,you can manage what you measure?,Well, you should measure what you care about.,If you're not measuring things,,you don't care and you don't know.,So let's take an example, measure the things,that are important in your business.,Isn't it about time that businesses,were led equally by men and women? 
 (Applause) 
 So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA,that 47 percent are women today,,but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap,and follow it all the way through to senior management.,And we do not want to wait another hundred years.,So we've launched a women's open network,this week in IKEA,,and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.,So the message here is,,measure what you care about and lead the change,,and don't wait a hundred years. 
 So we've gone from sustainability,being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.,It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.,And everybody can do something on this as an individual.,Be a discerning consumer.,Vote with your wallets.,Search out the companies,that are acting on this.,But also, there are other businesses already acting.,I mentioned renewable energy.,You go to Google or Lego,,they're going 100 percent renewable too,,in the same way that we are.,On having really good sustainability strategies,,there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,,Timberland, Marks & Spencer.,But I don't think any of those businesses would say,they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.,We'll make mistakes going forward,,but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,,having a dialogue with the right partners,,and choosing to lead on the issues that really count. 
 So if you're a business leader,,if you're not already weaving sustainability,right into the heart of your business model,,I'd urge you to do so.,And together, we can help create,a sustainable world,,and, if we get it right,,we can make sustainability,affordable for the many people,,not a luxury for the few. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is an image of the planet Earth.,It looks very much like the Apollo pictures,that are very well known.,There is something different;,you can click on it,,and if you click on it,,you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.,For instance, this is a bird's-eye view,of the EPFL campus.,In many cases, you can also see,how a building looks from a nearby street.,This is pretty amazing.,But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:,It's time.,i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.,I'm not even sure it was taken,at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.,In my lab, we develop tools,to travel not only in space,but also through time.,The kind of question we're asking is,Is it possible to build something,like Google Maps of the past?,Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps,and just change the year,,seeing how it was 100 years before,,1,000 years before?,Is that possible?,Can I reconstruct social networks of the past?,Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?,So, can I build time machines?,Maybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible.",Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.,This is what I call the information mushroom.,Vertically, you have the time.,and horizontally, the amount of digital information available.,Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.,And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.,If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,,or Facebook of the past,,we need to enlarge this space,,we need to make that like a rectangle.,How do we do that?,One way is digitization.,There's a lot of material available --,newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.,I can digitize all these.,I can extract information from these.,Of course, the more you go in the past,nthe less information you will have.,So, it might not be enough.,So, I can do what historians do.,I can extrapolate.,This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.,If I take a log book,,I can consider, it's not just a log book,of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.,I can consider it is actually a log book,which is representative ofnmany journeys of that period.,I'm extrapolating.,If I have a painting of a facade,,I can consider it's not just that particular building,,but probably it also shares the same grammar,of buildings where we lost any information. 
 So if we want to construct a time machine,,we need two things.,We need very large archives,,and we need excellent specialists.,The Venice Time Machine,,the project I'm going to talk to you about,,is a joint project between the EPFL,and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari. 
 There's something very peculiar about Venice,,that its administration has been,very, very bureaucratic.,They've been keeping track of everything,,almost like Google today.,At the Archivio di Stato,,you have 80 kilometers of archives,documenting every aspect,of the life of Venice overnmore than 1,000 years.,You have every boat that goes out,,every boat that comes in.,You have every change that was made in the city.,This is all there.,We are setting up a 10-year digitization program,which has the objective of transforming,this immense archive,into a giant information system.,The type of objective we want to reach,is 450 books a day that can be digitized.,Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough,,because these documents,,most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,,in Venetian dialect,,so you need to transcribe them,,to translate them in some cases,,to index them,,and this is obviously not easy.,In particular, traditional opticalncharacter recognition method,that can be used for printed manuscripts,,they do not work well on the handwritten document.,So the solution is actually to take inspiration,from another domain: speech recognition.,This is a domain of something nthat seems impossible,,which can actually be done,,simply by putting additional constraints.,If you have a very good model,of a language which is used,,if you have a very good model of a document,,how well they are structured.,And these are administrative documents.,They are well structured in many cases.,If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets,where a smaller subsetnactually shares similar features,,then there's a chance of success. 
 If we reach that stage, then there's something else:,we can extract from this document events.,Actually probably 10 billion events,can be extracted from this archive.,And this giant information system,can be searched in many ways.,You can ask questions like,,"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?","How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market,in 1434?","What was the salary,of a glass maker in Murano,maybe over a decade?",You can ask even bigger questions,because it will be semantically coded.,And then what you can do is put that in space,,because much of this information is spatial.,And from that, you can do things like,reconstructing this extraordinary journey,of that city that managed tonhave a sustainable development,over a thousand years,,managing to have all the time,a form of equilibrium with its environment.,You can reconstruct that journey,,visualize it in many different ways.,But of course, you cannot understand nVenice if you just look at the city.,You have to put it in a larger European context.,So the idea is also to document all the things,that worked at the European level.,We can reconstruct also the journey,of the Venetian maritime empire,,how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,,how it became the most powerful medieval empire,of its time,,controlling most of the sea routes,from the east to the south. 
 But you can even do other things,,because in these maritime routes,,there are regular patterns.,You can go one step beyond,and actually create a simulation system,,create a Mediterranean simulator,which is capable actually of reconstructing,even the information we are missing,,which would enable us to have nquestions you could ask,like if you were using a route planner. 
 "If I am in Corfu in June 1323,and want to go to Constantinople,,where can I take a boat?" 
 Probably we can answer this question,with one or two or three days' precision. 
 "How much will it cost?" 
 "What are the chance of encountering pirates?" 
 Of course, you understand,,the central scientific challengenof a project like this one,is qualifying, quantifying and representing,uncertainty and inconsistencynat each step of this process.,There are errors everywhere,,errors in the document, it'snthe wrong name of the captain,,some of the boats never actually took to sea.,There are errors in translation, interpretative biases,,and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,,you're going to have errors in recognition,,errors in extraction,,so you have very, very uncertain data. 
 So how can we detect andncorrect these inconsistencies?,How can we represent that form of uncertainty?,It's difficult. One thing you can do,is document each step of the process,,not only coding the historical information,but what we call the meta-historical information,,how is historical knowledge constructed,,documenting each step.,That will not guarantee that we actually converge,toward a single story of Venice,,but probably we can actually reconstruct,a fully documented potential story of Venice.,Maybe there's not a single map.,Maybe there are several maps.,The system should allow for that,,because we have to deal withna new form of uncertainty,,which is really new for this type of giant databases. 
 And how should we communicate,this new research to a large audience?,Again, Venice is extraordinary for that.,With the millions of visitors that come every year,,it's actually one of the best places,to try to invent the museum of the future.,Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map,of a given year,,and vertically, you see the document,that served the reconstruction,,paintings, for instance.,Imagine an immersive system that permits,to go and dive and reconstructnthe Venice of a given year,,some experience you could share within a group.,On the contrary, imagine actually that you start,from a document, a Venetian manuscript,,and you show, actually, whatnyou can construct out of it,,how it is decoded,,how the context of that document can be recreated.,This is an image from an exhibit,which is currently conducted in Geneva,with that type of system. 
 So to conclude, we can say that,research in the humanities is about to undergo,an evolution which is maybe similar,to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.,It's really a question of scale.,We see projects which are,much beyond any single research team can do,,and this is really new for the humanities,,which very often take the habit of working,in small groups or only with a couple of researchers.,When you visit the Archivio di Stato,,you feel this is beyond what any single team can do,,and that should be a joint and common effort.,So what we must do for this paradigm shift,is actually foster a new generation,of "digital humanists",that are going to be ready for this shift. 
 I thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It's a pleasure to be here,in Edinburgh, Scotland,,the birthplace of the needle and syringe.,Less than a mile from here in this direction,,in 1853 a Scotsman,filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.,His name was Alexander Wood,,and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.,This is the patent.,What blows my mind when I look at it even today,is that it looks almost identical,to the needle in use today.,Yet, it's 160 years old. 
 So we turn to the field of vaccines.,Most vaccines are delivered with,the needle and syringe, nthis 160-year-old technology.,And credit where it's due -- on many levels,,vaccines are a successful technology.,After clean water and sanitation,,vaccines are the one technology that has increased,our life span the most.,That's a pretty hard act to beat. 
 But just like any other technology,,vaccines have their shortcomings,,and the needle and syringe,is a key part within that narrative --,this old technology.,So let's start with the obvious:,Many of us don't like the needle and syringe.,I share that view.,However, 20 percent of the population,have a thing called needle phobia.,That's more than disliking the needle;,that is actively avoiding being vaccinated,because of needle phobia.,And that's problematic in terms nof the rollout of vaccines. 
 Now, related to this is another key issue,,which is needlestick injuries.,And the WHO has figures,that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year,take place due to cross-contamination,with needlestick injuries.,These are early deaths that take place. 
 Now, these are two things that nyou probably may have heard of,,but there are two other shortcomings,of the needle and syringe you nmay not have heard about.,One is it could be holding back,the next generation of vaccines,in terms of their immune responses.,And the second is that it could be responsible,for the problem of the cold chainnthat I'll tell you about as well. 
 I'm going to tell you about some work,that my team and I are doing in Australia,at the University of Queensland,on a technology designed to ntackle those four problems.,And that technology is called the Nanopatch.,Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.,To the naked eye,it just looks like a square,smaller than a postage stamp,,but under a microscope,what you see are thousands of tiny projections,that are invisible to the human eye.,And there's about 4,000 projections,on this particular square compared to the needle.,And I've designed those projections,to serve a key role, which is to nwork with the skin's immune system.,So that's a very important function,tied in with the Nanopatch. 
 Now we make the Nanopatch,with a technique,called deep reactive ion etching.,And this particular technique nis one that's been borrowed,from the semiconductor industry,,and therefore is low cost,and can be rolled out in large numbers. 
 Now we dry-coat vaccines to nthe projections of the Nanopatch,and apply it to the skin.,Now, the simplest form of application,is using our finger,,but our finger has some limitations,,so we've devised an applicator.,And it's a very simple device --,you could call it a sophisticated finger.,It's a spring-operated device.,What we do is when we apply nthe Nanopatch to the skin as so --,(Click) --,immediately a few things happen.,So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch,breach through the tough outer layer,and the vaccine is very quickly released --,within less than a minute, in fact.,Then we can take the Nanopatch off,and discard it.,And indeed we can make na reuse of the applicator itself. 
 So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,,and immediately you can see some key advantages.,We've talked about it being needle-free --,these are projections that you can't even see --,and, of course, we get around,the needle phobia issue as well. 
 Now, if we take a step back and think about,these other two really important advantages:,One is improved immune nresponses through delivery,,and the second is getting rid of the cold chain. 
 So let's start with the first one, nthis immunogenicity idea.,It takes a little while to get our heads around,,but I'll try to explain it in simple terms.,So I'll take a step back and explain to you,how vaccines work in a simple way.,So vaccines work by introducing into our body,a thing called an antigen,which is a safe form of a germ.,Now that safe germ, that antigen,,tricks our body into mounting an immune response,,learning and remembering nhow to deal with intruders.,When the real intruder comes along,the body quickly mounts an immune response,to deal with that vaccine,and neutralizes the infection.,So it does that well. 
 Now, the way it's done today nwith the needle and syringe,,most vaccines are delivered that way --,with this old technology and the needle.,But it could be argued that the needle nis holding back our immune responses;,it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.,To describe this idea,,we need to take a journey through the skin,,starting with one of those projections,and applying the Nanopatch to the skin.,And we see this kind of data.,Now, this is real data --,that thing that we can see there is one projection,from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin,and those colors are different layers.,Now, to give you an idea of scale,,if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.,It would be 10 times bigger,than the size of that screen,ngoing 10 times deeper as well.,It's off the grid entirely.,You can see immediately that we nhave those projections in the skin.,That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,,but the brown layer and the magenta layer,are jammed full of immune cells.,As one example, in the brown layer,there's a certain type of cell ncalled a Langerhans cell --,every square millimeter of our body,is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,,those immune cells, and nthere's others shown as well,that we haven't stained in this image.,But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch,achieves that penetration indeed.,We target thousands upon thousands nof these particular cells,just residing within a hair's width,of the surface of the skin. 
 Now, as the guy that's inventednthis thing and designed it to do that,,I found that exciting. But so what?,So what if you've targeted cells?,In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?,The world of vaccines is getting better.,It's getting more systematic.,However, you still don't really know,if a vaccine is going to work,until you roll your sleeves up,and vaccinate and wait.,It's a gambler's game even today. 
 So, we had to do that gamble.,We obtained an influenza vaccine,,we applied it to our Nanopatches,and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,,and we waited --,and this is in the live animal.,We waited a month,,and this is what we found out.,This is a data slide showing the immune responses,that we've generated with a Nanopatch,compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.,So on the horizontal axis we have nthe dose shown in nanograms.,On the vertical axis we have nthe immune response generated,,and that dashed line indicates nthe protection threshold.,If we're above that line it's considered protective;,if we're below that line it's not.,So the red line is mostly below that curve,and indeed there's only one point that nis achieved with the needle that's protective,,and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.,But notice immediately the distinctly different curve,that we achieve with the blue line.,That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;,the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is,a completely different immunogenicity curve.,That's a real fresh opportunity.,Suddenly we have a brand new lever,in the world of vaccines.,We can push it one way,,where we can take a vaccine nthat works but is too expensive,and can get protection,with a hundredth of the dose ncompared to the needle.,That can take a vaccine that's suddenly n10 dollars down to 10 cents,,and that's particularly important nwithin the developing world. 
 But there's another angle to this as well --,you can take vaccines that currently don't work,and get them over that line,and get them protective.,And certainly in the world of vaccines,that can be important.,Let's consider the big three:,HIV, malaria, tuberculosis.,They're responsible for about n7 million deaths per year,,and there is no adequate vaccination nmethod for any of those.,So potentially, with this new lever nthat we have with the Nanopatch,,we can help make that happen.,We can push that lever to help get those ncandidate vaccines over the line.,Now, of course, we've worked within my lab,with many other vaccines that have attained,similar responses and similar curves to this,,what we've achieved with influenza. 
 I'd like to now switch to talk about,another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,,and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.,As the name suggests -- the cold chain --,it's the requirements of keeping na vaccine right from production,all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,,to keep it refrigerated.,Now, that presents some logistical challenges,but we have ways to do it.,This is a slightly extreme case in point,but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,,in particular in resource-poor settings,,of what's required to get vaccines,refrigerated and maintain the cold chain.,If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,,but interestingly it can be too cold,and the vaccine can break down as well. 
 Now, the stakes are very high.,The WHO estimates that within Africa,,up to half the vaccines used there,are considered to not be working properly,because at some point the ncold chain has fallen over.,So it's a big problem, and it's tied nin with the needle and syringe,because it's a liquid form vaccine, and nwhen it's liquid it needs the refrigeration. 
 A key attribute of our Nanopatch,is that the vaccine is dry,,and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.,Within my lab we've shown that we can keep,the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius,for more than a year without nany loss in activity at all.,That's an important improvement.,(Applause),We're delighted about it as well.,And the thing about it is thatnwe have well and truly proven,the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.,And as a scientist, I love that and I love science.,However, as an engineer,,as a biomedical engineer,and also as a human being,,I'm not going to be satisfied,until we've rolled this thing nout, taken it out of the lab,and got it to people in large numbers,and particularly the people that need it the most. 
 So we've commenced this particular journey,,and we've commenced this njourney in an unusual way.,We've started with Papua New Guinea. 
 Now, Papua New Guinea is an example nof a developing world country.,It's about the same size as France,,but it suffers from many of the key barriers,existing within the world of today's vaccines.,There's the logistics:,Within this country there are only 800 nrefrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.,Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,nmany of them are breaking down,and many are not in the Highlands nwhere they are required.,That's a challenge.,But also, Papua New Guinea has the nworld's highest incidence of HPV,,human papillomavirus, the ncervical cancer [risk factor].,Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers,because it's too expensive.,So for those two reasons, with nthe attributes of the Nanopatch,,we've got into the field and nworked with the Nanopatch,,and taken it to Papua New Guinea,and we'll be following that up shortly. 
 Now, doing this kind of work is not easy.,It's challenging,,but there's nothing else in nthe world I'd rather be doing.,And as we look ahead,I'd like to share with you a thought:,It's the thought of a future where,the 17 million deaths per year,that we currently have due to infectious disease,is a historical footnote.,And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved,by improved, radically improved vaccines.,Now standing here today in front of you,at the birthplace of the needle and syringe,,a device that's 160 years old,,I'm presenting to you an alternative approach,that could really help make that happen --,and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes nof being needle-free, pain-free,,the ability for removing the cold chainnand improving the immunogenicity.,Thank you.,(Applause)I'd like to start, if I may,,with the story of the Paisley snail.,On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,,May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow,to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,,and there at the Wellmeadow Café,,she had a Scots ice cream float,,a mix of ice cream and ginger beer,bought for her by a friend.,The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle,labeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley.",She drank some of the ice cream float,,but as the remaining ginger beer was poured,into her tumbler,,a decomposed snail,floated to the surface of her glass.,Three days later, she was admitted,to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary,and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis,and shock. 
 The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed,set a very important legal precedent:,Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,,was held to have a clear duty of care,towards May Donoghue,,even though there was no contract between them,,and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.,One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:,You must take care to avoid acts or omissions,which you can reasonably foresee,would be likely to injure your neighbor.,Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,,how many people would have had to suffer,from gastroenteritis before Stevensonneventually went out of business. 
 Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,,because it's an important principle.,Last year, the Hansard Society,na nonpartisan charity,which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy,and encourage greater public involvement in politics,published, alongside their annual audit,of political engagement, an additional section,devoted entirely to politics and the media.,Here are a couple of rather depressing observations,from that survey.,Tabloid newspapers do not appear,to advance the political citizenship of their readers,,relative even to those,who read no newspapers whatsoever.,Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree,with a negative view of politics,than readers of no newspapers.,They're not just less politically engaged.,They are consuming media that reinforces,their negative evaluation of politics,,thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical,attitude to democracy and their own role within it.,Little wonder that the report concluded that,in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,,appear not to be living up to the importance,of their role in our democracy. 
 Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously,challenge that view.,But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,,then we've got a very serious problem on our hands,,and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes,focusing upon. 
 Since the Paisley snail,,and especially over the past decade or so,,a great deal of thinking has been developed,around the notion of a duty of care,as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.,Generally a duty of care arises when one individual,or a group of individuals undertakes an activity,which has the potential to cause harm to another,,either physically, mentally or economically.,This is principally focused on obvious areas,,such as our empathetic responsento children and young people,,to our service personnel, andnto the elderly and infirm.,It is seldom, if ever, extendednto equally important arguments,around the fragility of ournpresent system of government,,to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality,are fundamental to the process of building,and embedding an informed,,participatory democracy.,And the more you think about it,,the stranger that is. 
 A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure,of opening a brand new school,in the northeast of England.,It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.,As I walked through their impressive,,glass-covered atrium,,in front of me, emblazoned on the wall,in letters of fire,was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:,If it's not true, don't say it;,if it's not right, don't do it.,The head teacher saw me staring at it,,and he said, "Oh, that's our school motto.",On the train back to London,,I couldn't get it out of my mind.,I kept thinking, can it really have taken us,over 2,000 years to come to terms,with that simple notion,as being our minimum expectation of each other?,Isn't it time that we develop this concept,of a duty of care,and extended it to include a care,for our shared but increasinglynendangered democratic values?,After all, the absence of a duty of care,within many professions,can all too easily amount tonaccusations of negligence,,and that being the case, can we benreally comfortable with the thought,that we're in effect being negligent,in respect of the health of our own societies,and the values that necessarily underpin them?,Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,,that the same media whichnHansard so roundly condemned,have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving,in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen,would be likely to undermine or even damage,our inherently fragile democratic settlement. 
 Now there will be those who will argue,that this could all too easily drift into a form,of censorship, albeit self-censorship,,but I don't buy that argument.,It has to be possible,to balance freedom of expression,with wider moral and social responsibilities. 
 Let me explain why by taking the example,from my own career as a filmmaker.,Throughout that career, I never accepted,that a filmmaker should set about putting,their own work outside or above what he or she,believed to be a decent set of values,for their own life, their own family,,and the future of the society in which we all live.,I'd go further.,A responsible filmmaker shouldnnever devalue their work,to a point at which it becomes less than true,to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.,As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers,are all required to face up to the social expectations,that come with combining thenintrinsic power of their medium,with their well-honed professional skills.,Obviously this is not a mandated duty,,but for the gifted filmmakernand the responsible journalist,or even blogger, it strikes menas being utterly inescapable. 
 We should always remember that our notion,of individual freedom andnits partner, creative freedom,,is comparatively new,in the history of Western ideas,,and for that reason, it's often undervalued,and can be very quickly undermined.,It's a prize easily lost,,and once lost, once surrendered,,it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.,And its first line of defense,has to be our own standards,,not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,,our own standards and our own integrity.,Our integrity as we deal with those,with whom we work,and our own standards as we operate within society.,And these standards of ours,need to be all of a piece withna sustainable social agenda.,They're part of a collective responsibility,,the responsibility of the artist or the journalist,to deal with the world as it really is,,and this, in turn, must go hand in hand,with the responsibility of those governing society,to also face up to that world,,and not to be tempted to misappropriate,the causes of its ills.,Yet, as has become strikingly clear,over the last couple of years,,such responsibility has to a very great extent,been abrogated by large sections of the media.,And as a consequence, across the Western world,,the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest,and their appeal to a largely disillusioned,,older demographic,,along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial,that typifies at least some of the young,,taken together, these and other similarly,contemporary aberrations,are threatening to squeeze the life,out of active, informed debate and engagement,,and I stress active. 
 The most ardent of libertarians might argue,that Donoghue v. Stevenson shouldnhave been thrown out of court,and that Stevenson would eventuallynhave gone out of business,if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.,But most of us, I think, accept some small role,for the state to enforce a duty of care,,and the key word here is reasonable.,Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care,and could they have reasonably foreseen,the consequences of their actions?,Far from signifying overbearing state power,,it's that small common sense test of reasonableness,that I'd like us to apply to those in the media,who, after all, set the tone and the content,for much of our democratic discourse. 
 Democracy, in order to work, requires that,reasonable men and women takenthe time to understand and debate,difficult, sometimes complex issues,,and they do so in an atmosphere which strives,for the type of understanding that leads to,,if not agreement, then at least a productive,and workable compromise.,Politics is about choices,,and within those choices, politics is about priorities.,It's about reconciling conflicting preferences,wherever and whenever possibly based on fact.,But if the facts themselves are distorted,,the resolutions are likely onlynto create further conflict,,with all the stresses and strains on society,that inevitably follow.,The media have to decide:,Do they see their role as being to inflame,or to inform?,Because in the end, it comes down to a combination,of trust and leadership. 
 Fifty years ago this week,nPresident John F. Kennedy,made two epoch-making speeches,,the first on disarmamentnand the second on civil rights.,The first led almost immediately,to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,,and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,,both of which represented giant leaps forward.,Democracy, well-led and well-informed,,can achieve very great things,,but there's a precondition.,We have to trust that those making those decisions,are acting in the best interest not of themselves,but of the whole of the people.,We need factually-based options,,clearly laid out,,not those of a few powerful,and potentially manipulative corporations,pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,,but accurate, unprejudiced information,with which to make our own judgments.,If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives,for our children and our children's children,,we need to exercise to thenvery greatest degree possible,that duty of care for a vibrant,,and hopefully a lasting, democracy.,Thank you very much for listening to me.,(Applause)Where do you come from?,It's such a simple question,,but these days, of course,nsimple questions,bring ever more complicated answers. 
 People are always askingnme where I come from,,and they're expecting me to say India,,and they're absolutely rightninsofar as 100 percent,of my blood and ancestryndoes come from India.,Except, I've never livednone day of my life there.,I can't speak even one word,of its more than 22,000 dialects.,So I don't think I've reallynearned the right,to call myself an Indian.,And if "Where do you come from?",means "Where were you bornnand raised and educated?",then I'm entirelynof that funny little country,known as England,,except I left Englandnas soon as I completed,my undergraduate education,,and all the time I was growing up,,I was the only kid in all my classes,who didn't begin to looknlike the classic English heroes,represented in our textbooks.,And if "Where do you come from?",means "Where do you pay your taxes?,Where do you see your doctornand your dentist?",then I'm very much of the United States,,and I have been for 48 years now,,since I was a really small child.,Except, for many of those years,,I've had to carry around thisnfunny little pink card,with green lines running through my face,identifying me as a permanent alien.,I do actually feel more aliennthe longer I live there. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if "Where do you come from?",means "Which place goes deepest inside you,and where do you trynto spend most of your time?",then I'm Japanese,,because I've been living as much as I can,for the last 25 years in Japan.,Except, all of those yearsnI've been there on a tourist visa,,and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese,would want to consider me one of them. 
 And I say all this just to stress,how very old-fashioned and straightforward,my background is,,because when I go to HongnKong or Sydney or Vancouver,,most of the kids I meet,are much more internationalnand multi-cultured than I am.,And they have one homenassociated with their parents,,but another associatednwith their partners,,a third connected maybe with the placenwhere they happen to be,,a fourth connected with the placenthey dream of being,,and many more besides.,And their whole life will benspent taking pieces,of many different placesnand putting them together,into a stained glass whole.,Home for them is reallyna work in progress.,It's like a projectnon which they're constantly adding,upgrades and improvements and corrections.,And for more and more of us,,home has really less to donwith a piece of soil,than, you could say, with a piece of soul. 
 If somebody suddenly asksnme, "Where's your home?",I think about my sweetheartnor my closest friends,or the songs that travel with menwherever I happen to be.,And I'd always felt this way,,but it really came home to me, as it were,,some years ago whennI was climbing up the stairs,in my parents' house in California,,and I looked through the livingnroom windows,and I saw that we werenencircled by 70-foot flames,,one of those wildfiresnthat regularly tear through,the hills of Californianand many other such places.,And three hours later,nthat fire had reduced,my home and every last thing in it,except for me to ash.,And when I woke up the next morning,,I was sleeping on a friend's floor,,the only thing I hadnin the world was a toothbrush,I had just boughtnfrom an all-night supermarket.,Of course, if anybody asked me then,,"Where is your home?",I literally couldn't pointnto any physical construction.,My home would have to be whatevernI carried around inside me. 
 And in so many ways, I thinknthis is a terrific liberation.,Because when my grandparents were born,,they pretty much had their sense of home,,their sense of community,neven their sense of enmity,,assigned to them at birth,,and didn't have much chancenof stepping outside of that.,And nowadays, at least some of usncan choose our sense of home,,create our sense of community,,fashion our sense of self, and in so doing,maybe step a little beyond,some of the black and white divisions,of our grandparents' age.,No coincidence that the president,of the strongest nationnon Earth is half-Kenyan,,partly raised in Indonesia,,has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law. 
 The number of people livingnin countries not their own,now comes to 220 million,,and that's an almost unimaginable number,,but it means that if you tooknthe whole population of Canada,and the whole population of Australia,and then the whole populationnof Australia again,and the whole population of Canada again,and doubled that number,,you would still havenfewer people than belong,to this great floating tribe. 
 And the number of us who live outside,the old nation-state categoriesnis increasing so quickly,,by 64 million just in the last 12 years,,that soon there will be morenof us than there are Americans.,Already, we representnthe fifth-largest nation on Earth.,And in fact, in Canada's largestncity, Toronto,,the average resident todaynis what used to be called,a foreigner, somebody bornnin a very different country. 
 And I've always felt that the beautynof being surrounded by the foreign,is that it slaps you awake.,You can't take anything for granted.,Travel, for me, is a little bitnlike being in love,,because suddenly all your sensesnare at the setting marked "on.",Suddenly you're alert to the secretnpatterns of the world.,The real voyage of discovery,nas Marcel Proust famously said,,consists not in seeing new sights,,but in looking with new eyes.,And of course, once you have new eyes,,even the old sights, even your home,become something different.,Many of the people livingnin countries not their own,are refugees who nevernwanted to leave home,and ache to go back home.,But for the fortunate among us,,I think the age of movement bringsnexhilarating new possibilities. 
 Certainly when I'm traveling,,especially to the majorncities of the world,,the typical person I meet today,will be, let's say, a half-Korean,nhalf-German young woman,living in Paris.,And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,,half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,,she recognizes him as kin.,She realizes that she probablynhas much more in common with him,than with anybody entirelynof Korea or entirely of Germany.,So they become friends. They fall in love.,They move to New York City. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or Edinburgh.,And the little girlnwho arises out of their union,will of course be not Korean or German,or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian,or even American, but a wonderful,and constantly evolvingnmix of all those places.,And potentially, everything about the way,that young woman dreams about the world,,writes about the world,nthinks about the world,,could be something different,,because it comes out of thisnalmost unprecedented,blend of cultures. 
 Where you come from nownis much less important,than where you're going.,More and more of usnare rooted in the future,or the present tensenas much as in the past.,And home, we know, is not just the place,where you happen to be born.,It's the place where you become yourself. 
 And yet,,there is one great problem with movement,,and that is that it's reallynhard to get your bearings,when you're in midair.,Some years ago, I noticednthat I had accumulated,one million milesnon United Airlines alone.,You all know that crazy system,,six days in hell, you getnthe seventh day free. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I began to think that really,,movement was only as goodnas the sense of stillness,that you could bring to itnto put it into perspective. 
 And eight monthsnafter my house burned down,,I ran into a friend who taughtnat a local high school,,and he said, "I've gotnthe perfect place for you.","Really?" I said. I'mnalways a bit skeptical,when people say things like that.,"No, honestly," he went on,,"it's only three hours away by car,,and it's not very expensive,,and it's probably not like anywherenyou've stayed before.","Hmm." I was beginning to getnslightly intrigued. "What is it?","Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —,"Well, actuallynit's a Catholic hermitage.",This was the wrong answer.,I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,,so I had had enough hymnalsnand crosses to last me a lifetime.,Several lifetimes, actually.,But my friend assured menthat he wasn't Catholic,,nor were most of his students,,but he took his classesnthere every spring.,And as he had it,neven the most restless, distractible,,testosterone-addledn15-year-old Californian boy,only had to spend three days in silence,and something in him cooledndown and cleared out.,He found himself.,And I thought, "Anythingnthat works for a 15-year-old boy,ought to work for me." 
 So I got in my car,nand I drove three hours north,along the coast,,and the roads grew emptier and narrower,,and then I turnednonto an even narrower path,,barely paved, that snaked for two miles,up to the top of a mountain.,And when I got out of my car,,the air was pulsing.,The whole place was absolutely silent,,but the silence wasn'tnan absence of noise.,It was really a presence of a kindnof energy or quickening.,And at my feet was the great,nstill blue plate,of the Pacific Ocean.,All around me were 800nacres of wild dry brush. 
 And I went down to the roomnin which I was to be sleeping.,Small but eminently comfortable,,it had a bed and a rocking chair,and a long desk and even longernpicture windows,looking out on a small,nprivate, walled garden,,and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass,running down to the sea.,And I sat down, and I began to write,,and write, and write,,even though I'd gone therenreally to get away from my desk.,And by the time I got up,nfour hours had passed.,Night had fallen,,and I went out under this greatnoverturned saltshaker of stars,,and I could see the tail lights of cars,disappearing around the headlandsn12 miles to the south.,And it really seemednlike my concerns of the previous day,vanishing.,And the next day, when I woke up,in the absence of telephonesnand TVs and laptops,,the days seemed to stretchnfor a thousand hours.,It was really all the freedomnI know when I'm traveling,,but it also profoundlynfelt like coming home.,And I'm not a religious person,,so I didn't go to the services.,I didn't consult the monks for guidance.,I just took walks along the monastery road,and sent postcards to loved ones.,I looked at the clouds,,and I did what is hardestnof all for me to do usually,,which is nothing at all. 
 And I started to go back to this place,,and I noticed that I was doingnmy most important work there,invisibly just by sitting still,,and certainly comingnto my most critical decisions,the way I never could when I was racing,from the last emailnto the next appointment.,And I began to think that something in me,had really been crying out for stillness,,but of course I couldn't hear it,because I was running around so much.,I was like some crazy guynwho puts on a blindfold,and then complainsnthat he can't see a thing. 
 And I thought backnto that wonderful phrase,I had learned as a boy from Seneca,,in which he says, "That man is poor,not who has little but who hankersnafter more.",And, of course, I'm not suggesting,that anybody here go into a monastery.,That's not the point.,But I do thinknit's only by stopping movement,that you can see where to go.,And it's only by steppingnout of your life and the world,that you can see what younmost deeply care about,and find a home. 
 And I've noticed so many people now,take conscious measuresnto sit quietly for 30 minutes,every morning just collecting themselves,in one corner of the roomnwithout their devices,,or go running every evening,,or leave their cell phones behind,when they go to have a longnconversation with a friend.,Movement is a fantastic privilege,,and it allows us to do sonmuch that our grandparents,could never have dreamed of doing.,But movement, ultimately,,only has a meaning if younhave a home to go back to. 
 And home, in the end, is of course,not just the place where you sleep.,It's the place where you stand. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I read poetry all the time,and write about it frequently,and take poems apart,to see how they work,because I'm a word person.,I understand the world best, most fully,,in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,,and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,,I'm a little frustrated,until I can try to put it into words.,I think I've always been that way.,I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.,And I found poems by Andrew Marvell,and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson,and William Butler Yeats,because they were quoted in science fiction,,and I loved their sounds,and I went on to read about ottava rima,and medial caesuras and enjambment,and all that other technical stuff,that you care about if you already care about poems,,because poems already made me happier,and sadder and more alive.,And I became a poetry critic,because I wanted to know how and why. 
 Now, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose,any more than music or computer programming,serve one purpose.,The greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,",and poetry is a set of techniques,,ways of making patterns,that put emotions into words.,The more techniques you know,,the more things you can make,,and the more patterns you can recognize,in things you might already like or love. 
 That said, poetry does seem to be,especially good at certain things.,For example, we are all going to die.,Poetry can help us live with that.,Poems are made of words, nothing but words.,The particulars in poems are like,the particularities, the personalities,,that distinguish people from one another.,Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on,,and when you read a poem, you can imagine,someone's speaking to you or for you,,maybe even someone far away,or someone made up or someone deceased.,That's why we can go to poems when we want to,remember something or someone,,to celebrate or to look beyond death,or to say goodbye,,and that's one reason poems can seem important,,even to people who aren't me,,who don't so much live in a world of words.,The poet Frank O'Hara said,,"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,",but he also said when he didn'tnwant to be alive anymore,,the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems,had stopped him.,Poetry helps me want to be alive,,and I want to show you why by showing you how,,how a couple of poems react to the fact that,we're alive in one place at one time in one culture,,and in another we won't be alive at all. 
 So here's one of the first poems I memorized.,It could address a child or an adult. 
 "From far, from eve and morning 
 From yon twelve-winded sky, 
 The stuff of life to knit me 
 Blew hither; here am I. 
 Now — for a breath I tarry 
 Nor yet disperse apart — 
 Take my hand quick and tell me, 
 What have you in your heart. 
 Speak now, and I will answer; 
 How shall I help you, say; 
 Ere to the wind's twelve quarters 
 I take my endless way." 
 [A. E. Housman] 
 Now, this poem has appealed,to science fiction writers.,It's furnished at least three science fiction titles,,I think because it says poems can brings us news,from the future or the past,or across the world,,because their patterns can seem to tell you,what's in somebody's heart.,It says poems can bring people together temporarily,,which I think is true,,and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes,but for how it rhymes,,cleanly and simply on the two and four,,"say" and "way,",with anticipatory hints on the one and three,,"answer" and "quarters,",as if the poem itself were coming together.,It plays up the fact that we die,by exaggerating the speed of our lives.,A few years on Earth become,one speech, one breath.,It's a poem about loneliness --,the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last —,and it might look like a plea for help,'til you get to the word "help,",where this "I" facing you, taking your hand,,is more like a teacher or a genie,,or at least that's what he wants to believe.,It would not be the first time a poet had,written the poem that he wanted to hear. 
 Now, this next poem really changed,what I liked and what I read,and what I felt I could read as an adult.,It might not make any sense to you,if you haven't seen it before. 
 "The Garden" 
 "Oleander: coral 
 from lipstick ads in the 50's. 
 Fruit of the tree of such knowledge 
 To smackn(thin air) 
 meaning kiss or hit. 
 It appears 
 in the guise of outworn usages 
 because we are bad? 
 Big masculine threat, 
 insinuating and slangy." 
 [Rae Armantrout] 
 Now, I found this poem in an anthology,of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.,I just heard that there were these scandalous writers,called Language poets who didn't make any sense,,and I wanted to go and seenfor myself what they were like,,and some of them didn't do much for me,,but this writer, Rae Armantrout,,did an awful lot, and I kept reading her,until I felt I knew what was going on,,as I do with this poem. 
 It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall,and the Biblical story of the Fall,,in which sex as we know it,and death and guilt,come into the world at the same time.,It's also about how appearances deceive,,how our culture can sweep us along,into doing and saying things we didn't intend,or don't like, and Armantrout's style,is trying to help us stop or slow down.,"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,,as in lip-smacking,,but that can lead to "smack" as in "hit",as in domestic abuse,,because sexual attraction can seem threatening.,The red that means fertility,can also mean poison.,Oleander is poisonous.,And outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss",or "hit" can help us see,how our unacknowledged assumptions,can make us believe we are bad,,either because sex is sinful,or because we tolerate so much sexism.,We let guys tell women what to do.,The poem reacts to old lipstick ads,,and its edginess about statement,,its reversals and halts, have everything to do,with resisting the language of ads,that want to tell us so easily what to want,,what to do, what to think.,That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,,which shows me, Armantrout shows me,what it's like to hear grave threats,and mortal dishonesty in the language,of everyday life, and once she's done that,,I think she can show other people, women and men,,what it's like to feel that way,and say to other people, women and men,who feel so alienated or so threatened,that they're not alone. 
 Now, how do I know that I'm right,about this somewhat confusing poem?,Well in this case, I emailednthe poet a draft of my talk,and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it.",Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause),But usually, you can't know. You never know.,You can't be sure, and that's okay.,All we can do we is listen to poems,and look at poems and guess,and see if they can bring us what we need,,and if you're wrong about some part of a poem,,nothing bad will happen.,Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,,but a little younger than A. E. Housman's. 
 "The Brave Man" 
 "The sun, that brave man, 
 Comes through boughs that lie in wait, 
 That brave man. 
 Green and gloomy eyes 
 In dark forms of the grass 
 Run away. 
 The good stars, 
 Pale helms and spiky spurs, 
 Run away. 
 Fears of my bed, 
 Fears of life and fears of death, 
 Run away. 
 That brave man comes up 
 From below and walks without meditation, 
 That brave man." 
 [Wallace Stevens] 
 Now, the sun in this poem,,in Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave,because the person in the poem is so afraid.,The sun comes up in the morning through branches,,dispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,,and defeats stars envisioned as armies.,"Brave" has its old sense of showy,as well as its modern sense, courage.,This sun is not afraid to show his face.,But the person in the poem is afraid.,He might have been up all night.,That is the reveal Stevensnsaves for that fourth stanza,,where run away has become a refrain.,This person might want to run away too,,but fortified by the sun's example,,he might just rise.,Stevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation",for the end.,Unlike the sun, human beings think.,We meditate on past and future, life and death,,above and below.,And it can make us afraid. 
 Poems, the patterns in poems,,show us not just what somebody thought,or what someone did or what happened,but what it was like to be a person like that,,to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,,so goofy, so preposterous, so brave.,That's why poems can seem at once so durable,,so personal, and so ephemeral,,like something inside and outside you at once.,The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry,to a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,,and the American poet Terrance Hayes,wrote six poems called "Wind in a Box.",One of them asks, "Tell me,,what am I going to do when I'm dead?",And the answer is that he'll stay with us,or won't stay with us inside us as wind,,as air, as words. 
 It is easier than ever to find poems,that might stay inside you, that might stay with you,,from long, long ago, or from right this minute,,from far away or from right close to where you live,,almost no matter where you live.,Poems can help you say, helpnyou show how you're feeling,,but they can also introduce you,to feelings, ways of being in the world,,people, very much unlike you,,maybe even people from long, long ago.,Some poems even tell you,that that is what they can do.,That's what John Keats is doing,in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.,It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,,he probably left it unfinished,,and because it might be meant,for a character in a play,,but it might just be Keats' thinking,about what his own writing,,his handwriting, could do,,and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,,and I hear the power of older poetic techniques,,and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,,of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,,someone else from long ago,,someone quite memorable. 
 "This living hand, now warm and capable 
 Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold 
 And in the icy silence of the tomb, 
 So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights 
 That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood 
 So in my veins red life might stream again, 
 And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is -- 
 I hold it towards you." 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,,and it comes in part from a deep dilemma,in which it is embedded.,It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions,we face that have to do with global pandemics,,a cross-border problem;,with HIV, a transnational problem;,with markets and immigration,,something that goes beyond national borders;,with terrorism, with war,,all now cross-border problems. 
 In fact, we live in a 21st-century world,of interdependence,,and brutal interdependent problems,,and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,,we are faced with political institutions,designed 400 years ago,,autonomous, sovereign nation-states,with jurisdictions and territories,separate from one another,,each claiming to be able to solve the problem,of its own people.,Twenty-first-century, transnational world,of problems and challenges,,17th-century world of political institutions.,In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.,And like many others, I've been thinking about,what can one do about this, this asymmetry,between 21st-century challenges,and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional,political institutions like nation-states. 
 And my suggestion is,that we change the subject,,that we stop talking about nations,,about bordered states,,and we start talking about cities.,Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities,,we are talking about the political institutions,in which civilization and culture were born.,We are talking about the cradle of democracy. 
 We are talking about the venues in which,those public spaces where we come together,to create democracy, and at the same time,protest those who would take our freedom, take place.,Think of some great names:,the Place de la Bastille,,Zuccotti Park,,Tahrir Square,,Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,,or, yes,,Tiananmen Square in Beijing. 
 (Applause) 
 Those are the public spaces,where we announce ourselves as citizens,,as participants, as people with the right,to write our own narratives.,Cities are not only the oldest of institutions,,they're the most enduring.,If you think about it,,Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.,Alexandria, much older than Egypt.,Rome, far older than Italy.,Cities endure the ages.,They are the places where we are born,,grow up, are educated, work, marry,,pray, play, get old, and in time, die.,They are home.,Very different than nation-states,,which are abstractions.,We pay taxes, we vote occasionally,,we watch the men and women we choose rule,rule more or less without us.,Not so in those homes known as our towns,and cities where we live.,Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population,live in cities.,In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.,More than three out of four people,live in urban institutions, urban places,,in cities today.,So cities are where the action is.,Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,,man is a political animal.,I say we are an urban animal.,We are an urban species, at home in our cities.,So to come back to the dilemma,,if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned,political nation-states unable to govern the world,,respond to the global challenges that we face,like climate change,,then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,,for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent,to engage in global governance. 
 When I say if mayors ruled the world,,when I first came up with that phrase,,it occurred to me that actually, they already do.,There are scores of international, inter-city,,cross-border institutions, networks of cities,in which cities are already, quite quietly,,below the horizon, working together,to deal with climate change, to deal with security,,to deal with immigration,,to deal with all of those tough,,interdependent problems that we face.,They have strange names:,UCLG,,United Cities and Local Governments;,ICLEI,,the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.,And the list goes on:,Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization,out of Barcelona that is using the web,to share best practices among countries.,And then all the things we know a little better,,the U.S. Conference of Mayors,,the Mexican Conference of Mayors,,the European Conference of Mayors.,Mayors are where this is happening. 
 And so the question is,,how can we create a world,in which mayors and the citizens they represent,play a more prominent role?,Well, to understand that,,we need to understand why cities are special,,why mayors are so different,than prime ministers and presidents,,because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister,are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.,To be a prime minister or a president,,you have to have an ideology,,you have to have a meta-narrative,,you have to have a theory of how things work,,you have to belong to a party.,Independents, on the whole,,don't get elected to office.,But mayors are just the opposite.,Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.,Their job is to get things done, and if they don't,,they're out of a job.,Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,,we could never get away here in Philadelphia,with the stuff that goes on in Washington,,the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.,Why? Because potholes have to get filled,,because the trains have to run,,because kids have to be able to get to school.,And that's what we have to do,,and to do that is about pragmatism,in that deep, American sense,,reaching outcomes.,Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,,are anything but pragmatic,,but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.,They have to get things done,,they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside,and draw their cities together.,We saw this a couple of decades ago,when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem,in the '80s and the '90s,,was besieged one day in his office,by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,,Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.,They were arguing with one another,about access to the holy sites.,And the squabble went on and on,,and Kollek listened and listened,,and he finally said, "Gentlemen,,spare me your sermons,,and I will fix your sewers." 
 (Laughter) 
 That's what mayors do.,They fix sewers, they get the trains running.,There isn't a left or a right way of doing.,Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.,Strange term, but in some ways, he is.,He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.,He rides to work on a bike,,but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.,Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat,,then he was a Republican,,and finally he was an Independent, and said,the party label just gets in the way.,Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,,though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,,in fact refused to be defined by the party,and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,,not under Gorbachev, but under Putin,,who wanted a more faithful party follower.,So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.,They get things done. 
 But the second thing about mayors,is they are also what I like to call homeboys,,or to include the women mayors, homies.,They're from the neighborhood.,They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.,Ed Koch used to wander around New York City,saying, "How am I doing?",Imagine David Cameron,wandering around the United Kingdom,asking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.,Or Putin. Or any national leader.,He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers,and they knew him.,Mayors are usually from the places they govern.,It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.,You can run for the Senate out of a different state,,but it's hard to do that as a mayor. 
 And as a result, mayors and city councillors,and local authorities,have a much higher trust level,,and this is the third feature about mayors,,than national governing officials.,In the United States, we know the pathetic figures:,18 percent of Americans approve of Congress,and what they do.,And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,,the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,,sometimes 50 percent at best.,The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.,But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,,do you trust your mayor?",the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,,because they're from the neighborhood,,because the people they work with are their neighbors,,because, like Mayor Booker in Newark,,a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work,and go in and pull people out of a burning building --,that happened to Mayor Booker --,or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work,because he sees it.,No head of state would be permitted,by their security details to do it,,nor be in a position to do it. 
 That's the difference, and the difference,has to do with the character of cities themselves,,because cities are profoundly multicultural,,open, participatory, democratic,,able to work with one another. 
 When states face each other,,China and the U.S., they face each other like this.,When cities interact, they interact like this.,China and the U.S., despite the recent,meta-meeting in California,,are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry,for number one.,We heard more about who will be number one.,Cities don't worry about number one.,They have to work together, and they do work together.,They work together in climate change, for example.,Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,,have been working together,many, many years before Copenhagen.,In Copenhagen, four or five years ago,,184 nations came together to explain to one another,why their sovereignty didn't permit them,to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,,but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited,200 mayors to attend.,They came, they stayed, and they found ways,and are still finding ways to work together,,city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.,Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,,which means cities are in a position,to solve the carbon problem, or most of it,,whether or not the states of which they are a part,make agreements with one another.,And they are doing it.,Los Angeles cleaned up its port,,which was 40 percent of carbon emissions,,and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.,New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,,make them better insulated in the winter,,to not leak energy in the summer,,not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.,Bogota, where Mayor Mockus,,when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system,that saved energy, that allowed surface buses,to run in effect like subways,,express buses with corridors.,It helped unemployment, because people could get across town,,and it had a profound impact on climate as well as,many other things there.,Singapore, as it developed its high-rises,and its remarkable public housing,,also developed an island of parks,,and if you go there, you'll see how much of it,is green land and park land.,Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.,They are doing it together.,They are sharing what they do,,and they are making a difference by shared best practices.,Bike shares, many of you have heard of it,,started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.,Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.,Pedestrian zones, congestion fees,,emission limits in cities like California cities have,,there's lots and lots that cities can do,even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act. 
 So what's the bottom line here?,The bottom line is, we still live politically,in a world of borders, a world of boundaries,,a world of walls,,a world where states refuse to act together.,Yet we know that the reality we experience,day to day is a world without borders,,a world of diseases without borders,and doctors without borders,,maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,,of economics and technology without borders,,of education without borders,,of terrorism and war without borders.,That is the real world, and unless we find a way,to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,,we will increasingly not only risk,the failure to address all of these transnational problems,,but we will risk losing democracy itself,,locked up in the old nation-state box,,unable to address global problems democratically. 
 So where does that leave us?,I'll tell you. The road to global democracy,doesn't run through states.,It runs through cities.,Democracy was born in the ancient polis.,I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.,In that journey from polis to cosmopolis,,we can rediscover the power,of democracy on a global level.,We can create not a League of Nations, which failed,,but a League of Cities,,not a United or a dis-United Nations,,but United Cities of the World.,We can create a global parliament of mayors.,That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,,but it's also on the table in City Halls,in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,,in Hamburg, and in New York.,Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually,constitute a global parliament of mayors,,and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors,is a parliament of citizens,and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,,of you and of me. 
 If ever there were citizens without borders,,I think it's the citizens of TED,who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.,I am ready to reach out and embrace,a new global democracy,,to take back our democracy.,And the only question is,,are you? 
 Thank you so much, my fellow citizens. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)So here's the most important economic fact of our time.,We are living in an age of surging income inequality,,particularly between those at the very top,and everyone else.,This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,,but it's a global phenomenon.,It's happening in communist China,,in formerly communist Russia,,it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.,We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies,like Sweden, Finland and Germany. 
 Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.,In the 1970s, the One Percent,accounted for about 10 percent of the national income,in the United States.,Today, their share has more than doubled,to above 20 percent.,But what's even more striking,is what's happening at the very tippy top,of the income distribution.,The 0.1 percent in the U.S.,today account for more than eight percent,of the national income.,They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.,Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,,and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005,by Robert Reich,,the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.,Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,,Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,,and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth,of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,,120 million people.,Now, as it happens,,Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,,he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,,and he has his own favorite number.,Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,,the combined wealth of the people,on the Forbes 400 list --,and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --,was 300 billion dollars.,Just think about it.,You didn't even need to be a billionaire,to get on that list in 1992.,Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled,to 1.7 trillion,,and I probably don't need to tell you,that we haven't seen anything similar happen,to the middle class,,whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased. 
 So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,,but we've been slow to notice it.,One of the reasons, I think,,is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.,Changes which are slow and gradual,can be hard to notice,even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.,Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.,But I think there's something else going on.,Talking about income inequality,,even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,,can make us feel uncomfortable.,It feels less positive, less optimistic,,to talk about how the pie is sliced,than to think about how to make the pie bigger.,And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,,talking about income distribution,,and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,,can be downright threatening. 
 So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,,especially at the top.,What's driving it, and what can we do about it? 
 One set of causes is political:,lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,,privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,,all of these have contributed,to more and more income going to the very, very top. 
 A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped,under the category of "crony capitalism,",political changes that benefit a group,of well-connected insiders,but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.,In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism,is incredibly difficult.,Think of all the years reformers of various stripes,have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,,or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks,even after the most profound financial crisis,since the Great Depression,,or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,,including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,",to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that,paid by the middle class.,But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice,is really, really hard,,at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.,After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.,Indeed, this is one of those rare issues,that unites the left and the right.,A critique of crony capitalism is as central,to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street. 
 But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,,the easy part of the problem,,things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers,of surging income inequality.,In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.,Globalization and the technology revolution,,the twin economic transformations,which are changing our lives,and transforming the global economy,,are also powering the rise of the super-rich.,Just think about it.,For the first time in history,,if you are an energetic entrepreneur,with a brilliant new idea,or a fantastic new product,,you have almost instant, almost frictionless access,to a global market of more than a billion people.,As a result, if you are very, very smart,and very, very lucky,,you can get very, very rich,very, very quickly.,The latest poster boy for this phenomenon,is David Karp.,The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr,recently sold his company to Yahoo,for 1.1 billion dollars.,Think about that for a minute:,1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.,It's easiest to see how the technology revolution,and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect,in highly visible fields,,like sports and entertainment.,We can all watch how a fantastic athlete,or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills,across the global economy as never before.,But today, that superstar effect,is happening across the entire economy.,We have superstar technologists.,We have superstar bankers.,We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.,There are superstar cooks,and superstar farmers.,There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,,superstar dentists,,the most dazzling exemplar of whom,is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers,to the smiles of fellow superstars,like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich,or European-born American fashion designer,Diane von Furstenberg. 
 But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization,and the technology revolution,are creating this global plutocracy,,what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.,And that's because,,in contrast with crony capitalism,,so much of what globalization and the technology revolution,have done is highly positive.,Let's start with technology.,I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.,I love the fact that they mean that,whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk,far beyond this auditorium.,I'm even more of a fan of globalization.,This is the transformation,which has lifted hundreds of millions,of the world's poorest people out of poverty,and into the middle class,,and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,,it's made many new products affordable --,who do you think built your iPhone? —,and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.,Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt. 
 So what's not to like?,Well, a few things.,One of the things that worries me,is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy,can become crony plutocracy.,Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur,who has successfully sold that idea or that product,to the global billions,and become a billionaire in the process.,It gets tempting at that point,to use your economic nous,to manipulate the rules of the global political economy,in your own favor.,And that's no mere hypothetical example.,Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.,These are among the world's most admired,,most beloved, most innovative companies.,They also happen to be particularly adept,at working the international tax system,so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.,And why stop at just playing the global political,and economic system as it exists,to your own maximum advantage?,Once you have the tremendous economic power,that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution,and the political power that inevitably entails,,it becomes tempting as well,to start trying to change the rules of the game,in your own favor.,Again, this is no mere hypothetical.,It's what the Russian oligarchs did,in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization,of Russia's natural resources.,It's one way of describing what happened,with deregulation of the financial services,in the U.S. and the U.K. 
 A second thing that worries me,is how easily meritocratic plutocracy,can become aristocracy.,One way of describing the plutocrats,is as alpha geeks,,and they are people who are acutely aware,of how important highly sophisticated,analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.,That's why they are spending,unprecedented time and resources,educating their own children.,The middle class is spending more on schooling too,,but in the global educational arms race,that starts at nursery school,and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,,the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned,by the One Percent.,The result is something that economists Alan Krueger,and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.,As income inequality increases,,social mobility decreases.,The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,,but increasingly you have to be born,on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race. 
 The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,,is the extent to which those same largely positive forces,which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy,also happen to be hollowing out the middle class,in Western industrialized economies.,Let's start with technology.,Those same forces that are creating billionaires,are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.,When's the last time you used a travel agent?,And in contrast with the industrial revolution,,the titans of our new economy,aren't creating that many new jobs.,At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,,Facebook fewer than 10,000.,The same is true of globalization.,For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people,out of poverty in the emerging markets,,it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs,from the developed Western economies.,The terrifying reality is,that there is no economic rule,which automatically translates,increased economic growth,into widely shared prosperity.,That's shown in what I consider to be,the most scary economic statistic of our time.,Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity,have been decoupled from increases,in wages and employment.,That means that our countries are getting richer,,our companies are getting more efficient,,but we're not creating more jobs,and we're not paying people, as a whole, more. 
 One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this,is to worry about structural unemployment.,What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.,After all, in a totally free labor market,,we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.,The dystopia that worries me,is a universe in which a few geniuses,invent Google and its ilk,and the rest of us are employed giving them massages. 
 So when I get really depressed about all of this,,I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.,After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,,it worked out pretty well, didn't it?,After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --,well, there are a few exceptions —,and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.,But it's important to remember,that before we learned how to share the fruits,of the Industrial Revolution,with the broad swathes of society,,we had to go through two depressions,,the Great Depression of the 1930s,,the Long Depression of the 1870s,,two world wars, communist revolutions,in Russia and in China,,and an era of tremendous social,and political upheaval in the West.,We also, not coincidentally,,went through an era of tremendous,social and political inventions.,We created the modern welfare state.,We created public education.,We created public health care.,We created public pensions.,We created unions. 
 Today, we are living through an era,of economic transformation,comparable in its scale and its scope,to the Industrial Revolution.,To be sure that this new economy benefits us all,and not just the plutocrats,,we need to embark on an era,of comparably ambitious social and political change.,We need a new New Deal. 
 (Applause)I come from Lebanon,,and I believe that runningncan change the world.,I know what I have just saidnis simply not obvious. 
 You know, Lebanon as a countrynhas been once destroyed,by a long and bloody civil war.,Honestly, I don't knownwhy they call it civil war,when there is nothing civil about it.,With Syria to the north,nIsrael and Palestine to the south,,and our governmentneven up till this moment,is still fragmented and unstable.,For years, the country has been dividednbetween politics and religion.,However, for one day a year,,we truly stand united,,and that's when the marathon takes place. 
 I used to be a marathon runner.,Long distance runningnwas not only good for my well-being,but it helped me meditate and dream big.,So the longer distances I ran,,the bigger my dreams became.,Until one fateful morning,,and while training, I was hit by a bus.,I nearly died, was in a coma,,stayed at the hospital for two years,,and underwent 36 surgeriesnto be able to walk again. 
 As soon as I came out of my coma,,I realized that I was no longernthe same runner I used to be,,so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,,I wanted to make sure that others could.,So out of my hospital bed,,I asked my husband to start taking notes,,and a few months later,nthe marathon was born. 
 Organizing a marathonnas a reaction to an accident,may sound strange,,but at that time, even duringnmy most vulnerable condition,,I needed to dream big.,I needed somethingnto take me out of my pain,,an objective to look forward to.,I didn't want to pity myself,nnor to be pitied,,and I thought by organizingnsuch a marathon,,I'll be able to pay back to my community,,build bridges with the outside world,,and invite runners to come to Lebanon,and run under the umbrella of peace. 
 Organizing a marathon in Lebanon,is definitely not like organizingnone in New York.,How do you introducenthe concept of running,to a nation that is constantlynat the brink of war?,How do you ask thosenwho were once fighting,and killing each other,to come together and runnnext to each other?,More than that, how do you convince peoplento run a distance of 26.2 miles,at a time they were not even familiarnwith the word "marathon"?,So we had to start from scratch. 
 For almost two years,nwe went all over the country,and even visited remote villages.,I personally met with peoplenfrom all walks of life --,mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,,politicians, militiamen,,people from mosques, churches,,the president of the country,neven housewives.,I learned one thing:,When you walk the talk,npeople believe you.,Many were touched by my personal story,,and they shared their stories in return.,It was honesty and transparencynthat brought us together.,We spoke one common languagento each other,,and that was from one human to another.,Once that trust was built,,everybody wantednto be part of the marathon,to show the world the true colorsnof Lebanon and the Lebanese,and their desire to livenin peace and harmony. 
 In October 2003, over 6,000 runners,from 49 different nationalities,came to the start line, all determined,,and when the gunfire went off,,this time it was a signalnto run in harmony,,for a change. 
 The marathon grew.,So did our political problems.,But for every disaster we had,,the marathon found waysnto bring people together.,In 2005, our prime ministernwas assassinated,,and the country camento a complete standstill,,so we organized a five-kilometernUnited We Run campaign.,Over 60,000 people came to the start line,,all wearing white T-shirtsnwith no political slogans.,That was a turning point for the marathon,,where people startednlooking at it as a platform,for peace and unity. 
 Between 2006 up to 2009,nour country, Lebanon,,went through unstable years,,invasions, and more assassinations,that brought us close to a civil war.,The country was divided again,,so much that our parliament resigned,,we had no president for a year,nand no prime minister.,But we did have a marathon. 
 (Applause) 
 So through the marathon, we learnednthat political problems can be overcome.,When the opposition party decidednto shut down part of the city center,,we negotiated alternative routes.,Government protestersnbecame sideline cheerleaders.,They even hosted juice stations. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, the marathonnhas really become one of its kind.,It gained credibility,from both the Lebanesenand the international community.,Last November 2012, over 33,000 runnersnfrom 85 different nationalities,came to the start line,,but this time, they challengedna very stormy and rainy weather.,The streets were flooded,nbut people didn't want to miss out,on the opportunity of being partnof such a national day. 
 BMA has expanded.,We include everyone:nthe young, the elderly,,the disabled, the mentally challenged,,the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,,even moms with their babies.,Themes have includednruns for the environment,,breast cancer, for the lovenof Lebanon, for peace,,or just simply to run. 
 The first annual all-women-and-girlsnrace for empowerment,,which is one of its kind in the region,,has just taken place only a few weeks ago,,with 4,512 women,nincluding the first lady,,and this is only the beginning. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 BMA has supported charities and volunteers,who have helped reshape Lebanon,,raising funds for their causes,and encouraging others to give.,The culture of giving and doing goodnhas become contagious.,Stereotypes have been broken.,Change-makers and future leadersnhave been created.,I believe these are the building blocksnfor future peace. 
 BMA has become such a respectednevent in the region,that government officials in the region,,like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,,have asked the organization to help themnstructure a similar sporting event.,We are now one of the largestnrunning events in the Middle East,,but most importantly,,it is a platform for hope and cooperation,in an ever-fragilenand unstable part of the world.,From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one. 
 (Applause) 
 After 10 years in Lebanon,,from national marathonsnor from national events,to smaller regional races,,we've seen that people wantnto run for a better future.,After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.,It is more of a marathon. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So if I was to ask you,what the connection between,a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,,you'd probably thinknthat's the easiest question,that you're going to be askednin Edinburgh all week.,But if I was to saynthat they're both examples,of alternative or new forms of currency,in a hyperconnected,ndata-driven global economy,,you'd probably thinknI was a little bit bonkers.,But trust me, I work in advertising. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I am going to tell you the answer,,but obviously after this short break. 
 So a more challenging question is one,that I was asked, actually,nby one of our writers,a couple of weeks ago,nand I didn't know the answer:,What's the world's bestnperforming currency?,It's actually Bitcoin.,Now, for those of younwho may not be familiar,,Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtualncurrency, synthetic currency.,It was founded in 2008nby this anonymous programmer,using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.,No one knows who or what he is.,He's almost like the Banksynof the Internet. 
 And I'm probably not goingnto do it proper service here,,but my interpretationnof how it works is that,Bitcoins are releasednthrough this process of mining.,So there's a networknof computers that are challenged,to solve a very complexnmathematical problem,and the person that manages to solvenit first gets the Bitcoins.,And the Bitcoins are released,,they're put into a publicnledger called the Blockchain,,and then they float, sonthey become a currency,,and completely decentralized,nthat's the sort of,scary thing about this,nwhich is why it's so popular.,So it's not runnby the authorities or the state.,It's actually managed by the network.,And the reason that it's provednvery successful,is it's private, it's anonymous,nit's fast, and it's cheap.,And you do get to the point wherenthere's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.,So in one level it wentnfrom something like 13 dollars,to 266, literallynin the space of four months,,and then crashed and lost halfnof its value in six hours.,And it's currently around that kind of,110 dollar mark in value. 
 But what it does shownis that it's sort of gaining ground,,it's gaining respectability.,You get services,nlike Reddit and Wordpress,are actually accepting Bitcoinnas a payment currency now.,And that's showing you that people,are actually placing trust in technology,,and it's started to trump and disrupt,and interrogate traditional institutions,and how we thinknabout currencies and money.,And that's not surprising,nif you think about,the basket case that is the E.U.,I think there was a Gallupnsurvey out recently,that said something like, in America,,trust in banks is at an all-timenlow, it's something like 21 percent.,And you can see herensome photographs from London,where Barclays sponsorednthe city bike scheme,,and some activists havendone some nice piece,of guerrilla marketing herenand doctored the slogans.,"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclaysntakes you for a ride.",These are the more polite onesnI could share with you today.,But you get the gist, sonpeople have really started,to sort of lose faith in institutions. 
 There's a P.R. company called Edelman,,they do this very interestingnsurvey every year,precisely around trustnand what people are thinking.,And this is a global survey,nso these numbers are global.,And what's interestingnis that you can see that,hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,,and it's all about heterarchical now,,so people trust peoplenlike themselves more,than they trust corporationsnand governments.,And if you look at these figuresnfor the more developed markets,like U.K., Germany, and so on,nthey're actually much lower.,And I find that sort of scary.,People are actuallyntrusting businesspeople,more than they're trustingngovernments and leaders. 
 So what's starting to happen,nif you think about money,,if you sort of boil moneyndown to an essence,,it is literally just an expressionnof value, an agreed value.,So what's happening now,nin the digital age,,is that we can quantify valuenin lots of different ways,and do it more easily,,and sometimes the waynthat we quantify those values,,it makes it much easier,to create new forms and validnforms of currency.,In that context, you can seenthat networks like Bitcoin,suddenly start to make a bit more sense. 
 So if you think we're starting to question,and disrupt and interrogatenwhat money means,,what our relationship with itnis, what defines money,,then the ultimate extension of that is,,is there a reasonnfor the government to be in charge,of money anymore?,So obviously I'm looking at thisnthrough a marketing prism,,so from a brand perspective,,brands literally stand or fallnon their reputations.,And if you think about it, reputationnhas now become a currency.,You know, reputations are built on trust,,consistency, transparency.,So if you've actually decidednthat you trust a brand,,you want a relationship, younwant to engage with the brand,,you're already kind of participatingnin lots of new forms,of currency. 
 So you think about loyalty.,Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.,You think about rewardsnschemes, air miles.,The Economist said a few years ago that,there are actually morenunredeemed air miles in the world,than there are dollarnbills in circulation.,You know, when you are standingnin line in Starbucks,,30 percent of transactionsnin Starbucks on any one day,are actually being madenwith Starbucks Star points.,So that's a sort of Starbucks currency,staying within its ecosystem. 
 And what I find interesting is that Amazon,has recently launched Amazon coins.,So admittedly it's a currency at the momentnthat's purely for the Kindle.,So you can buy apps and makenpurchases within those apps,,but you think about Amazon,,you look at the trustnbarometer that I showed you,where people are startingnto trust businesses,,especially businessesnthat they believe in and trust,more than governments.,So suddenly, you start thinking,,well Amazon potentially could push this.,It could become a natural extension,,that as well as buying stuff --,take it out of the Kindle --nyou could buy books, music,,real-life products, appliancesnand goods and so on.,And suddenly you're gettingnAmazon, as a brand,,is going head to headnwith the Federal Reserve,in terms of how you wantnto spend your money,,what money is, what constitutes money. 
 And I'll get you backnto Tide, the detergent now,,as I promised.,This is a fantastic article I camenacross in New York Magazine,,where it was saying that drugnusers across America,are actually purchasing drugs,with bottles of Tide detergent.,So they're going into convenience stores,,stealing Tide,,and a $20 bottle of Tide,is equal to 10 dollarsnof crack cocaine or weed.,And what they're saying,nso some criminologists,have looked at this and they'rensaying, well, okay,,Tide as a product sells at a premium.,It's 50 percentnabove the category average.,It's infused with a veryncomplex cocktail of chemicals,,so it smells very luxuriousnand very distinctive,,and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,,it's been supported by a lotnof mass media advertising.,So what they're saying is that drugnusers are consumers too,,so they have thisnin their neural pathways.,When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.,They say, that is trust. I trust that.nThat's quality.,So it becomes this unit of currency,,which the New York Magazine described,as a very oddly loyal crimenwave, brand-loyal crime wave,,and criminals are actuallyncalling Tide "liquid gold." 
 Now, what I thoughtnwas funny was the reaction,from the P&amp;G spokesperson.,They said, obviously triednto dissociate themselves from drugs,,but said, "It reminds me of one thing,and that's the value of the brandnhas stayed consistent." (Laughter),Which backs up my pointnand shows he didn't even,break a sweat when he said that. 
 So that brings me backnto the connection with sweat.,In Mexico, Nike has runna campaign recently,called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.,So you think about,,these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,,or you're using a Nike FuelBand,that basically tracksnyour movement, your energy,,your calorie consumption.,And what's happening here,nthis is where you've actually,elected to join that Nike community.nYou've bought into it.,They're not advertisingnloud messages at you,,and that's where advertisingnhas started to shift now,is into things like services,ntools and applications.,So Nike is literally actingnas a well-being partner,,a health and fitness partnernand service provider. 
 So what happens with thisnis they're saying, "Right,,you have a data dashboard.nWe know how far you've run,,how far you've moved, what your calorienintake, all that sort of stuff.,What you can do is, the more younrun, the more points you get,,and we have an auction wherenyou can buy Nike stuff,but only by proving that you've actuallynused the product to do stuff.",And you can't come into this.nThis is purely,for the community that are sweating,using Nike products. Youncan't buy stuff with pesos.,This is literally a closednenvironment, a closed auction space. 
 In Africa, you know, airtime has become,literally a currency in its own right.,People are used to,nbecause mobile is king,,they're very, very usednto transferring money,,making payments via mobile.,And one of my favorite examplesnfrom a brand perspective,going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,,lots of people make purchases in markets,and very small independent stores.,Loose change, smallnchange is a real problem,,and what tends to happennis you buy a bunch of stuff,,you're due, say,,10 cents, 20 cents in change.,The shopkeepers tend to givenyou things like an onion,or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,,because they don't have small change.,So when Vodafone camenin and saw this problem,,this consumer pain point, they created,some small change which they call Fakka,,which literally sits and is given,by the shopkeepers to people,,and it's credit that goesnstraight onto their mobile phone.,So this currency becomesncredit, which again,,is really, really interesting. 
 And we did a surveynthat backs up the fact that,,you know, 45 percent of people,in this very crucialndemographic in the U.S.,were saying that they're comfortable using,an independent or branded currency.,So that's getting really interesting here,,a really interesting dynamic going on.,And you think, corporations,should start taking their assetsnand thinking of them,in a different way and trading them.,And you think, is it much of a leap?,It seems farfetched,nbut when you think about it,,in America in 1860,,there were 1,600 corporationsnissuing banknotes.,There were 8,000 kindsnof notes in America.,And the only thing that stopped that,,the government controllednfour percent of the supply,,and the only thing that stopped it,was the Civil War breaking out,,and the government suddenly wantednto take control of the money.,So government, money, war,nnothing changes there, then. 
 So what I'm going to ask is, basically,,is history repeating itself?,Is technology making papernmoney feel outmoded?,Are we decoupling moneynfrom the government?,You know, you think about, brandsnare starting to fill the gaps.,Corporations are filling gapsnthat governments can't afford to fill.,So I think, you know,nwill we be standing on stage,buying a coffee -- organic,nfair trade coffee -- next year,using TED florins or TED shillings? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)So over the long course of human history,,the infectious disease that's killed more humans,than any other is malaria.,It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,,and it's probably our oldest scourge.,We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.,And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.,We've got 300 million cases a year,and over half a million deaths. 
 Now this really makes no sense.,We've known how to cure malaria,since the 1600s.,That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru,discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,,and inside that bark was quinine,,still an effective cure for malaria to this day.,So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.,We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.,That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross,discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,,not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.,So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,,and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people,are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.,Why is that? 
 This is a question that's,personally intrigued me for a long time.,I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants,visiting my cousins in India every summer,,and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,,I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night,while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep,out on the terrace and have,this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.,And I really hated the mosquitos for that.,But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,,and Jainism is a religion that espouses,a very extreme form of nonviolence.,So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.,We're not supposed to walk on grass,,because you could, you know,,inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.,We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.,So the fearsome power of this little insect,was apparent to me from a very young age,,and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist,trying to understand, why has malaria,been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?,And I think there's three main reasons why.,Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,,which is probably the biggest reason of all. 
 The first reason is certainly scientific.,This little parasite that causes malaria,,it's probably one of the most complex,and wily pathogens known to humankind.,It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito,and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.,These two environments are totally different,,but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.,So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,,and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.,This little creature survives under siege like that,,but not only does it survive, it has thrived.,It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.,It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.,Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,,the malaria parasite transforms itself like that,seven times in its life cycle.,And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,,they have totally different physiology.,So say you came up with some great drug,that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.,It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.,It can hide in our bodies, undetected,,unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,,for months, for years, in some cases even decades. 
 So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,,but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.,Only about 12 species of mosquitos,carry most of the world's malaria,,and we know quite a bit about the kinds of,watery habitats that they specialize in.,So you might think, then, well, why don't we just,avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?,We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live,and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.,But say you live in the tropics,and you walk outside your hut one day,and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt,around your home.,Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,,and then, say, it rains,,and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.,That's it. You've created the perfect,malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.,So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.,We kind of create places that they love to live,just by living our own lives. 
 So there's a huge scientific challenge,,but there's a huge economic challenge too.,Malaria occurs in some of the poorest,and most remote places on Earth,,and there's a reason for that.,If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.,If you're poor, you're more likely to live,in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.,These are places where mosquitos breed.,You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.,You're less likely to have electricity,and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,,so you're outside more.,You're getting bitten by mosquitos more. 
 So poverty causes malaria,,but what we also know now is that malaria itself,causes poverty.,For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,,so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields,collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.,But it also predisposes people to death,from all other causes.,So this has happened historically.,We've been able to take malaria out of a society.,Everything else stays the same,,so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,,all the things that make people sick.,But just if you take malaria out,,deaths from everything else go down.,And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified,what this means for a society.,What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,,your economic growth is depressed,by 1.3 percent every year,,year after year after year, just this one disease alone.,So this poses a huge economic challenge,,because say you do come up with your great drug,or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it,in a place where there's no roads,,there's no infrastructure,,there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,,there's no clinics, there's no clinicians,to deliver these things where they're needed?,So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria. 
 But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,,there's also a cultural challenge,,and this is probably the part about malaria,that people don't like to talk about.,And it's the paradox that the people,who have the most malaria in the world,tend to care about it the least.,This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.,They ask people in malarious parts of the world,,"What do you think about malaria?",And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it.",They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life.",And that was certainly my personal experience.,When I told my relatives in India,that I was writing a book about malaria,,they kind of looked at me like,I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.,Like, why would you write about something so boring,,so ordinary? You know?,And it's simple risk perception, really.,A child in Malawi, for example,,she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,,but if she survives,,she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,,but she's much less likely to die of it.,And so in her lived experience,,malaria is something that comes and goes.,And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.,Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.,It's just, there's so much malaria,that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death,add up to this big, huge number.,So I think people in malarious parts of the world,must think of malaria the way,those of us who live in the temperate world,think of cold and flu. Right?,Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies,and on our own lives,,but we don't really even take,the most rudimentary precautions against it because,we consider it normal to get cold and flu,during cold and flu season. 
 And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,,because if people think it's normal to have malaria,,then how do you get them to run to the doctor,to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,,to get it filled, to take the drugs,,to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?,This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease. 
 So take all that together.,We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,,it's economically challenging to deal with,,and it's one for which the people who stand,to benefit the most care about it the least.,And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,,which, of course, is the political problem.,How do you get a political leader to do anything,about a problem like this?,And the answer is, historically, you don't.,Most malarious societies throughout history,have simply lived with the disease.,So the main attacks on malaria have come,from outside of malarious societies,,from people who aren't constrained,by these rather paralyzing politics.,But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties. 
 The first concerted attack against malaria,started in the 1950s.,It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.,And this effort well understood the economic challenge.,They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,,and they focused on DDT.,They understood the cultural challenge.,In fact, their rather patronizing view was that,people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.,Everything should be done to them and for them.,But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.,They had so much faith in their tools,that they stopped doing malaria research.,And so when those tools started to fail,,and public opinion started to turn against those tools,,they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.,The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,,but now it was even worse than before,because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places,in the most difficult-to-control forms.,One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign,"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health." 
 The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.,It's similarly directed and financed primarily,from outside of malarious societies.,Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.,They are doing tons of malaria research.,And they understand the economic challenge too.,They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.,But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.,The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.,It's treated with insecticides.,This thing has been distributed across the malarious world,by the millions.,And when you think about the bed net,,it's sort of a surgical intervention.,You know, it doesn't really have any value,to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.,And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.,They have to sleep under them every night.,That's the only way they are effective.,And they have to do that,even if the net blocks the breeze,,even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night,and relieve themselves,,even if they might have to move all their furnishings,to put this thing up,,even if, you know, they might live in a round hut,in which it's difficult to string up a square net.,Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.,I mean, these are minor inconveniences.,But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.,So for them, the calculus must be quite different. 
 Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans,came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,,"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.,We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,,we're going to give it to you for free.,It's called a face mask,,and all you need to do is,wear it every day during cold and flu season,when you go to school and when you go to work.",Would we do that? 
 And I wonder if that's how people,in the malarious world thought of those nets,when they first received them?,Indeed, we know from studies,that only 20 percent of the bed nets,that were first distributed were actually used.,And even that's probably an overestimate,,because the same people who distributed the nets,went back and asked the recipients,,"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?",Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,,"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?",So it's probably an overestimate. 
 But that's not an insurmountable problem.,We can do more education,,we can try to convince these people to use the nets.,And that's what happening now.,We're throwing a lot more time and money,into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays,and school meetings,,all these things to convince people,to use the nets we gave you.,And that might work.,But it takes time. It takes money.,It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.,It takes all the things that that cheap,,easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be. 
 So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,,but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it,from outside of those societies.,We end up imposing our own priorities,on the people of the malarious world.,That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,,and that effort backfired.,I would argue today,,when we are distributing tools that we've designed,and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,,we run the risk of making the same mistake again. 
 That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,,because I think it is,,but what if we attacked this disease,according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?,Take the example of England and the United States.,We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,,and we got rid of it completely,,not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.,We attacked bad roads and bad houses,and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.,We attacked the malarious way of life,,and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.,Now attacking the malarious way of life,,this is something -- these are things people care about today.,And attacking the malarious way of life,,it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,,but I think it's the only lasting way forward. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)There is something you know about me,,something very personal,,and there is somethingnI know about every one of you,and that's very central to your concerns.,There is something that we know,about everyone we meetnanywhere in the world, on the street,,that is the very mainspringnof whatever they do,and whatever they put up with.,And that is that all of usnwant to be happy.,In this, we are all together.,How we imagine our happiness,nthat differs from one another,,but it's already a lotnthat we have all in common,,that we want to be happy. 
 Now my topic is gratefulness.,What is the connectionnbetween happiness and gratefulness?,Many people would say,nwell, that's very easy.,When you are happy, you are grateful.,But think again.,Is it really the happy peoplenthat are grateful?,We all know quite a number of people,who have everythingnthat it would take to be happy,,and they are not happy,,because they want something elsenor they want more of the same.,And we all know peoplenwho have lots of misfortune,,misfortune that we ourselvesnwould not want to have,,and they are deeply happy.,They radiate happiness. You are surprised.,Why? Because they are grateful.,So it is not happinessnthat makes us grateful.,It's gratefulness that makes us happy.,If you think it's happinessnthat makes you grateful,,think again.,It's gratefulness that makes you happy. 
 Now, we can ask,,what do we really mean by gratefulness?,And how does it work?,I appeal to your own experience.,We all know from experience how it goes.,We experience somethingnthat's valuable to us.,Something is given to usnthat's valuable to us.,And it's really given.,These two things have to come together.,It has to be something valuable,nand it's a real gift.,You haven't bought it.nYou haven't earned it.,You haven't traded it in.nYou haven't worked for it.,It's just given to you.,And when these two things come together,,something that's really valuable to menand I realize it's freely given,,then gratefulness spontaneouslynrises in my heart,,happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.,That's how gratefulness happens. 
 Now the key to all this,is that we cannot onlynexperience this once in a while.,We cannot only have grateful experiences.,We can be people who live gratefully.,Grateful living, that is the thing.,And how can we live gratefully?,By experiencing, by becoming aware,that every momentnis a given moment, as we say.,It's a gift. You haven't earned it.,You haven't brought it about in any way.,You have no way of assuring,that there will benanother moment given to you,,and yet, that's the most valuable thingnthat can ever be given to us,,this moment, with all the opportunitynthat it contains.,If we didn't have this present moment,,we wouldn't havenany opportunity to do anything,or experience anything,,and this moment is a gift.,It's a given moment, as we say. 
 Now, we say the gift within this giftnis really the opportunity.,What you are really grateful fornis the opportunity,,not the thing that is given to you,,because if that thing were somewhere else,and you didn't haventhe opportunity to enjoy it,,to do something with it,,you wouldn't be grateful for it.,Opportunity is the gift within every gift,,and we have this saying,nopportunity knocks only once.,Well, think again.,Every moment is a new gift,nover and over again,,and if you miss the opportunitynof this moment,,another moment is given to us,nand another moment.,We can avail ourselvesnof this opportunity,,or we can miss it,,and if we avail ourselvesnof the opportunity,,it is the key to happiness.,Behold the master key to our happiness,in our own hands.,Moment by moment,nwe can be grateful for this gift. 
 Does that mean,that we can be grateful for everything?,Certainly not.,We cannot be gratefulnfor violence, for war,,for oppression, for exploitation.,On the personal level,nwe cannot be grateful,for the loss of a friend,nfor unfaithfulness,,for bereavement.,But I didn't saynwe can be grateful for everything.,I said we can be gratefulnin every given moment,for the opportunity,,and even when we are confrontednwith something that is terribly difficult,,we can rise to this occasion,and respond to the opportunitynthat is given to us.,It isn't as bad as it might seem.,Actually, when you look at itnand experience it,,you find that most of the time,,what is given to usnis the opportunity to enjoy,,and we only miss itnbecause we are rushing through life,and we are not stoppingnto see the opportunity. 
 But once in a while,,something very difficult is given to us,,and when this difficult thingnoccurs to us,,it's a challenge to risento that opportunity,,and we can rise to itnby learning something,which is sometimes painful.,Learning patience, for instance.,We have been told that the road to peace,is not a sprint,nbut is more like a marathon.,That takes patience. That's difficult.,It may be to stand up for your opinion,nto stand up for your conviction.,That's an opportunity that is given to us.,To learn, to suffer, to stand up,,all these opportunities are given to us,,but they are opportunities,,and those who avail themselvesnof those opportunities,are the ones that we admire.,They make something out of life.,And those who failnget another opportunity.,We always get another opportunity.,That's the wonderful richness of life. 
 So how can we find a methodnthat will harness this?,How can each one of us find a methodnfor living gratefully,,not just once in a while being grateful,,but moment by moment to be grateful.,How can we do it?nIt's a very simple method.,It's so simple that it's actuallynwhat we were told as children,when we learned to cross the street.,Stop.,Look.,Go.,That's all.,But how often do we stop?,We rush through life. We don't stop.,We miss the opportunitynbecause we don't stop.,We have to stop.,We have to get quiet.,And we have to buildnstop signs into our lives. 
 When I was in Africansome years ago and then came back,,I noticed water.,In Africa where I was,nI didn't have drinkable water.,Every time I turned on the faucet,nI was overwhelmed.,Every time I clicked on the light,nI was so grateful.,It made me so happy.,But after a while, this wears off.,So I put little stickersnon the light switch,and on the water faucet,,and every time I turned it on, water.,So leave it up to your own imagination.,You can find whatever works best for you,,but you need stop signs in your life.,And when you stop,,then the next thing is to look.,You look. You open your eyes.,You open your ears. You open your nose.,You open all your senses,for this wonderful richnessnthat is given to us.,There is no end to it,nand that is what life is all about,,to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. 
 And then we can also open our hearts,,our hearts for the opportunities,,for the opportunities also to help others,,to make others happy,,because nothing makes us more happynthan when all of us are happy.,And when we opennour hearts to the opportunities,,the opportunities invite usnto do something,,and that is the third.,Stop, look, and then go,nand really do something.,And what we can do,is whatever life offers to younin that present moment.,Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,,but sometimesnit's something more difficult. 
 But whatever it is,nif we take this opportunity,,we go with it, we are creative,nthose are the creative people.,And that little stop, look, go,,is such a potent seed,that it can revolutionize our world.,Because we are at the present moment,in the middle of a changenof consciousness,,and you will be surprised if you --,I am always surprisednwhen I hear how many times,this word "gratefulness"nand "gratitude" comes up.,Everywhere you find it,,a grateful airline,na restaurant gratefulness,,a café gratefulness,na wine that is gratefulness.,Yes, I have even come acrossna toilet paper,whose brand is called "Thank You." 
 (Laughter) 
 There is a wave of gratefulness,because people are becoming awarenhow important this is,and how this can change our world.,It can change our worldnin immensely important ways,,because if you're grateful,nyou're not fearful,,and if you're not fearful,nyou're not violent.,If you're grateful,nyou act out of a sense of enough,and not of a sense of scarcity,,and you are willing to share.,If you are grateful,,you are enjoyingnthe differences between people,,and you are respectful to everybody,,and that changes this power pyramidnunder which we live. 
 And it doesn't make for equality,nbut it makes for equal respect,,and that is the important thing.,The future of the world will be a network,,not a pyramid turned upside down.,The revolution of which I am speakingnis a nonviolent revolution,,and it's so revolutionarynthat it even revolutionizes,the very concept of a revolution,,because the normal revolution,is one where the power pyramidnis turned upside down,and those who were on the bottomnare now on the top,and are doing exactly the same thingnthat the ones before.,What we need is a networkingnof smaller groups,,smaller and smaller groupsnwho know one another,,who interact with one another,nand that is a grateful world. 
 A grateful worldnis a world of joyful people.,Grateful people are joyful people,,and joyful people --,the more and more joyful people there are,,the more and morenwe'll have a joyful world.,We have a network for grateful living,nand it has mushroomed.,We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.,We have an opportunitynfor people to light a candle,when they are grateful for something.,And there have beenn15 million candles lit in one decade.,People are becoming awarenthat a grateful world is a happy world,,and we all have the opportunitynby the simple stop, look, go,,to transform the world,nto make it a happy place.,And that is what I hope for us,,and if this has contributed a littlento making you want to do the same,,stop, look, go. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We have a global health challenge,in our hands today,,and that is that the way we currently,discover and develop new drugs,is too costly, takes far too long,,and it fails more often than it succeeds.,It really just isn't working, and that means,that patients that badly need new therapies,are not getting them,,and diseases are going untreated.,We seem to be spending more and more money.,So for every billion dollars we spend in R&D,,we're getting less drugs approved into the market.,More money, less drugs. Hmm. 
 So what's going on here?,Well, there's a multitude of factors at play,,but I think one of the key factors,is that the tools that we currently have,available to test whether a drug is going to work,,whether it has efficacy,,or whether it's going to be safe,before we get it into human clinical trials,,are failing us. They're not predicting,what's going to happen in humans.,And we have two main tools available,at our disposal.,They are cells in dishes and animal testing. 
 Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.,So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.,We take them and rip them out,of their native environment,nthrow them in one of these dishes,,and expect them to work.,Guess what. They don't.,They don't like that environment,because it's nothing like,what they have in the body. 
 What about animal testing?,Well, animals do and can provide,extremely useful information.,They teach us about what happens,in the complex organism.,We learn more about the biology itself.,However, more often than not,,animal models fail to predictnwhat will happen in humans,when they're treated with a particular drug. 
 So we need better tools.,We need human cells,,but we need to find a way to keep them happy,outside the body. 
 Our bodies are dynamic environments.,We're in constant motion.,Our cells experience that.,They're in dynamic environments in our body.,They're under constant mechanical forces.,So if we want to make cells happy,outside our bodies,,we need to become cell architects.,We need to design, build and engineer,a home away from home for the cells. 
 And at the Wyss Institute,,we've done just that.,We call it an organ-on-a-chip.,And I have one right here.,It's beautiful, isn't it?nBut it's pretty incredible.,Right here in my hand is a breathing, living,human lung on a chip. 
 And it's not just beautiful.,It can do a tremendous amount of things.,We have living cells in that little chip,,cells that are in a dynamic environment,interacting with different cell types.,There's been many people,trying to grow cells in the lab.,They've tried many different approaches.,They've even tried to grownlittle mini-organs in the lab.,We're not trying to do that here.,We're simply trying to recreate,in this tiny chip,the smallest functional unit,that represents the biochemistry,,the function and the mechanical strain,that the cells experience in our bodies.,So how does it work? Let me show you.,We use techniques from the computer chip,manufacturing industry,to make these structures at a scale,relevant to both the cells and their environment.,We have three fluidic channels.,In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane,on which we can add human cells,from, say, our lungs,,and then underneath, they had capillary cells,,the cells in our blood vessels.,And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip,that stretch and contract the membrane,,so the cells experience the same mechanical forces,that they did when we breathe.,And they experience them how they did in the body.,There's air flowing through the top channel,,and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients,through the blood channel.,Now the chip is really beautiful,,but what can we do with it?,We can get incredible functionality,inside these little chips.,Let me show you.,We could, for example, mimic infection,,where we add bacterial cells into the lung.,then we can add human white blood cells.,White blood cells are our body's defense,against bacterial invaders,,and when they sense thisninflammation due to infection,,they will enter from the blood into the lung,and engulf the bacteria.,Well now you're going to see this happening,live in an actual human lung on a chip.,We've labeled the white blood cellsnso you can see them flowing through,,and when they detect that infection,,they begin to stick.,They stick, and then they try to go into the lung,side from blood channel.,And you can see here, we can actually visualize,a single white blood cell.,It sticks, it wiggles its way through,between the cell layers, through the pore,,comes out on the other side of the membrane,,and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria,labeled in green.,In that tiny chip, you just witnessed,one of the most fundamental responses,our body has to an infection.,It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.,It's pretty exciting. 
 Now I want to share this picture with you,,not just because it's so beautiful,,but because it tells us an enormousnamount of information,about what the cells are doing within the chips.,It tells us that these cells,from the small airways in our lungs,,actually have these hairlike structures,that you would expect to see in the lung.,These structures are called cilia,,and they actually move the mucus out of the lung.,Yeah. Mucus. Yuck.,But mucus is actually very important.,Mucus traps particulates, viruses,,potential allergens,,and these little cilia move,and clear the mucus out.,When they get damaged, say,,by cigarette smoke for example,,they don't work properly,nand they can't clear that mucus out.,And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.,Cilia and the clearance of mucus,are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.,But now, with the functionalitynthat we get in these chips,,we can begin to look,for potential new treatments. 
 We didn't stop with the lung on a chip.,We have a gut on a chip.,You can see one right here.,And we've put intestinal human cells,in a gut on a chip,,and they're under constant peristaltic motion,,this trickling flow through the cells,,and we can mimic many of the functions,that you actually would expect to see,in the human intestine.,Now we can begin to create models of diseases,such as irritable bowel syndrome.,This is a disease that affects,a large number of individuals.,It's really debilitating,,and there aren't really many good treatments for it. 
 Now we have a whole pipeline,of different organ chips,that we are currently working on in our labs.,Now, the true power of this technology, however,,really comes from the fact,that we can fluidically link them.,There's fluid flowing across these cells,,so we can begin to interconnect,multiple different chips together,to form what we call a virtual human on a chip.,Now we're really getting excited.,We're not going to ever recreate na whole human in these chips,,but what our goal is is to be able to recreate,sufficient functionality,so that we can make better predictions,of what's going to happen in humans.,For example, now we can begin to explore,what happens when we putna drug like an aerosol drug.,Those of you like me who have asthma,nwhen you take your inhaler,,we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,,how it enters the body,,how it might affect, say, your heart.,Does it change the beating of your heart?,Does it have a toxicity?,Does it get cleared by the liver?,Is it metabolized in the liver?,Is it excreted in your kidneys?,We can begin to study the dynamic,response of the body to a drug. 
 This could really revolutionize,and be a game changer,for not only the pharmaceutical industry,,but a whole host of different industries,,including the cosmetics industry.,We can potentially use the skin on a chip,that we're currently developing in the lab,to test whether the ingredients in those products,that you're using are actually nsafe to put on your skin,without the need for animal testing.,We could test the safety,of chemicals that we are exposed to,on a daily basis in our environment,,such as chemicals in regular household cleaners.,We could also use the organs on chips,for applications in bioterrorism,or radiation exposure.,We could use them to learn more about,diseases such as ebola,or other deadly diseases such as SARS. 
 Organs on chips could also change,the way we do clinical trials in the future.,Right now, the average participant,in a clinical trial is that: average.,Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female.,You won't find many clinical trials,in which children are involved,,yet every day, we give children medications,,and the only safety data we have on that drug,is one that we obtained from adults.,Children are not adults.,They may not respond in the same way adults do.,There are other things like genetic differences,in populations,that may lead to at-risk populations,that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.,Now imagine if we could take cellsnfrom all those different populations,,put them on chips,,and create populations on a chip.,This could really change the way,we do clinical trials.,And this is the team and the peoplenthat are doing this.,We have engineers, we have cell biologists,,we have clinicians, all working together.,We're really seeing something quite incredible,at the Wyss Institute.,It's really a convergence of disciplines,,where biology is influencing the way we design,,the way we engineer, the way we build.,It's pretty exciting. 
 We're establishing important industry collaborations,such as the one we have with a company,that has expertise in large-scalendigital manufacturing.,They're going to help us make,,instead of one of these,,millions of these chips,,so that we can get them into the hands,of as many researchers as possible.,And this is key to the potential of that technology. 
 Now let me show you our instrument.,This is an instrument that our engineers,are actually prototyping right now in the lab,,and this instrument is going to give us,the engineering controls that we're going to require,in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.,It does something else that's very important.,It creates an easy user interface.,So a cell biologist like me can come in,,take a chip, put it in a cartridge,like the prototype you see there,,put the cartridge into the machine,just like you would a C.D.,,and away you go.,Plug and play. Easy. 
 Now, let's imagine a little bit,what the future might look like,if I could take your stem cells,and put them on a chip,,or your stem cells and put them on a chip.,It would be a personalized chip just for you. 
 Now all of us in here are individuals,,and those individual differences mean,that we could react very differently,and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.,I myself, a couple of years back,nhad a really bad headache,,just couldn't shake it, thought, n"Well, I'll try something different.",I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,,I was on my way to the emergency room,with a full-blown asthma attack.,Now, obviously it wasn't fatal,,but unfortunately, some of these,adverse drug reactions can be fatal. 
 So how do we prevent them?,Well, we could imagine one day,having Geraldine on a chip,,having Danielle on a chip,,having you on a chip. 
 Personalized medicine. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I'm going to talk about trust,,and I'm going to start by reminding you,of the standard views that people have about trust.,I think these are so commonplace,,they've become clichés of our society.,And I think there are three.,One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,,very widely believed.,The second is an aim: we should have more trust.,And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust. 
 I think that the claim, the aim and the task,are all misconceived.,So what I'm going to try to tell you today,is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task,which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter. 
 First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?,And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,,I don't know the answer.,I'm inclined to think it may have declined,in some activities or some institutions,and it might have grown in others.,I don't have an overview.,But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,,and the opinion polls are supposedly,the source of a belief that trust has declined.,When you actually look at opinion polls across time,,there's not much evidence for that.,That's to say, the people who were mistrusted,20 years ago,,principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.,And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago,are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.,The rest of us are in between,,and by the way, the average person in the street,is almost exactly midway.,But is that good evidence?,What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.,What else can they record?,So they're looking at the generic attitudes,that people report when you ask them certain questions.,Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers? 
 Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?,Do you trust fishmongers?,Do you trust elementary school teachers?",you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?",And that would be a perfectly sensible response.,And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,,"Well, I trust some of them, but not others.",That's a perfectly rational thing.,In short, in our real lives,,we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.,We don't make an assumption that the level of trust,that we will have in every instance of a certain type,of official or office-holder or type of person,is going to be uniform.,I might, for example, say that I certainly trust,a certain elementary school teacher I know,to teach the reception class to read,,but in no way to drive the school minibus.,I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.,I might trust my most loquacious friend,to keep a conversation going,but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.,Simple. 
 So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives,of the way that trust is differentiated,,why do we sort of drop all that intelligence,when we think about trust more abstractly?,I think the polls are very bad guides,to the level of trust that actually exists,,because they try to obliterate the good judgment,that goes into placing trust. 
 Secondly, what about the aim?,The aim is to have more trust.,Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.,It's not what I would aim at.,I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy,but not in the untrustworthy.,In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.,And I think, of those people who, for example,,placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,,who then made off with them,,and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,,too much trust.,More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.,Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust,is the proper aim.,Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,,that means that what matters in the first place,is not trust but trustworthiness.,It's judging how trustworthy people are,in particular respects. 
 And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.,Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?,And if we find that a person is competent,in the relevant matters,,and reliable and honest,,we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,,because they'll be trustworthy.,But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.,I have friends who are competent and honest,,but I would not trust them to post a letter,,because they're forgetful.,I have friends who are very confident,they can do certain things,,but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.,And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends,who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.,(Laughter),If so, I haven't yet spotted it. 
 But that's what we're looking for:,trustworthiness before trust.,Trust is the response.,Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.,And, of course, it's difficult.,Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct,systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions,and professionals and officials and so on,that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.,A lot of these systems have the converse effect.,They don't work as they're supposed to.,I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,,"Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer,to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.",And all over our public life, our institutional life,,we find that problem,,that the system of accountability,that is meant to secure trustworthiness,and evidence of trustworthiness,is actually doing the opposite.,It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,,like midwives, from doing them,by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.,You can all give your own examples there. 
 So so much for the aim.,The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,,and that is going to be different,if we are trying to be trustworthy,and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,,and if we are trying to judge whether other people,or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.,It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,,attitudes, don't do adequately here. 
 Now thirdly, the task.,Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,,also gets things backwards.,It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.,Well, we can do that for ourselves.,We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.,We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.,But trust, in the end, is distinctive,because it's given by other people.,You can't rebuild what other people give you.,You have to give them the basis,for giving you their trust.,So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.,And that, of course, is because you can't fool,all of the people all of the time, usually.,But you also have to provide usable evidence,that you are trustworthy.,How to do it?,Well every day, all over the place, it's being done,by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,,quite effectively.,Let me give you a simple commercial example.,The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,,and they don't ask any questions.,They take them back and give me the money,or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.,That's super. I trust them,because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.,I think there's a big lesson in that.,If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,,then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy,and you have confidence in what you are saying.,So in the end, I think what we are aiming for,is not very difficult to discern.,It is relationships in which people are trustworthy,and can judge when and how the other person,is trustworthy. 
 So the moral of all this is,,we need to think much less about trust,,let alone about attitudes of trust,detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,,much more about being trustworthy,,and how you give people adequate, useful,and simple evidence that you're trustworthy. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Steve Ramirez: My firstnyear of grad school,,I found myself in my bedroom,eating lots of Ben & Jerry's,watching some trashy TV,and maybe, maybe listeningnto Taylor Swift.,I had just gone through a breakup.,(Laughter),So for the longest time, all I would do,is recall the memory of thisnperson over and over again,,wishing that I could getnrid of that gut-wrenching,,visceral "blah" feeling.,Now, as it turns out,nI'm a neuroscientist,,so I knew that the memory of that person,and the awful, emotional undertonesnthat color in that memory,,are largely mediatednby separate brain systems.,And so I thought, what if we couldngo into the brain,and edit out that nauseating feeling,but while keeping the memorynof that person intact?,Then I realized, maybenthat's a little bit lofty for now.,So what if we could startnoff by going into the brain,and just finding a singlenmemory to begin with?,Could we jump-startnthat memory back to life,,maybe even play with the contentsnof that memory?,All that said, there is one personnin the entire world right now,that I really hope is notnwatching this talk.,(Laughter),So there is a catch. There is a catch.,These ideas probably remindnyou of "Total Recall,","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,",or of "Inception.",But the movie stars that we work with,are the celebrities of the lab.,Xu Liu: Test mice.,(Laughter),As neuroscientists, we worknin the lab with mice,trying to understand how memory works.,And today, we hopento convince you that now,we are actually able to activatena memory in the brain,at the speed of light.,To do this, there's only two simplensteps to follow.,First, you find and labelna memory in the brain,,and then you activate it with a switch.,As simple as that.,(Laughter),SR: Are you convinced?,So, turns out finding a memorynin the brain isn't all that easy.,XL: Indeed. This is way morendifficult than, let's say,,finding a needle in a haystack,,because at least, you know,nthe needle is still something,you can physically put your fingers on.,But memory is not.,And also, there's waynmore cells in your brain,than the number of strawsnin a typical haystack.,So yeah, this task doesnseem to be daunting.,But luckily, we got helpnfrom the brain itself.,It turned out that all we neednto do is basically,to let the brain form a memory,,and then the brain will tellnus which cells are involved,in that particular memory.,SR: So what was going on in my brain,while I was recalling the memory of an ex?,If you were to just completelynignore human ethics for a second,and slice up my brain right now,,you would see that therenwas an amazing number,of brain regions that were activenwhile recalling that memory.,Now one brain regionnthat would be robustly active,in particular is called the hippocampus,,which for decades hasnbeen implicated in processing,the kinds of memoriesnthat we hold near and dear,,which also makes itnan ideal target to go into,and to try and find and maybenreactivate a memory.,XL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus,,of course you will see lots of cells,,but we are able to findnwhich cells are involved,in a particular memory,,because whenever a cell is active,,like when it's forming a memory,,it will also leave a footprintnthat will later allow us to know,these cells are recently active.,SR: So the same waynthat building lights at night,let you know that somebody's probablynworking there at any given moment,,in a very real sense, therenare biological sensors,within a cell that are turned on,only when that cell was just working.,They're sort of biologicalnwindows that light up,to let us know that that cellnwas just active.,XL: So we clipped part of this sensor,,and attached that to a switchnto control the cells,,and we packed this switchninto an engineered virus,and injected that into the brainnof the mice.,So whenever a memory is being formed,,any active cells for that memory,will also have this switch installed.,SR: So here is what the hippocampusnlooks like,after forming a fear memory, for example.,The sea of blue that you see here,are densely packed brain cells,,but the green brain cells,,the green brain cellsnare the ones that are holding on,to a specific fear memory.,So you are looking at the crystallization,of the fleeting formation of fear.,You're actually lookingnat the cross-section of a memory right now.,XL: Now, for the switchnwe have been talking about,,ideally, the switch hasnto act really fast.,It shouldn't take minutesnor hours to work.,It should act at the speednof the brain, in milliseconds.,SR: So what do you think, Xu?,Could we use, let's say,npharmacological drugs,to activate or inactivate brain cells?,XL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy.nThey spread everywhere.,And also it takes themnforever to act on cells.,So it will not allow usnto control a memory in real time.,So Steve, how about let's zapnthe brain with electricity?,SR: So electricity is pretty fast,,but we probably wouldn'tnbe able to target it,to just the specific cellsnthat hold onto a memory,,and we'd probably fry the brain.,XL: Oh. That's true.nSo it looks like, hmm,,indeed we need to find a better way,to impact the brain at the speed of light.,SR: So it just so happens that lightntravels at the speed of light.,So maybe we could activatenor inactive memories,by just using light --,XL: That's pretty fast.,SR: -- and because normally brain cells,don't respond to pulses of light,,so those that would respondnto pulses of light,are those that containna light-sensitive switch.,Now to do that, first we neednto trick brain cells,to respond to laser beams.,XL: Yep. You heard it right.,We are trying to shootnlasers into the brain.,(Laughter),SR: And the technique that letsnus do that is optogenetics.,Optogenetics gave us thisnlight switch that we can use,to turn brain cells on or off,,and the name of that switchnis channelrhodopsin,,seen here as these green dotsnattached to this brain cell.,You can think of channelrhodopsinnas a sort of light-sensitive switch,that can be artificiallyninstalled in brain cells,so that now we can use that switch,to activate or inactivate the brainncell simply by clicking it,,and in this case we clicknit on with pulses of light.,XL: So we attach this light-sensitivenswitch of channelrhodopsin,to the sensor we've been talking about,and inject this into the brain.,So whenever a memory is being formed,,any active cell for that particular memory,will also have this light-sensitivenswitch installed in it,so that we can control these cells,by the flipping of a lasernjust like this one you see.,SR: So let's put all of thisnto the test now.,What we can do is we can take our mice,and then we can put them in a boxnthat looks exactly like this box here,,and then we can give themna very mild foot shock,so that they form a fearnmemory of this box.,They learn that somethingnbad happened here.,Now with our system,nthe cells that are active,in the hippocampusnin the making of this memory,,only those cells will nowncontain channelrhodopsin.,XL: When you are as small as a mouse,,it feels as if the wholenworld is trying to get you.,So your best response of defense,is trying to be undetected.,Whenever a mouse is in fear,,it will show this very typical behavior,by staying at one corner of the box,,trying to not move any part of its body,,and this posture is called freezing.,So if a mouse remembers that somethingnbad happened in this box,,and when we put themnback into the same box,,it will basically show freezing,because it doesn't want to be detected,by any potential threats in this box.,SR: So you can think of freezing as,,you're walking down the streetnminding your own business,,and then out of nowherenyou almost run into,an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend,,and now those terrifying two seconds,where you start thinking, "What do I do?nDo I say hi?,Do I shake their hand? DonI turn around and run away?,Do I sit here and pretendnlike I don't exist?",Those kinds of fleeting thoughtsnthat physically incapacitate you,,that temporarily give younthat deer-in-headlights look.,XL: However, if you put the mousenin a completely different,new box, like the next one,,it will not be afraid of this box,because there's no reason that itnwill be afraid of this new environment.,But what if we putnthe mouse in this new box,but at the same time,nwe activate the fear memory,using lasers just like we did before?,Are we going to bring back the fear memory,for the first box into thisncompletely new environment?,SR: All right,nand here's the million-dollar experiment.,Now to bring back to lifenthe memory of that day,,I remember that the Red Sox had just won,,it was a green spring day,,perfect for going up and down the river,and then maybe going to the North End,to get some cannolis, #justsaying.,Now Xu and I, on the other hand,,were in a completely windowless black room,not making any ocular movementnthat even remotely resembles an eye blink,because our eyes were fixednonto a computer screen.,We were looking at this mousenhere trying to activate a memory,for the first time using our technique.,XL: And this is what we saw.,When we first put the mouse into this box,,it's exploring, sniffingnaround, walking around,,minding its own business,,because actually by nature,,mice are pretty curious animals.,They want to know, what's goingnon in this new box?,It's interesting.,But the moment we turnednon the laser, like you see now,,all of a sudden the mousenentered this freezing mode.,It stayed here and tried notnto move any part of its body.,Clearly it's freezing.,So indeed, it looksnlike we are able to bring back,the fear memory for the first box,in this completely new environment.,While watching this, Steve and I,are as shocked as the mouse itself.,(Laughter),So after the experiment,nthe two of us just left the room,without saying anything.,After a kind of long,nawkward period of time,,Steve broke the silence.,SR: "Did that just work?",XL: "Yes," I said. "Indeed it worked!",We're really excited about this.,And then we published our findings,in the journal Nature.,Ever since the publication of our work,,we've been receiving numerous comments,from all over the Internet.,Maybe we can take a look at some of those.,["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation...nneural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"],SR: So the first thingnthat you'll notice is that people,have really strong opinionsnabout this kind of work.,Now I happen to completelynagree with the optimism,of this first quote,,because on a scalenof zero to Morgan Freeman's voice,,it happens to benone of the most evocative accolades,that I've heard come our way.,(Laughter),But as you'll see, it's notnthe only opinion that's out there.,["This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easilynin humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED"],XL: Indeed, if we takena look at the second one,,I think we can all agree that it's, meh,,probably not as positive.,But this also reminds us that,,although we are still working with mice,,it's probably a good ideanto start thinking and discussing,about the possible ethical ramifications,of memory control.,SR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote,,we want to tell you about a recentnproject that we've been,working on in lab that we've callednProject Inception.,["They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds,nso they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception."],So we reasoned that nownthat we can reactivate a memory,,what if we do so but then beginnto tinker with that memory?,Could we possibly even turnnit into a false memory?,XL: So all memorynis sophisticated and dynamic,,but if just for simplicity,nlet's imagine memory,as a movie clip.,So far what we've told younis basically we can control,this "play" button of the clip,so that we can play this videonclip any time, anywhere.,But is there a possibilitynthat we can actually get,inside the brain and edit this movie clip,so that we can make itndifferent from the original?,Yes we can.,Turned out that all we neednto do is basically,reactivate a memory usingnlasers just like we did before,,but at the same time,nif we present new information,and allow this new informationnto incorporate into this old memory,,this will change the memory.,It's sort of like making a remix tape.,SR: So how do we do this?,Rather than finding a fearnmemory in the brain,,we can start by taking our animals,,and let's say we put them in a bluenbox like this blue box here,and we find the brain cellsnthat represent that blue box,and we trick them to respondnto pulses of light,exactly like we had said before.,Now the next day, we can takenour animals and place them,in a red box that they've nevernexperienced before.,We can shoot lightninto the brain to reactivate,the memory of the blue box.,So what would happen herenif, while the animal,is recalling the memory of the blue box,,we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks?,So here we're trying to artificiallynmake an association,between the memory of the blue box,and the foot shocks themselves.,We're just trying to connect the two.,So to test if we had done so,,we can take our animals once again,and place them back in the blue box.,Again, we had just reactivatednthe memory of the blue box,while the animal got a couplenof mild foot shocks,,and now the animal suddenly freezes.,It's as though it's recalling beingnmildly shocked in this environment,even though that never actually happened.,So it formed a false memory,,because it's falselynfearing an environment,where, technically speaking,,nothing bad actually happened to it.,XL: So, so far we are only talking about,this light-controlled "on" switch.,In fact, we also havena light-controlled "off" switch,,and it's very easy to imagine that,by installing thisnlight-controlled "off" switch,,we can also turn off a memory,nany time, anywhere.,So everythingnwe've been talking about today,is based on this philosophicallyncharged principle of neuroscience,that the mind, with its seeminglynmysterious properties,,is actually made of physicalnstuff that we can tinker with.,SR: And for me personally,,I see a world where we can reactivate,any kind of memory that we'd like.,I also see a world where we cannerase unwanted memories.,Now, I even see a worldnwhere editing memories,is something of a reality,,because we're living in a timenwhere it's possible,to pluck questions from the treenof science fiction,and to ground themnin experimental reality.,XL: Nowadays, people in the lab,and people in otherngroups all over the world,are using similar methodsnto activate or edit memories,,whether that's old or new,npositive or negative,,all sorts of memories sonthat we can understand,how memory works.,SR: For example, one group in our lab,was able to find the brain cellsnthat make up a fear memory,and converted them into a pleasurablenmemory, just like that.,That's exactly what I mean about editingnthese kinds of processes.,Now one dude in labnwas even able to reactivate,memories of female mice in male mice,,which rumor has itnis a pleasurable experience.,XL: Indeed, we are livingnin a very exciting moment,where science doesn't havenany arbitrary speed limits,but is only bound by our own imagination.,SR: And finally, what donwe make of all this?,How do we push this technology forward?,These are the questionsnthat should not remain,just inside the lab,,and so one goal of today's talknwas to bring everybody,up to speed with the kindnof stuff that's possible,in modern neuroscience,,but now, just as importantly,,to actively engage everybodynin this conversation.,So let's think together as a teamnabout what this all means,and where we can and should go from here,,because Xu and I think we all have,some really big decisions ahead of us.,Thank you. XL: Thank you.,(Applause)Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that,companies, the really cool companies,,the innovative ones, the creative,,new economy-type companies --,Apple, Google, Facebook --,are coming out of one particular country,,the United States of America?,Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!,That's Europe." But, yeah.,It has not had the impact that these other companies have had. 
 Now what I do is I'm an economist,,and I actually study the relationship,between innovation and economic growth,at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,,and I work with policymakers worldwide,,especially in the European Commission,,but recently also in interesting places like China,,and I can tell you that that question,is on the tip of all of their tongues:,Where are the European Googles?,What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,,which they understand is different,from this old economy growth model?,And what is interesting is that often,,even if we're in the 21st century,,we kind of come down in the end to these ideas,of market versus state.,It's talked about in these modern ways,,but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,,the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,,the private initiative, whether this be about,a dynamic venture capital sector,that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance,to these innovative companies,,the gazelles as we often call them,,which traditional banks are scared of,,or different types of really successful,commercialization policies which actually allow these companies,to bring these great inventions, their products,,to the market and actually get over this,really scary Death Valley period,in which many companies instead fail. 
 But what really interests me, especially nowadays,and because of what's happening politically around the world,,is the language that's used, the narrative,,the discourse, the images, the actual words.,So we often are presented,with the kind of words like that the private sector,is also much more innovative because it's able to,think out of the box.,They are more dynamic.,Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech,to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,,where he said to be innovative,,you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.,Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry,and foolish and colorful guys, right?,And in places like Europe,,it might be more equitable,,we might even be a bit better dressed,and eat better than the U.S.,,but the problem is this damn public sector.,It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed,these things like dynamic venture capital,and commercialization to actually be able to really,be as fruitful as it could.,And even really respectable newspapers,,some that I'm actually subscribed to,,the words they use are, you know,,the state as this Leviathan. Right?,This monster with big tentacles.,They're very explicit in these editorials.,They say, "You know, the state, it's necessary,to fix these little market failures,when you have public goods,or different types of negative externalities like pollution,,but you know what, what is the next big revolution,going to be after the Internet?,We all hope it might be something green,,or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say --,this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --,they say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?,Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.,Even fund the basic research, because this is,popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good,which private companies don't want to invest in,,do that, but you know what?,Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.",Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.,They're often called garage tinkerers,,because some of them actually did some things in garages,,even though that's partly a myth.,And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,,only 10 minutes,,is to really think again this juxtaposition,,because it actually has massive, massive implications,beyond innovation policy,,which just happens to be the area,that I often talk with with policymakers.,It has huge implications, even with this whole notion,that we have on where, when and why,we should actually be cutting back on public spending,and different types of public services which,,of course, as we know, are increasingly being,outsourced because of this juxtaposition.,Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools,is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened,by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.,So these kind of words are constantly,,these juxtapositions come up everywhere,,not just with innovation policy. 
 And so to think again,,there's no reason that you should believe me,,so just think of some of the smartest,revolutionary things that you have in your pockets,and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.,Ask who actually funded the really cool,,revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box,things in the iPhone.,What actually makes your phone,a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?,So the Internet, which you can surf the web,anywhere you are in the world;,GPS, where you can actually know where you are,anywhere in the world;,the touchscreen display, which makes it also,a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.,These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,,and they're all government-funded.,And the point is that the Internet,was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.,GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.,Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.,The touchscreen display was funded,by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF,to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.,Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said,the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,",but what's really interesting is that this is actually true,in sector after sector and department after department.,So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally,very interested in because I've actually had the fortune,to study it in quite some depth,,is wonderful to be asking this question,about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,,because each and every medicine can actually be,divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.,So the new molecular entities with priority rating,are the revolutionary new drugs,,whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --,Viagra, different color, different dosage --,are the less revolutionary ones.,And it turns out that a full 75 percent,of the new molecular entities with priority rating,are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.,This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.,They do. They spend on the marketing part.,They spend on the D part of R&D.,They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,,which is quite problematic.,In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently,have spent more money in buying back their shares,to boost their stock price than on R&D,,but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day,I'd be fascinated to tell you about. 
 Now, what's interesting in all of this,is the state, in all these examples,,was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.,It was actually shaping and creating markets.,It was funding not only the basic research,,which again is a typical public good,,but even the applied research.,It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.,So these SBIR and SDTR programs,,which give small companies early-stage finance,have not only been extremely important,compared to private venture capital,,but also have become increasingly important.,Why? Because, as many of us know,,V.C. is actually quite short-term.,They want their returns in three to five years.,Innovation takes a much longer time than that,,15 to 20 years.,And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?,Who's actually funding the hard stuff?,Of course, it's not just the state.,The private sector does a lot.,But the narrative that we've always been told,is the state is important for the basics,,but not really providing that sort of high-risk,,revolutionary thinking out of the box.,In all these sectors, from funding the Internet,to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,,the strategic vision, for these investments,,it was actually coming within the state.,The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating,to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,,came from within government. 
 And so there's huge implications of this.,First of all, of course I'm not someone,,this old-fashioned person, market versus state.,What we all know in dynamic capitalism,is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.,But the point is, by constantly depicting,the state part as necessary,but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring,and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,,I think we've actually really stunted the possibility,to build these public-private partnerships,in a really dynamic way.,Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,,the public part -- well, they're both P's --,with public-private partnerships,is in terms of de-risking.,What the public sector did in all these examples,I just gave you, and there's many more,,which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,,is doing much more than de-risking.,It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.,It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.,But also, I'm sure you all have had experience,with local, regional, national governments,,and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.",That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.,Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.,By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,,boring, it's sometimes,that we actually create those organizations in that way.,So what we have to actually do is build,these entrepreneurial state organizations.,DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,,actually thought really hard about this,,how to welcome failure, because you will fail.,You will fail when you innovative.,One out of 10 experiments has any success.,And the V.C. guys know this,,and they're able to actually fund the other losses,from that one success. 
 And this brings me, actually, probably,,to the biggest implication,,and this has huge implications beyond innovation.,If the state is more than just a market fixer,,if it actually is a market shaper,,and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,,what happened to the reward?,We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,,the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,,and so some people are foolish enough,or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,,to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk,which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,,that whole risk-reward thing.,Well, where's the reward for the state,of having taken on these massive risks,and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?,The Internet was crazy.,It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.,You had to be completely nuts to do it,,and luckily, they were.,Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards,unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.,And the problem is that economists often think,,well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.,You know, the companies will pay tax,,the jobs they create will create growth,so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise,will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.,Well, unfortunately, that's not true.,Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.,Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.,Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.,I mean, one can take a position on that.,But also these companies,that have actually had this massive benefit from the state --,Apple's a great example.,They even got the first -- well, not the first,,but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,,through this SBIC program,,which predated the SBIR program,,as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.,And yet we know they legally,,as many other companies, pay very little tax back. 
 So what we really need to actually rethink,is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism,that's much more direct than tax. Why not?,It could happen perhaps through equity.,This, by the way, in the countries,that are actually thinking about this strategically,,countries like Finland in Scandinavia,,but also in China and Brazil,,they're retaining equity in these investments.,Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,,it's a public funding agency in Finland,,which then funded the next round of Nokias.,The Brazilian Development Bank,,which is providing huge amounts of funds today,to clean technology, they just announced,a $56 billion program for the future on this,,is retaining equity in these investments.,So to put it provocatively,,had the U.S. government thought about this,,and maybe just brought back,just something called an innovation fund,,you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent,of the profits from what the Internet produced,had come back to that innovation fund,,there would be so much more money,to spend today on green technology.,Instead, many of the state budgets,which in theory are trying to do that,are being constrained.,But perhaps even more important,,we heard before about the one percent,,the 99 percent.,If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,,as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,,because that's what we're talking about, right?,Who are the different players in creating value,in the economy, and is the state's role,,has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?,If we can actually have a broader theory,of value creation and allow us to actually admit,what the state has been doing and reap something back,,it might just be that in the next round,,and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution,will in fact be green,,that that period of growth,will not only be smart, innovation-led,,not only green, but also more inclusive,,so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley,can actually also benefit from that growth,,because they have not. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)"Iran is Israel's best friend,,and we do not intend to change our position,in relation to Tehran." 
 Believe it or not, this is a quote,from an Israeli prime minister,,but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir,from the era of the Shah.,It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.,The year is 1987.,Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,,and much like Ahmadinejad today,,he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.,Yet, Rabin referred to Iran,as a geostrategic friend. 
 Today, when we hear the threats of war,and the high rhetoric,,we're oftentimes led to believe,that this is yet another one of those unsolvable,Middle Eastern conflicts,with roots as old as the region itself.,Nothing could be further from the truth,,and I hope today to show you why that is. 
 The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people,throughout history has actually been quite positive,,starting in 539 B.C.,,when King Cyrus the Great of Persia,liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.,A third of the Jewish population,stayed in Babylonia.,They're today's Iraqi Jews.,A third migrated to Persia.,They're today's Iranian Jews,,still 25,000 of them living in Iran,,making them the largest Jewish community,in the Middle East outside of Israel itself.,And a third returned to historic Palestine,,did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,,financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money. 
 But even in modern times,,relations have been close at times.,Rabin's statement was a reflection,of decades of security and intelligence collaboration,between the two, which in turn,was born out of perception of common threats.,Both states feared the Soviet Union,and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.,And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,,the idea that Israel's security was best achieved,by creating alliances with the non-Arab states,in the periphery of the region,in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.,Now, from the Shah's perspective, though,,he wanted to keep this as secret as possible,,so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,,traveled to Iran in the '70s,,he usually wore a wig,so that no one would recognize him.,The Iranians built a special tarmac,at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,,so that no one would notice the large number,of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran. 
 Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution,in 1979?,In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology,of the new regime, the geopolitical logic,for their collaboration lived on,,because they still had common threats.,And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,,Israel feared an Iraqi victory,and actively helped Iran by selling it arms,and providing it with spare parts,for Iran's American weaponry,at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable,because of an American arms embargo,that Israel was more than happy to violate.,In fact, back in the 1980s,,it was Israel that lobbied Washington,to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,,and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.,And this, of course, climaxed,in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s. 
 But with the end of the Cold War,came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.,Suddenly, the two common threats,that had pushed them closer together throughout decades,,more or less evaporated.,The Soviet Union collapsed,,Iraq was defeated,,and a new environment was created in the region,in which both of them felt more secure,,but they were also now left unchecked.,Without Iraq balancing Iran,,Iran could now become a threat,,some in Israel argued.,In fact, the current dynamic,that you see between Iran and Israel,has its roots more so,in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region,after the Cold War,than in the events of 1979,,because at this point, Iran and Israel,emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,,and rather than viewing each other,as potential security partners,,they increasingly came to view each other,as rivals and competitors.,So Israel, who in the 1980s,lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations,now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,,thinking that it would come,at Israel's security interests' expense,,and instead sought to put Iran,in increased isolation. 
 Ironically, this was happening at a time,when Iran was more interested,in peacemaking with Washington,than to see to Israel's destruction.,Iran had put itself in isolation,because of its radicalism,,and after having helped the United States indirectly,in the war against Iraq in 1991,,the Iranians were hoping,that they would be rewarded by being included,in the post-war security architecture of the region.,But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,,as it would a decade later in Afghanistan,,and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,,and it is at this point, around 1993, '94,,that Iran begins to translate,its anti-Israeli ideology,into operational policy.,The Iranians believed that whatever they did,,even if they moderated their policies,,the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,,and the only way Iran could compel Washington,to change its position was by imposing a cost,on the U.S. if it didn't.,The easiest target was the peace process,,and now the Iranian ideological bark,was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,,and Iran began supporting extensively,Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously,had shunned.,In some ways, this sounds paradoxical,,but according to Martin Indyk,of the Clinton administration,,the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,,because the more peace there would be,between Israel and Palestine,,the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.,The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.,So according to Indyk, and these are his words,,the Iranians had an interest to do us in,on the peace process,in order to defeat our policy of containment.,To defeat our policy of containment,,not about ideology. 
 But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,,all sides have reached out to each other.,Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,,reached out to the Iranians to see,if there were any ways that,the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.,Tehran was not interested.,A few years later, the Iranians sent,a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,,a proposal that revealed that there was some potential,of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.,The Bush administration did not even respond.,All sides have never missed an opportunity,to miss an opportunity. 
 But this is not an ancient conflict.,This is not even an ideological conflict.,The ebbs and flows of hostility,have not shifted with ideological zeal,,but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.,When Iran and Israel's security imperatives,dictated collaboration, they did so,in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.,When Iran's ideological impulses collided,with its strategic interests,,the strategic interests always prevailed.,This is good news, because it means,that neither war nor enmity,is a foregone conclusion. 
 But some want war.,Some believe or say that it's 1938,,Iran is Germany,,and Ahmadinejad is Hitler.,If we accept this to be true,,that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,,Ahmadinejad is Hitler,,then the question we have to ask ourself is,,who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?,Who will risk peace?,This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed,at eliminating diplomacy,,and when you eliminate diplomacy,,you make war inevitable.,In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,,no draw, no compromise,,only victory or defeat. 
 But rather than making war inevitable,by viewing this as ideological,,we would be wise to seek ways,to make peace possible.,Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,,only a few decades old,in a history of 2,500 years,,and precisely because its roots are geopolitical,,it means that solutions can be found,,compromises can be struck,,however difficult it yet may be.,After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,,"You don't make peace with your friends.,You make it with your enemies." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)As humans, it's in our nature,to want to improve our health nand minimize our suffering.,Whatever life throws at us,,whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,,or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.,Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,,and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans,have used materials in really creative ways,in the body over time. 
 Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.,This was actually used by the Mayans,as an artificial tooth replacement.,We're not quite sure why they did it.,It's hard. It's durable.,But it also had other very nice properties.,In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,,it could integrate into the jaw,,and we know now with very sophisticated,imaging technologies,that part of that integration comes from the fact,that this material is designed,in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,,has a beautiful architecture.,And I think in many ways we can sort of think,of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans,as the first real application,of the bluetooth technology. 
 (Laughter) 
 But if we move on and think throughout history,how people have used different nmaterials in the body,,very often it's been physicians,that have been quite creative.,They've taken things off the shelf. 
 One of my favorite examples,is that of Sir Harold Ridley,,who was a famous ophthalmologist,,or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.,And during World War II, what he would see,would be pilots coming back from their missions,,and he noticed that within their eyes,they had shards of small bits of material,lodged within the eye,,but the very interesting thing about it,was that material, actually, wasn't causing,any inflammatory response.,So he looked into this, and he figured out,that actually that material was little shards of plastic,that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.,And this led him to propose that material,as a new material for intraocular lenses.,It's called PMMA, and it's now used,in millions of people every year,and helps in preventing cataracts. 
 And that example, I think, is a really nice one,,because it helps remind us that in the early days,,people often chose materials,because they were bioinert.,Their very purpose was to nperform a mechanical function.,You'd put them in the body,and you wouldn't get an adverse response.,And what I want to show you is that,in regenerative medicine,,we've really shifted away from that idea,of taking a bioinert material.,We're actually actively looking for materials,that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,,and that furthermore we can put in the body,,they'll have their function,,and then they'll dissolve away over time. 
 If we look at this schematic,,this is showing you what we think of,as the typical tissue-engineering approach.,We have cells there, typically from the patient.,We can put those onto a material,,and we can make that material nvery complex if we want to,,and we can then grow that up in the lab,or we can put it straight back into the patient.,And this is an approach that's nused all over the world,,including in our lab. 
 But one of the things that's really important,when we're thinking about stem cells,is that obviously stem cells ncan be many different things,,and they want to be many different things,,and so we want to make sure that the environment,we put them into has enough information,so that they can become the right sort,of specialist tissue.,And if we think about the different types of tissues,that people are looking at regenerating,all over the world, in all the ndifferent labs in the world,,there's pretty much every tissue you can think of.,And actually, the structure of those tissues,is quite different, and it's going to really depend,on whether your patient has any underlying disease,,other conditions, in terms of how,you're going to regenerate your tissue,,and you're going to need to think about the materials,you're going to use really carefully,,their biochemistry, their mechanics,,and many other properties as well. 
 Our tissues all have very ndifferent abilities to regenerate,,and here we see poor Prometheus,,who made a rather tricky career choice,and was punished by the Greek gods.,He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come,every day to eat his liver.,But of course his liver would regenerate every day,,and so day after day he was punished,for eternity by the gods.,And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,,but actually if we think of other tissues,,like cartilage, for example,,even the simplest nick and you're going to find it,really difficult to regenerate your cartilage.,So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue. 
 Now, bone is somewhere in between,,and this is one of the tissues nthat we work on a lot in our lab.,And bone is actually quite good at repairing.,It has to be. We've probably all had fractures,at some point or other.,And one of the ways that you can think,about repairing your fracture,is this procedure here, called nan iliac crest harvest.,And what the surgeon might do,is take some bone from your iliac crest,,which is just here,,and then transplant that nsomewhere else in the body.,And it actually works really well,,because it's your own bone,,and it's well vascularized,,which means it's got a really good blood supply.,But the problem is, there'snonly so much you can take,,and also when you do that operation,,your patients might actually have significant pain,in that defect site even two nyears after the operation. 
 So what we were thinking is,,there's a tremendous need nfor bone repair, of course,,but this iliac crest-type approach,really has a lot of limitations to it,,and could we perhaps recreate,the generation of bone within the body,on demand and then be able to transplant it,without these very, very painful aftereffects,that you would have with the iliac crest harvest? 
 And so this is what we did, and the way we did it,was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach,but actually thinking about it rather differently.,And we simplified it a lot,,so we got rid of a lot of these steps.,We got rid of the need to nharvest cells from the patient,,we got rid of the need to put nin really fancy chemistries,,and we got rid of the need,to culture these scaffolds in the lab.,And what we really focused on,was our material system and making it quite simple,,but because we used it in a really clever way,,we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone,using this approach.,So we were using the body,as really the catalyst to help us,to make lots of new bone.,And it's an approach that we call,the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make,enormous amounts of bone using this approach.,And I'll talk you through this. 
 So what we do is,,in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells,on the outside of our long bones.,That layer is called the periosteum.,And that layer is actually normally,very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,,and it's got stem cells in it.,Those stem cells are really important,in the embryo when it develops,,and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture,to help you with repairing the bone.,So we take that periosteum layer,and we developed a way to inject underneath it,a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,,would turn into quite a rigid gel,and can actually lift thenperiosteum away from the bone.,So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity,that is right next to both the bone,but also this really rich layer of stem cells.,And we go in through a pinhole incision,so that no other cells from the body can get in,,and what happens is that thatnartificial in vivo bioreactor cavity,can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,,and they can form lots of new tissue,,and then over time, you can harvest that tissue,and use it elsewhere in the body. 
 This is a histology slide,of what we see when we do that,,and essentially what we see,is very large amounts of bone.,So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,,so the bone marrow,,then you can see the original bone,,and you can see where that original bone finishes,,and just to the left of that is the new bone,that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,,and you can actually make it even larger.,And that demarcation that you can see,between the original bone and the new bone,acts as a very slight point of weakness,,so actually now the surgeon can come along,,can harvest away that new bone,,and the periosteum can grow back,,so you're left with the leg,in the same sort of state,as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.,So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain,compared to an iliac crest harvest.,And you can grow different amounts of bone,depending on how much gel you put in there,,so it really is an on demand sort of procedure. 
 Now, at the time that we did this,,this received a lot of attention in the press,,because it was a really nice way,of generating new bone,,and we got many, many contacts,from different people that nwere interested in using this.,And I'm just going to tell you,,sometimes those contacts are very strange,,slightly unexpected,,and the very most interesting,,let me put it that way, contact that I had,,was actually from a team of American footballers,that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls,made on their head. 
 And so you do get these kinds of contacts,,and of course, being British,and also growing up in France,,I tend to be very blunt,,and so I had to explain to them very nicely,that in their particular case,,there probably wasn't that much in there,to protect in the first place. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So this was our approach,,and it was simple materials,,but we thought about it carefully.,And actually we know that those cells,in the body, in the embryo, as they develop,can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,,and so we developed a gel that was slightly different,in nature and slightly different chemistry,,put it in there, and we were able to get,100 percent cartilage instead. 
 And this approach works really well, I think,,for pre-planned procedures,,but it's something you do have to pre-plan.,So for other kinds of operations,,there's definitely a need for other,scaffold-based approaches.,And when you think about designing,those other scaffolds, actually,,you need a really multi-disciplinary team.,And so our team has chemists,,it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,,and those people all come together,and we think really hard about ndesigning the materials. 
 But we want to make them have enough information,that we can get the cells to do what we want,,but not be so complex as to make it difficult,to get to clinic.,And so one of the things we think about a lot,is really trying to understand,the structure of the tissues in the body.,And so if we think of bone,,obviously my own favorite tissue,,we zoom in, we can see,,even if you don't know anything nabout bone structure,,it's beautifully organized, nreally beautifully organized.,We've lots of blood vessels in there.,And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells,are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix,of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot,of information to the cells.,And if we zoom in again,,actually in the case of bone, the matrix,around the cells is beautifully organized,at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material,that's part organic, part inorganic.,And that's led to a whole field, really,,that has looked at developing materials,that have this hybrid kind of structure.,And so I'm showing here just two examples,where we've made some materialsnthat have that sort of structure,,and you can really tailor it.,You can see here a very squishy one,and now a material that's also nthis hybrid sort of material,but actually has remarkable toughness,,and it's no longer brittle.,And an inorganic material nwould normally be really brittle,,and you wouldn't be able to have,that sort of strength and toughness in it. 
 One other thing I want to quickly mention is that,many of the scaffolds we make nare porous, and they have to be,,because you want blood vessels to grow in there.,But the pores are actually oftentimes,much bigger than the cells,,and so even though it's 3D,,the cell might see it more nas a slightly curved surface,,and that's a little bit unnatural.,And so one of the things you can think about doing,is actually making scaffolds nwith slightly different dimensions,that might be able to surround your cells in 3D,and give them a little bit more information.,And there's a lot of work going non in both of these areas. 
 Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about,applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,,because this is a really big clinical problem.,And one of the things that we know is that,,unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,,then that tissue can start to die,,and your outcome may not be very good over time.,And it would be really great, actually,,if we could stop that dead tissue,either from dying or help it to regenerate.,And there's lots and lots of stem ncell trials going on worldwide,,and they use many different types of cells,,but one common theme that seems to be coming out,is that actually, very often, those cells will die,once you've implanted them.,And you can either put them into the heart,or into the blood system,,but either way, we don't seem to be able,to get quite the right number of cells,getting to the location we want them to,and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful,cell regeneration that we would like to have,to get good clinical outcomes. 
 And so some of the things that we're thinking of,,and many other people in the field are thinking of,,are actually developing materials for that.,But there's a difference here.,We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,,we still need really interesting topography,,and we still need really interesting nways to surround the cells.,But now, the cells also,would probably quite like a material,that's going to be able to be conductive,,because the cells themselves will respond very well,and will actually conduct signals nbetween themselves.,You can see them now,beating synchronously on these materials,,and that's a very, very exciting development,that's going on. 
 So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that,being able to work in this sort of field,,all of us that work in this field,that's not only super-exciting science,,but also has the potential,to impact on patients,,however big or small they are,,is really a great privilege.,And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was a young man, I spent six years,of wild adventure in the tropics,working as an investigative journalist,in some of the most bewitching parts of the world.,I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.,This is why wars get fought.,But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.,And when I came home, I found the scope of my existence,gradually diminishing,until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.,And I found myself sort of,scratching at the walls of life,,as if I was trying to find a way out,into a wider space beyond.,I was, I believe, ecologically bored. 
 Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,,in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.,And we still possess the fear and the courage,and the aggression required to navigate those times.,But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,,we have few opportunities to exercise them,without harming other people.,And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself,bumping up against.,To conquer uncertainty,,to know what comes next,,that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,,and having got there, or almost got there,,we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.,We've privileged safety over experience,and we've gained a lot in doing so,,but I think we've lost something too. 
 Now, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.,I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,,and the outcome of a mortal combat between me,myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear,and an enraged giant aurochs,isn't very hard to predict.,Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for.,I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.,I just wanted a richer and rawer life,than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,,that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world. 
 And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word,that I began to understand what I was looking for.,And as soon as I found that word,,I realized that I wanted to devote,much of the rest of my life to it. 
 The word is "rewilding,",and even though rewilding is a young word,,it already has several definitions.,But there are two in particular that fascinate me.,The first one is the mass restoration,of ecosystems. 
 One of the most exciting scientific findings,of the past half century,has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.,A trophic cascade is an ecological process,which starts at the top of the food chain,and tumbles all the way down to the bottom,,and the classic example is what happened,in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States,when wolves were reintroduced in 1995.,Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,,but perhaps we're slightly less aware,that they give life to many others.,It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.,Before the wolves turned up,,they'd been absent for 70 years.,The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,,had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,,and despite efforts by humans to control them,,they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there,to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.,But as soon as the wolves arrived,,even though they were few in number,,they started to have the most remarkable effects.,First, of course, they killed some of the deer,,but that wasn't the major thing.,Much more significantly,,they radically changed the behavior of the deer.,The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,,the places where they could be trapped most easily,,particularly the valleys and the gorges,,and immediately those places started to regenerate.,In some areas, the height of the trees,quintupled in just six years.,Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen,and willow and cottonwood.,And as soon as that happened,,the birds started moving in.,The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,,started to increase greatly.,The number of beavers started to increase,,because beavers like to eat the trees.,And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.,They create niches for other species.,And the dams they built in the rivers,provided habitats for otters and muskrats,and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.,The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,,the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,,which meant more hawks, more weasels,,more foxes, more badgers.,Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed,on the carrion that the wolves had left.,Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,,partly also because there were more berries,growing on the regenerating shrubs,,and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves,by killing some of the calves of the deer. 
 But here's where it gets really interesting.,The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.,They began to meander less.,There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.,More pools formed, more riffle sections,,all of which were great for wildlife habitats.,The rivers changed,in response to the wolves,,and the reason was that the regenerating forests,stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,,so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.,Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places,and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,,there was less soil erosion,,because the vegetation stabilized that as well.,So the wolves, small in number,,transformed not just the ecosystem,of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,,but also its physical geography. 
 Whales in the southern oceans,have similarly wide-ranging effects.,One of the many post-rational excuses,made by the Japanese government for killing whales,is that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise,and then there'll be more for people to eat.",Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of,kind of makes sense, doesn't it,,because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts,of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,,there'll be more fish and krill.,But the opposite happened.,You take the whales away,,and the number of krill collapses.,Why would that possibly have happened?,Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial,to sustaining that entire ecosystem,,and one of the reasons for this,is that they often feed at depth,and then they come up to the surface and produce,what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,,huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,,up in the photic zone, where there's enough light,to allow photosynthesis to take place,,and those great plumes of fertilizer,stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,,the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,,which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,,which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.,The other thing that whales do is that,,as they're plunging up and down through the water column,,they're kicking the phytoplankton,back up towards the surface,where it can continue to survive and reproduce.,And interestingly, well, we know,that plant plankton in the oceans,absorb carbon from the atmosphere --,the more plant plankton there are,,the more carbon they absorb --,and eventually they filter down into the abyss,and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.,Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,,they were probably responsible for sequestering,some tens of millions of tons of carbon,every year from the atmosphere. 
 And when you look at it like that, you think,,wait a minute, here are the wolves,changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.,Here are the whales changing,the composition of the atmosphere.,You begin to see that possibly,,the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,,which conceives of the world as a coherent,,self-regulating organism,,is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate. 
 Trophic cascades,tell us that the natural world,is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.,They tell us that when you take away the large animals,,you are left with a radically different ecosystem,to one which retains its large animals.,And they make, in my view, a powerful case,for the reintroduction of missing species.,Rewilding, to me,,means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.,It means taking down the fences,,it means blocking the drainage ditches,,it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,,but otherwise stepping back.,It has no view as to what a right ecosystem,or a right assemblage of species looks like.,It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow,or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.,It lets nature decide,,and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding. 
 Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions,of rewilding that interest me.,The other one,is the rewilding of human life.,And I don't see this as an alternative,to civilization.,I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,,as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,,have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure,when we want to because,there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats. 
 And the opportunities for this,are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.,There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,,two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared,has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,,particularly from the eastern half of the country.,There's another one which suggests,that 30 million hectares of land in Europe,,an area the size of Poland,,will be vacated by farmers,between 2000 and 2030. 
 Now, faced with opportunities like that,,does it not seem a little unambitious,to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,,bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,,and all the other species which are already beginning,to move quite rapidly across Europe?,Perhaps we should also start thinking,about the return of some of our lost megafauna. 
 What megafauna, you say?,Well, every continent had one,,apart from Antarctica.,When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,,the river gravels there were found,to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,,rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.,Yes, ladies and gentlemen,,there were lions in Trafalgar Square,long before Nelson's Column was built.,All these species lived here,in the last interglacial period,,when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.,It's not climate, largely,,which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.,It's pressure from the human population,hunting and destroying their habitats,which has done so. 
 And even so, you can still see the shadows,of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.,Why is it that so many deciduous trees,are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?,Why is it that they can withstand the loss,of so much of their bark?,Why do understory trees,,which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind,and have to carry less weight,than the big canopy trees,,why are they so much tougher and harder to break,than the canopy trees are?,Elephants.,They are elephant-adapted.,In Europe, for example,,they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,,elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.,It was related to the Asian elephant,,but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.,It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.,But why is it that some of our common shrubs,have spines which seem to be over-engineered,to resist browsing by deer?,Perhaps because they evolved,to resist browsing by rhinoceros. 
 Isn't it an amazing thought,that every time you wander into a park,or down an avenue or through a leafy street,,you can see the shadows of these great beasts?,Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,,crucial to an understanding of our own,,feels like a portal through which you may pass,into an enchanted kingdom.,And if we really are looking at areas of land,of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,,why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,,or at least species closely related to those,which have become extinct everywhere?,Why shouldn't all of us,have a Serengeti on our doorsteps? 
 And perhaps this is the most important thing,that rewilding offers us,,the most important thing that's missing from our lives:,hope.,In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,,an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.,The story rewilding tells us,is that ecological change need not always proceed,in one direction.,It offers us the hope,that our silent spring,could be replaced by a raucous summer. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When I was about three or four years old,,I remember my mum reading a story to me,and my two big brothers,,and I remember putting up my hands,to feel the page of the book,,to feel the picture they were discussing. 
 And my mum said, "Darling,,remember that you can't see,and you can't feel the picture,and you can't feel the print on the page." 
 And I thought to myself,,"But that's what I want to do.,I love stories. I want to read.",Little did I know,that I would be part of a technological revolution,that would make that dream come true. 
 I was born premature by about 10 weeks,,which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.,The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,,and it's now very rare in the developed world.,Little did I know, lying curled up,in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948,that I'd been born at the right place,and the right time,,that I was in a country where I could participate,in the technological revolution. 
 There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,,but those of us who've shared in the technological changes,mainly come from North America, Europe,,Japan and other developed parts of the world.,Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room,and around the world,,but I think they've changed the lives,of we blind people more than any other group.,And so I want to tell you about the interaction,between computer-based adaptive technology,and the many volunteers who helped me over the years,to become the person I am today.,It's an interaction between volunteers,,passionate inventors and technology,,and it's a story that many other blind people could tell.,But let me tell you a bit about it today. 
 When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.,It's an ingenious system of six dots,that are punched into paper,,and I can feel them with my fingers.,In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.,I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.,(Laughter),I was pretty good in reading,,but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.,(Laughter) 
 When you leave the opera house,,you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.,Look for it. Have you noticed it?,I do. I look for it all the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was at school,,the books were transcribed by transcribers,,voluntary people who punched one dot at a time,so I'd have volumes to read,,and that had been going on, mainly by women,,since the late 19th century in this country,,but it was the only way I could read.,When I was in high school,,I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,,and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer,medium of learning.,I could have family and friends read me material,,and I could then read it back,as many times as I needed.,And it brought me into contact,with volunteers and helpers.,For example, when I studied at graduate school,at Queen's University in Canada,,the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.,I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.,As one of them said to me,,"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment." 
 (Laughter) 
 But think of it. These men,,who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,,helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law,by their dedicated help. 
 Well, I went back and became an academic,at Melbourne's Monash University,,and for those 25 years,,tape recorders were everything to me.,In fact, in my office in 1990,,I had 18 miles of tape.,Students, family and friends all read me material.,Mrs. Lois Doery,,whom I later came to call my surrogate mum,,read me many thousands of hours onto tape.,One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today,was that I was hoping that Lois would be here,so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.,But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.,But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform. 
 (Applause) 
 I saw my first Apple computer in 1984,,and I thought to myself,,"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me.",How very wrong I was.,In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,,I got my first blind computer,,and it's actually here.,See it up there?,And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.,(Laughter),It's a blind computer.,(Laughter),It's a Keynote Gold 84k,,and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.,(Laughter),Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter),I think there's more memory in my watch. 
 It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor,in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.,Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,,but his memory lives on in my heart.,It meant, for the first time,,I could read back what I had typed into it.,It had a speech synthesizer.,I'd written my first coauthored labor law book,on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.,This now allowed me to read back what I'd written,and to enter the computer world,,even with its 84k of memory. 
 In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,,worked on building a machine that would scan books,and read them out in synthetic speech.,Optical character recognition units then,only operated usually on one font,,but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners,and speech synthesizers,,he developed a machine that could read any font.,And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,,was launched on the 13th of January, 1976.,I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil,in March 1989, and it blew me away,,and in September 1989,,the month that my associate professorship,at Monash University was announced,,the law school got one, and I could use it.,For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read,by putting a book on the scanner.,I didn't have to be nice to people! 
 (Laughter) 
 I no longer would be censored.,For example, I was too shy then,,and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody,to read me out loud sexually explicit material.,(Laughter),But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply,a program on my laptop.,That's what it's shrunk to.,And now I can scan the latest novel,and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.,I can keep up with my friends. 
 There are many people who have helped me in my life,,and many that I haven't met.,One is another American inventor Ted Henter.,Ted was a motorcycle racer,,but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,,which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.,He then turned to being a waterskier,and was a champion disabled waterskier.,But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce,to develop a program that would read out,what was on the computer screen,from the Net or from what was on the computer.,It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,,and it sounds like this. 
 (JAWS speaking) 
 Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow? 
 (Laughter),You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.,I slowed it down for you.,I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.,Can we play that one? 
 (JAWS speaking) 
 (Laughter) 
 RM: You know, when you're marking student essays,,you want to get through them fairly quickly. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 This technology that fascinated me in 1987,is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.,But, you know, I find reading with machines,a very lonely process.,I grew up with family, friends, reading to me,,and I loved the warmth and the breath,and the closeness of people reading.,Do you love being read to?,And one of my most enduring memories,is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children,down near Manly Beach,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.",Isn't that a great book?,I still love being close to someone reading to me.,But I wouldn't give up the technology,,because it's allowed me to lead a great life. 
 Of course, talking books for the blind,predated all this technology.,After all, the long-playing record was developed,in the early 1930s,,and now we put talking books on CDs,using the digital access system known as DAISY.,But when I'm reading with synthetic voices,,I love to come home and read a racy novel,with a real voice. 
 Now there are still barriers,in front of we people with disabilities.,Many websites we can't read using JAWS,and the other technologies.,Websites are often very visual,,and there are all these sorts of graphs,that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,,and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,,known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards,for the Internet.,And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners,to make their sites compatible so that,we persons without vision can have a level playing field.,There are other barriers brought about by our laws.,For example, Australia,,like about one third of the world's countries,,has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled,or read for we blind persons.,But those books can't travel across borders.,For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000,accessible books in Spanish.,In Argentina, there are 50,000.,In no other Latin American country,are there more than a couple of thousand.,But it's not legal to transport the books,from Spain to Latin America.,There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books,in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,,but they can't be transported to the 60 countries,in our world where English is the first and the second language.,And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.,Well, because we can't transport books across borders,,there had to be separate versions read,in all the different English-speaking countries:,Britain, United States, Canada, Australia,,and New Zealand all had to have,separate readings of Harry Potter. 
 And that's why, next month in Morocco,,a meeting is taking place between all the countries.,It's something that a group of countries,and the World Blind Union are advocating,,a cross-border treaty,so that if books are available under a copyright exception,and the other country has a copyright exception,,we can transport those books across borders,and give life to people, particularly in developing countries,,blind people who don't have the books to read.,I want that to happen. 
 (Applause) 
 My life has been extraordinarily blessed,with marriage and children,and certainly interesting work to do,,whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,,where I served a term as dean,,or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee,on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.,I've indeed been a very fortunate human being. 
 I wonder what the future will hold.,The technology will advance even further,,but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,,"Remember, darling,,you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers.",I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,,volunteer readers and passionate inventors,,has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me,and for blind people throughout the world. 
 I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,,who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,,and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,,is coming on to collect me.,I want to thank her too. 
 I think I have to say goodbye now.,Bless you. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),Yay! (Applause),Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause)So in my free time outside of Twitter,I experiment a little bit,with telling stories online, experimenting,with what we can do with new digital tools.,And in my job at Twitter,,I actually spent a little bit of time,working with authors and storytellers as well,,helping to expand out the bounds,of what people are experimenting with.,And I want to talk through some examples today,of things that people have done,that I think are really fascinating,using flexible identity and anonymity on the web,and blurring the lines between fact and fiction. 
 But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.,Long before a little thing called Twitter,,radio brought us broadcasts,and connected millions of people,to single points of broadcast.,And from those single points emanated stories.,Some of them were familiar stories.,Some of them were new stories.,And for a while they were familiar formats,,but then radio began to evolve its own,unique formats specific to that medium.,Think about episodes that happened live on radio. 
 Combining the live play,and the serialization of written fiction,,you get this new format.,And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think,radio is a great example of how a new medium,defines new formats which then define new stories. 
 And of course, today, we have an entirely new,medium to play with,,which is this online world.,This is the map of verified users on Twitter,and the connections between them.,There are thousands upon thousands of them.,Every single one of these points,is its own broadcaster.,We've gone to this world of many to many,,where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.,And I think that we should start to see,wildly new formats emerge,as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.,I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier,for creative experimentation, if you will,,that we've explored and begun to settle,this wild land of the Internet,and are now just getting ready,to start to build structures on it,,and those structures are the new formats,of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. 
 I believe this starts with an evolution,of existing methods.,The short story, for example,,people are saying that the short story,is experiencing a renaissance of sorts,thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.,One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented,with short stories on Amazon,by releasing one very short story called "Wool.",And he actually says that he didn't intend,for "Wool" to become a series,,but that the audience loved the first story so much,they demanded more, and so he gave them more.,He gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,,"Wool 3," which was even longer,,culminating in "Wool 5,",which was a 60,000-word novel.,I think Howey was able to do all of this because,he had the quick feedback system of e-books.,He was able to write and publish,in relatively short order.,There was no mediator between him and the audience.,It was just him directly connected with his audience,and building on the feedback and enthusiasm,that they were giving him.,So this whole project was an experiment.,It started with the one short story,,and I think the experimentation actually became,a part of Howey's format.,And that's something that this medium enabled,,was experimentation being a part of the format itself. 
 This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan,called "Black Box.",It was originally written,specifically with Twitter in mind.,Egan convinced The New Yorker,to start a New Yorker fiction account,from which they could tweet,all of these lines that she created.,Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.,Egan mocked that up just writing manually,in this storyboard sketchbook,,used the physical space constraints,of those storyboard squares,to write each individual tweet,,and those tweets ended up becoming,over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.,Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in,to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.,I think that's pretty exciting:,tune-in literary fiction.,The experience of Egan's story, of course,,like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.,You could scroll back through it,,but interestingly, if you were watching it live,,there was this suspense that built,because the actual tweets,,you had no control over when you would read them.,They were coming at a pretty regular clip,,but as the story was building,,normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,,but in this case, The New Yorker did,,and they were sending you bit by bit by bit,,and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line. 
 Another great example of fiction,and the short story on Twitter,,Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence.",It began with this tweet: "On November 28,at 10:13 p.m.,,a woman identified as Miranda Brown,,44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death,from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.",It begins in Elliott's voice,,but then Elliott's voice recedes,,and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,,characters that Elliott created on Twitter,specifically to tell this story,,a story from multiple perspectives,leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.,when this woman falls to her death.,These three characters brought an authentic vision,from multiple perspectives.,One reviewer called Elliott's story,"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.,She captured that voice,and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.,Interestingly, though, it wasn't just,Twitter as a distribution mechanism.,It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.,Elliott told me later,she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.,She laid on the couch and just went back and forth,between different characters,tweeting out each line, line by line.,I think that this kind of spontaneous creation,of what was coming out of the characters' voices,really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,,but also to this format that she had created,of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter. 
 As you begin to play with flexible identity online,,it gets even more interesting,as you start to interact with the real world.,Things like Invisible Obama,or the famous "binders full of women",that came up during the 2012 election cycle,,or even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter,in which you have all of these accounts,for every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,",including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window,in one single episode. (Laughter) 
 All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.,They are creative people experimenting,with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.,You look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,,in which you have these fictional characters,that engage with the real world.,They comment on politics,,they cry out against the evils of Congress.,Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.,And they engage with the real world.,They respond to it.,So once you take flexible identity,,anonymity, engagement with the real world,,and you move beyond simple homage or parody,and you put these tools to work in telling a story,,that's when things get really interesting. 
 So during the Chicago mayoral election,there was a parody account.,It was Mayor Emanuel.,It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,,particularly in the expletive department.,This foul-mouthed account,followed the daily activities of the race,,providing commentary as it went.,It followed all of the natural tropes,of a good, solid Twitter parody account,,but then started to get weird.,And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary,to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic,in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,,engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,,which is -- it didn't actually happen.,I double checked the newspapers. 
 And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.,This is something that doesn't usually happen,with a Twitter parody account.,It ended, a true narrative conclusion.,And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,,who was completely anonymous this whole time,,I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him,to turn this into a book,,because it was a narrative format in the end,,and I think that turning it into a book,is representative of this idea that he had created something new,that needed to be translated into previous formats. 
 One of my favorite examples,of something that's happening on Twitter right now,,actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.,Crimer Show tells the story,of a supercriminal and a hapless detective,that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,,with all of the tropes of a television show.,Crimer Show's creator has said that,it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,,but, man, is it weird.,And there are all these times where Crimer,,the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.,He's always taking off his sunglasses,or turning to the camera,,but these things just happen in text.,I think borrowing all of these tropes from television,and additionally presenting each Crimer Show,as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,",presenting them as episodes,really, it creates something new.,There is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show,on Twitter pretty much every day,,and they're archived that way.,And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.,Something totally new has been created here,out of parodying something on television. 
 I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,,there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.,RealTimeWWII is an account,that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago,in exceptional detail, as if,you were reading the news reports from that day.,And the author Teju Cole has done,a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist,on events of the news.,In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.,I think that in both of these examples,,you're beginning to see ways in which,people are telling stories with nonfiction content,that can be built into new types,of fictional storytelling. 
 So with real-time storytelling,,blurring the lines between fact and fiction,,the real world and the digital world,,flexible identity, anonymity,,these are all tools that we have accessible to us,,and I think that they're just the building blocks.,They are the bits that we use,to create the structures, the frames,,that then become our settlements on this,wide open frontier for creative experimentation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm very pleased to be here today,to talk to you all about how we might repair,the damaged brain,,and I'm particularly excited by this field,,because as a neurologist myself,,I believe that this offers one of the great ways,that we might be able to offer hope,for patients who today live with devastating,and yet untreatable diseases of the brain. 
 So here's the problem.,You can see here the picture of somebody's brain,with Alzheimer's disease,next to a healthy brain,,and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,,ringed red, there's obviousndamage -- atrophy, scarring.,And I could show you equivalent pictures,from other disease: multiple sclerosis,,motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,,even Huntington's disease,,and they would all tell a similar story.,And collectively these brain disorders represent,one of the major public health threats of our time.,And the numbers here are really rather staggering.,At any one time, there are 35 million people today,living with one of these brain diseases,,and the annual cost globally,is 700 billion dollars.,I mean, just think about that.,That's greater than one percent,of the global GDP.,And it gets worse,,because all these numbers are rising,because these are by and large,age-related diseases, and we're living longer.,So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,,why, given the devastating impact of these diseases,to the individual,,never mind the scale of the societal problem,,why are there no effective treatments? 
 Now in order to consider this,,I first need to give you a crash course,in how the brain works.,So in other words, I need to tell you,everything I learned at medical school.,(Laughter),But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.,Okay? (Laughter),So the brain is terribly simple:,it's made up of four cells,,and two of them are shown here.,There's the nerve cell,,and then there's the myelinating cell,,or the insulating cell.,It's called oligodendrocyte.,And when these four cells work together,in health and harmony,,they create an extraordinarynsymphony of electrical activity,,and it is this electrical activity,that underpins our ability to think, to emote,,to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.,But equally, each of these individual four cells,alone or together, can go rogue or die,,and when that happens, you get damage.,You get damaged wiring.,You get disrupted connections.,And that's evident here with the slower conduction.,But ultimately, this damage will manifest,as disease, clearly.,And if the starting dying nerve cell,is a motor nerve, for example,,you'll get motor neuron disease. 
 So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration,of what happens with motor neuron disease.,So this is a patient of mine called John.,John I saw just last week in the clinic.,And I've asked John to tell us something nabout what were his problems,that led to the initial diagnosis,of motor neuron disease. 
 John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,,and the main problem was a breathing problem,,difficulty breathing. 
 Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if youncaught all of that, but what John was telling us,was that difficulty with breathing,led eventually to the diagnosis,of motor neuron disease. 
 So John's now 18 monthsnfurther down in that journey,,and I've now asked him to tell us something about,his current predicament. 
 John: What I've got now is nthe breathing's gotten worse.,I've got weakness in my hands, nmy arms and my legs.,So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time. 
 SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair,most of the time. 
 So what these two clips show,is not just the devastatingnconsequence of the disease,,but they also tell us something about,the shocking pace of the disease,,because in just 18 months,,a fit adult man has been rendered,wheelchair- and respirator-dependent.,And let's face it, John could be anybody's father,,brother or friend. 
 So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.,But what happens when that myelin cell dies?,You get multiple sclerosis.,So the scan on your left,is an illustration of the brain,,and it's a map of the connections of the brain,,and superimposed upon which,are areas of damage.,We call them lesions of demyelination.,But they're damage, and they're white. 
 So I know what you're thinking here.,You're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up,and said he's going to talk about hope,,and all he's done is give a really rather bleak,and depressing tale.",I've told you these diseases are terrible.,They're devastating, numbers are rising,,the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,,we have no treatment. Where's the hope? 
 Well, you know what? I think there is hope.,And there's hope in this next section,,of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,,because what it illustrates,is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.,It just doesn't do it well enough.,And so again, there are twonthings I want to show you.,First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.,And again, it's another one of these white masses.,But crucially, the area that's ringed red,highlights an area that is pale blue.,But that area that is pale blue was once white.,So it was damaged. It's now repaired.,Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.,It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.,This is spontaneous repair.,It's amazing and it's occurred,because there are stem cells in the brain, even,,which can enable new myelin, new insulation,,to be laid down over the damaged nerves.,And this observation is important for two reasons.,The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies,that we learnt at medical school,,or at least I did, admittedly last century,,which is that the brain doesn't repair itself,,unlike, say, the bone or the liver.,But actually it does, but itnjust doesn't do it well enough.,And the second thing it does,,and it gives us a very clear direction nof travel for new therapies --,I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist,to know what to do here.,You simply need to find ways of promoting,the endogenous, spontaneousnrepair that occurs anyway. 
 So the question is, why, if we've known that,for some time, as we have,,why do we not have those treatments?,And that in part reflects the complexity,of drug development.,Now, drug development you might think of,as a rather expensive but risky bet,,and the odds of this bet are roughly this:,they're 10,000 to one against,,because you need to screennabout 10,000 compounds,to find that one potential winner.,And then you need to spend 15 years,and spend over a billion dollars,,and even then, you may not have a winner. 
 So the question for us is,,can you change the rules of the game,and can you shorten the odds?,And in order to do that, you have to think,,where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?,And one of the bottlenecks is nearly in drug discovery.,All that screening occurs in animal models.,But we know that the proper nstudy of mankind is man,,to borrow from Alexander Pope.,So the question is, can we study these diseases,using human material?,And of course, absolutely we can.,We can use stem cells,,and specifically we can use human stem cells.,And human stem cells are these extraordinary,but simple cells that can do two things:,they can self-renew or make more of themselves,,but they can also become specialized,to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,,maybe even the motor nerve cell,or the myelin cell.,And the challenge has long been,,can we harness the power,,the undoubted power of these stem cells,in order to realize their promise,for regenerative neurology? 
 And I think we can now, and the reason we can,is because there have beennseveral major discoveries,in the last 10, 20 years.,One of them was here in Edinburgh,,and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.,So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,,and Dolly was an example,of the first cloning of a mammal,from an adult cell.,But I think the even more significant breakthrough,for the purposes of our discussion today,was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist,called Yamanaka.,And what Yamaka did,,in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,,was he showed that four ingredients,,just four ingredients,,could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,,into a master stem cell.,And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,,because what it means thatnfrom anybody in this room,,but particularly patients,,you could now generate,a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.,Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,,so you could then make those cells,that are relevant to their disease,,both to study but potentially to treat.,Now, the idea of that at medical school --,this is a recurring theme, isn't nit, me and medical school? —,would have been ridiculous,,but it's an absolute reality today.,And I see this as the cornerstone,of regeneration, repair and hope. 
 And whilst we're on the theme of hope,,for those of you who might have failed at school,,there's hope for you as well,,because this is the school report of John Gerdon.,["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;non his present showing this is quite ridiculous."],So they didn't think much of him then.,But what you may not know is that he ngot the Nobel Prize for medicine,just three months ago. 
 So to return to the original problem,,what is the opportunity of these stem cells,,or this disruptive technology,,for repairing the damaged brain,,which we call regenerative neurology?,I think there are two ways you can think about this:,as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,,and/or as a form of therapy.,So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those,in the next few moments. 
 Drug discovery in a dish is how people often,talk about this.,It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,,let's say motor neuron disease,,you take a skin sample,,you do the pluripotent reprogramming,,as I've already told you,,and you generate live motor nerve cells.,That's straightforward, because that's what,pluripotent cells can do.,But crucially, you can then compare their behavior,to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,,ideally from an unaffected relative.,That way, you're matching for genetic variation. 
 And that's exactly what we did here.,This was a collaboration with colleagues:,in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., nSteve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.,And what you're looking at, and this is amazing,,these are living, growing, motor nerve cells,from a patient with motor neuron disease.,It happens to be an inherited form.,I mean, just imagine that.,This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.,So apart from seeing themngrow and put out processes,,we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,,but crucially, we can thenntrack their individual health,and compare the diseased motor nerve cells,to the healthy ones.,And when you do all that and put it together,,you realize that the diseased ones,,which is represented in the red line,,are two and a half times more likely to die,than the healthy counterpart.,And the crucial point about this is that you then have,a fantastic assay to discover drugs,,because what would you ask of the drugs,,and you could do this through a high-throughput,automated screening system,,you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:,find me a drug that will bring the red line,closer to the blue line,,because that drug will be a high-value candidate,that you could probably take direct to human trial,and almost bypass that bottleneck,that I've told you about in drug discovery,with the animal models,,if that makes sense. It's fantastic. 
 But I want to come back,to how you might use stem cells directly,to repair damage.,And again there are two ways to think about this,,and they're not mutually exclusive.,The first, and I think in the long run,the one that will give us the biggest dividend,,but it's not thought of that way just yet,,is to think about those stem cells that are already,in your brain, and I've told you that.,All of us have stem cells in the brain,,even the diseased brain,,and surely the smart way forward,is to find ways that you can promote and activate,those stem cells in your brain already,to react and respond appropriately to damage,to repair it.,That will be the future.,There will be drugs that will do that. 
 But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,,transplant them in,,to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.,And I want to tell you now an experiment,,it's a clinical trial that we did,,which recently completed,,which is with colleagues in UCL,,David Miller in particular.,So this study was very simple.,We took patients with multiple sclerosis,and asked a simple question:,Would stem cells from the bone marrow,be protective of their nerves?,So what we did was we took this bone marrow,,grew up the stem cells in the lab,,and then injected them back into the vein.,I'm making this sound really simple.,It took five years off a lot of people, okay?,And it put gray hair on me,and caused all kinds of issues.,But conceptually, it's essentially simple.,So we've given them into the vein, right?,So in order to measure whethernthis was successful or not,,we measured the optic nerve,as our outcome measure.,And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,,because patients with M.S. sadly suffer,with problems with vision --,loss of vision, unclear vision.,And so we measured the size of the optic nerve,using the scans with David Miller,three times -- 12 months, six months,,and before the infusion --,and you can see the gently declining red line.,And that's telling you thatnthe optic nerve is shrinking,,which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.,We then gave the stem cell infusion,and repeated the measurement twice --,three months and six months --,and to our surprise, almost,,the line's gone up.,That suggests that the intervention,has been protective.,I don't think myself that what's happened,is that those stem cells have made new myelin,or new nerves.,What I think they've done is they've promoted,the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,,to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.,So this is a proof of concept.,I'm very excited about that. 
 So I just want to end with the theme I began on,,which was regeneration and hope.,So here I've asked John,what his hopes are for the future. 
 John: I would hope that,sometime in the future,through the research that you people are doing,,we can come up with a cure,so that people like me can lead a normal life. 
 SC: I mean, that speaks volumes. 
 But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --,thanking John for allowing me to share,his insights and these clips with you all.,But I'd also like to add to John and to others,that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.,I do believe that the disruptive technologies,like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you,do offer very real hope.,And I do think that the day that we might be able,to repair the damaged brain,is sooner than we think.,Thank you.,(Applause)Let me start by asking you anquestion, just with a show of hands:,Who has an iPhone?,Who has an Android phone?,Who has a Blackberry?,Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?,(Laughter) 
 And let me guess, how many of you,,when you arrived here, like me, went and bought,a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?,I'll bet you didn't even know,you're using African technology.,Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,,pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom,a good 15 years ago,,and now, like franchising,,pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces,of economic activity in the world. 
 So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,,which I think is the purest form,,innovation out of necessity.,But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.,You don't have to put your hands up.,These are rhetorical. 
 Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent,the alternating current that powers the lights,in this building or the city that we're in? 
 Why did Henry Ford have toninvent the production line,to produce these Fords that came in anything,as long as they were black? 
 And why did Eric Merrifieldnhave to invent the dolos?,Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,,and in the background, you can see Robben Island.,This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield,is the most famous inventor you've never heard of.,In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor,in a small South African town called East London,,and while he was watching his kids playing,with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,,he had the idea for this.,It's a bit like a huge jumping jack,,and they have used this in every harbor in the world,as a breakwater.,The global shipping economy would not be possible,without African technology like this. 
 So whenever you talk about Africa,,you have to put up this picturenof the world from space,,and people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent.",Actually, it isn't.,What it is is a map of innovation.,And it's really easy to seenwhere innovation's going on.,All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.,(Laughter),(Applause),And the reason it isn't is because everybody's,watching television or playing Angry Birds.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So where it's happening is in Africa.,Now, this is real innovation,,not the way people have expropriated the word,to talk about launching new products.,This is real innovation, and Indefine it as problem-solving.,People are solving real problems in Africa.,Why? Because we have to.,Because we have real problems.,And when we solve real problems for people,,we solve them for the rest of the world,at the same time. 
 So in California, everybody's really excited,about a little square of plasticnthat you plug into a phone,and you can swipe your credit card,,and people say, "We've liberated the credit card,from the point of sale terminal.",Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?,In Africa, we've been doing that for years,,and we've been doing it on phones like this.,This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,,about an hour south of Nairobi,,and the thing that's so remarkablenabout the payment system,that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa,is that it works on phones like this.,It works on every single phone possible,,because it uses SMS.,You can pay bills with it, nyou can buy your groceries,,you can pay your kids' school fees,,and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.,(Laughter),Something like 25 million dollars a day,is transacted through M-Pesa.,Forty percent of Kenya's GDP,moves through M-Pesa using phones like this. 
 And you think this is just a feature phone.,Actually it's the smartphone of Africa.,It's also a radio, and it's also a torch,,and more than anything else,,it has really superb battery life.,Why? Because that's what we need.,We have really severe energy problems in Africa.,By the way, you can update Facebook,and send Gmail from a phone like this. 
 So we have found a way to use,the available technology to send money via M-Pesa,,which is a bit like a check system,for the mobile age.,I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.,It's built on gold.,This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.,And the difference today is that nthe gold of today is mobile.,If you think about the railroad systemnin North America and how that worked,,first came the infrastructure,,then came the industry around it, the brothels --,it's a bit like the Internet today, right? —,and everything else that worked with it:,bars, saloons, etc.,The gold of today is mobile,,and mobile is the enablernthat makes all of this possible. 
 So what are some of thenthings that you can do with it?,Well, this is by a guy callednBright Simons from Ghana,,and what you do is you take medication,,something that some people mightnspend their entire month's salary on,,and you scratch off the code,,and you send that to an SMS number,,and it tells you if that is legitimate,or if it's expired.,Really simple, really effective, really life-saving.,In Kenya, there's a service called iCow,,which just sends you really important information,about how to look after your dairy.,The dairy business in Kenya,is a $463 million business,,and the difference between a subsistence farmer,and an abundance farmer,is only a couple of liters of milk a day.,And if you can do that,nyou can rise out of poverty.,Really simple, using a basic phone.,If you don't have electricity, no problem!,We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts,using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.,There's another great African that you've heard,that's busy disrupting thenautomobile industry in the world.,He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power,and the electricity industry in North America,,and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,,hopefully in my lifetime.,He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],,about 50 kilometers from where I live.,So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,,which means City of Gold.,And not only is mobile the gold of today,,I don't believe that the gold is under the ground.,I believe we are the gold.,Like you've heard the other economists say,,we are at the point where China was,when its boom years began,,and that's where we're going. 
 So, you hear the West talknabout innovation at the edge.,Well, of course it's happening at the edge,,because in the middle,neverybody's updating Facebook,,or worse still, they're trying to understand,Facebook's privacy settings.,(Laughter),This is not that catchy catchphrase.,This is innovation over the edge. 
 So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,,but actually it's mobile-only,,so while everybody else is doing all of those things,,we're solving the world's problems.,So there's only one thing left to say. 
 ["You're welcome"] (Laughter) 
 (Applause)I have a question:,Who here remembers when they first realized,they were going to die? 
 I do. I was a young boy,,and my grandfather had just died,,and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night,trying to make sense of what had happened.,What did it mean that he was dead?,Where had he gone?,It was like a hole in reality had opened up,and swallowed him.,But then the really shockingnquestion occurred to me:,If he could die, could it happen to me too?,Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?,Would it open up beneath my bed,and swallow me as I slept?,Well, at some point, all childrennbecome aware of death.,It can happen in different ways, of course,,and usually comes in stages.,Our idea of death develops as we grow older.,And if you reach back into the dark corners,of your memory,,you might remember something like what I felt,when my grandfather died and when I realized,it could happen to me too,,that sense that behind all of this,the void is waiting. 
 And this development in childhood,reflects the development of our species.,Just as there was a point in your development,as a child when your sense of self and of time,became sophisticated enough,for you to realize you were mortal,,so at some point in the evolution of our species,,some early human's sense of self and of time,became sophisticated enough,for them to become the first human to realize,,"I'm going to die.",This is, if you like, our curse.,It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.,We have to live in the knowledge,that the worst thing that can possibly happen,one day surely will,,the end of all our projects,,our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.,We each live in the shadow of a personal,apocalypse. 
 And that's frightening. It's terrifying.,And so we look for a way out.,And in my case, as I was about five years old,,this meant asking my mum.,Now when I first started asking,what happens when we die,,the grown-ups around me at the time,answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness,and half-hearted Christianity,,and the phrase I heard most often,was that granddad was now,"up there looking down on us,",and if I should die too, whichnwouldn't happen of course,,then I too would go up there,,which made death sound a lot like,an existential elevator.,Now this didn't sound very plausible.,I used to watch a children'snnews program at the time,,and this was the era of space exploration.,There were always rockets going up into the sky,,up into space, going up there.,But none of the astronauts when they came back,ever mentioned having met my granddad,or any other dead people.,But I was scared,,and the idea of taking the existential elevator,to see my granddad,sounded a lot better than being swallowed,by the void while I slept.,And so I believed it anyway,,even though it didn't make much sense. 
 And this thought process that I went through,as a child, and have been through many times since,,including as a grown-up,,is a product of what psychologists call,a bias.,Now a bias is a way in which we systematically,get things wrong,,ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,,distort reality, or see what we want to see,,and the bias I'm talking about,works like this:,Confront someone with the fact,that they are going to die,and they will believe just about any story,that tells them it isn't true,and they can, instead, live forever,,even if it means taking the existential elevator.,Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.,It has been demonstrated in over 400,empirical studies.,Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.,They work like this.,You take two groups of people,who are similar in all relevant respects,,and you remind one group that they're going to die,but not the other, then you compare their behavior.,So you're observing how it biases behavior,when people become aware of their mortality.,And every time, you get the same result:,People who are made aware of their mortality,are more willing to believe stories,that tell them they can escape death,and live forever.,So here's an example: One recent study,took two groups of agnostics,,that is people who are undecided,in their religious beliefs.,Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.,The other group was asked to think about,being lonely.,They were then asked againnabout their religious beliefs.,Those who had been askednto think about being dead,were afterwards twice as likely to express faith,in God and Jesus.,Twice as likely.,Even though the before theynwere all equally agnostic.,But put the fear of death in them,,and they run to Jesus. 
 Now, this shows that reminding people of death,biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,,and it works not just for religion,,but for any kind of belief system,that promises immortality in some form,,whether it's becoming famous,or having children,or even nationalism,,which promises you can livenon as part of a greater whole.,This is a bias that has shaped,the course of human history. 
 Now, the theory behind this bias,in the over 400 studies,is called terror management theory,,and the idea is simple. It's just this.,We develop our worldviews,,that is, the stories we tell ourselves,about the world and our place in it,,in order to help us manage,the terror of death.,And these immortality stories,have thousands of different manifestations,,but I believe that behind the apparent diversity,there are actually just four basic forms,that these immortality stories can take.,And we can see them repeating themselves,throughout history, just with slight variations,to reflect the vocabulary of the day.,Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four,basic forms of immortality story,,and I want to try to give you some sense,of the way in which they're retold by each culture,or generation,using the vocabulary of their day. 
 Now, the first story is the simplest.,We want to avoid death,,and the dream of doing that in this body,in this world forever,is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,,and it might at first sound implausible,,but actually, almost every culture in human history,has had some myth or legend,of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth,or something that promises to keep us going,forever.,Ancient Egypt had such myths,,ancient Babylon, ancient India.,Throughout European history, we find themnin the work of the alchemists,,and of course we still believe this today,,only we tell this story using the vocabulary,of science.,So 100 years ago,,hormones had just been discovered,,and people hoped that hormone treatments,were going to cure aging and disease,,and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,,genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.,But the idea that science can cure death,is just one more chapter in the story,of the magical elixir,,a story that is as old as civilization.,But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir,and staying alive forever,is a risky strategy.,When we look back through history,at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,,the one thing they now have in common,is that they're all dead. 
 So we need a backup plan,nand exactly this kind of plan B,is what the second kind of immortality story offers,,and that's resurrection.,And it stays with the idea that I am this body,,I am this physical organism.,It accepts that I'm going to have to die,but says, despite that,,I can rise up and I can live again.,In other words, I can do what Jesus did.,Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],,and then he rose up and lived again.,And the idea that we can all benresurrected to live again,is orthodox believe, not just for Christians,but also Jews and Muslims.,But our desire to believe this story,is so deeply embedded,that we are reinventing it again,for the scientific age,,for example, with the idea of cryonics.,That's the idea that when you die,,you can have yourself frozen,,and then, at some point when technology,has advanced enough,,you can be thawed out and repaired and revived,and so resurrected.,And so some people believe an omnipotent god,will resurrect them to live again,,and other people believe an nomnipotent scientist will do it. 
 But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,,of climbing out of the grave,,it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.,They find the body too messy, too unreliable,to guarantee eternal life,,and so they set their hopes on the third,,more spiritual immortality story,,the idea that we can leave our body behind,and live on as a soul.,Now, the majority of people on Earth,believe they have a soul,,and the idea is central to many religions.,But even though, in its current form,,in its traditional form,,the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,,nonetheless we are again,reinventing it for the digital age,,for example with the idea,that you can leave your body behind,by uploading your mind, your essence,,the real you, onto a computer,,and so live on as an avatar in the ether. 
 But of course there are skeptics who say,if we look at the evidence of science,,particularly neuroscience,,it suggests that your mind,,your essence, the real you,,is very much dependent on a particular part,of your body, that is, your brain.,And such skeptics can find comfort,in the fourth kind of immortality story,,and that is legacy,,the idea that you can live on,through the echo you leave in the world,,like the great Greek warrior Achilles,,who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy,so that he might win immortal fame.,And the pursuit of fame is as widespread,and popular now as it ever was,,and in our digital age,,it's even easier to achieve.,You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles,or a great king or hero.,All you need is an Internet connectionnand a funny cat. (Laughter),But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,,biological legacy -- children, for example.,Or they like, they hope, to live on,as part of some greater whole,,a nation or a family or a tribe,,their gene pool.,But again, there are skeptics,who doubt whether legacy,really is immortality.,Woody Allen, for example, who said,,"I don't want to live on innthe hearts of my countrymen.,I want to live on in my apartment." 
 So those are the four,basic kinds of immortality stories,,and I've tried to give just some sense,of how they're retold by each generation,with just slight variations,to fit the fashions of the day.,And the fact that they recur in this way,,in such a similar form butnin such different belief systems,,suggests, I think,,that we should be skeptical of the truth,of any particular version of these stories.,The fact that some people believe,an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again,and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it,suggests that neither are really believing this,on the strength of the evidence.,Rather, we believe these stories,because we are biased to believe them,,and we are biased to believe them,because we are so afraid of death. 
 So the question is,,are we doomed to lead the one life we have,in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,,or can we overcome this bias?,Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus,thought we could.,He argued that the fear of death is natural,,but it is not rational.,"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,,because when we are here, death is not,,and when death is here, we are gone.",Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult,to really grasp, to really internalize,,because exactly this idea of being gone,is so difficult to imagine.,So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,,Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:,"Death is not an event in life:,We do not live to experience death.,And so," he added,,"in this sense, life has no end." 
 So it was natural for me as a child,to fear being swallowed by the void,,but it wasn't rational,,because being swallowed by the void,is not something that any of us,will ever live to experience. 
 Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because,the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,,yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,,and when we bring out into the open,the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,,then we can at least start,to try to minimize the influence it has,on our lives. 
 Now, I find it helps to see life,as being like a book:,Just as a book is bounded by its covers,,by beginning and end,,so our lives are bounded by birth and death,,and even though a book isnlimited by beginning and end,,it can encompass distant landscapes,,exotic figures, fantastic adventures.,And even though a book isnlimited by beginning and end,,the characters within it,know no horizons.,They only know the momentsnthat make up their story,,even when the book is closed.,And so the characters of a book,are not afraid of reaching the last page.,Long John Silver is not afraid of you,finishing your copy of "Treasure Island.",And so it should be with us.,Imagine the book of your life,,its covers, its beginning and end,nand your birth and your death.,You can only know the moments in between,,the moments that make up your life.,It makes no sense for you to fear,what is outside of those covers,,whether before your birth,or after your death.,And you needn't worry how long the book is,,or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.,The only thing that matters,is that you make it a good story. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So when I was eight years old,,a new girl came to join the class,,and she was so impressive,,as the new girl always seems to be.,She had vast quantities of very shiny hair,and a cute little pencil case,,super strong on state capitals,,just a great speller.,And I just curdled with jealousy that year,,until I hatched my devious plan.,So one day I stayed a little late after school,,a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.,When the coast was clear, I emerged,,crept into the classroom,,and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.,And then I did it.,I fiddled with my rival's grades,,just a little, just demoted some of those A's.,All of those A's. (Laughter),And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,,when hang on, some of my other classmates,had appallingly good grades too.,So, in a frenzy,,I corrected everybody's marks,,not imaginatively.,I gave everybody a row of D's,and I gave myself a row of A's,,just because I was there, you know, might as well. 
 And I am still baffled by my behavior.,I don't understand where the idea came from.,I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.,I felt great.,I don't understand why I was never caught.,I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.,I was never caught.,But most of all, I am baffled by,,why did it bother me so much,that this little girl, this tiny little girl,,was so good at spelling?,Jealousy baffles me.,It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.,We know babies suffer from jealousy.,We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.,We know that jealousy is the number one cause,of spousal murder in the United States.,And yet, I have never read a study,that can parse to me its loneliness,or its longevity or its grim thrill.,For that, we have to go to fiction,,because the novel is the lab,that has studied jealousy,in every possible configuration.,In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say,that if we didn't have jealousy,,would we even have literature?,Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey.",No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights.",No Shakespeare.,There goes high school reading lists,,because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,",we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,",we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K.",No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,,I know it's fashionable to say that Proust,has the answers to everything,,but in the case of jealousy,,he kind of does.,This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,",and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy,and just regular competitiveness, my brand,,that we can hope to have. (Laughter),And we think about Proust, we think,about the sentimental bits, right?,We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.,We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.,We forget how harsh his vision was.,We forget how pitiless he is.,I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said,were tough as cat gut.,I don't know what cat gut is,,but let's assume it's formidable. 
 Let's look at why they go so well together,,the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.,Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,,which boils down into person, desire, impediment,,is such a solid narrative foundation?,I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,,because let's think about what happens,when we feel jealous.,When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.,We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,,and these stories make us feel terrible,because they're designed to make us feel terrible.,As the teller of the tale and the audience,,we know just what details to include,,to dig that knife in. Right?,Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,,and this is something Proust understood. 
 In the first volume, Swann's Way,,the series of books,,Swann, one of the main characters,,is thinking very fondly of his mistress,and how great she is in bed,,and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,,and these are Proustian sentences,,so they're long as rivers,,but in the course of a few sentences,,he suddenly recoils and he realizes,,"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,,somebody else would love about this woman.,Everything that she does that gives me pleasure,could be giving somebody else pleasure,,maybe right about now.",And this is the story he starts to tell himself,,and from then on, Proust writes that,every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,,he adds to his "collection of instruments,in his private torture chamber." 
 Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,,were notoriously jealous.,You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave,the country if they wanted to break up with him.,But you don't have to be that jealous,to concede that it's hard work. Right?,Jealousy is exhausting.,It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. 
 And what does jealousy like?,Jealousy likes information.,Jealousy likes details.,Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,,the cute little pencil case.,Jealousy likes photos.,That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter),Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.,When Swann is in his jealous throes,,and suddenly he's listening at doorways,and bribing his mistress' servants,,he defends these behaviors.,He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,,but it is no different,from interpreting an ancient text,or looking at a monument.",He says, "They are scientific investigations,with real intellectual value.",Proust is trying to show us that jealousy,feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,,but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,,a quest for truth, painful truth,,and actually, where Proust is concerned,,the more painful the truth, the better.,Grief, humiliation, loss:,These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.,He says, "A woman whom we need,,who makes us suffer, elicits from us,a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital,than a man of genius who interests us.",Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?,No. I think he's trying to say,that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.,And does any other emotion crack us open,in this particular way?,Does any other emotion reveal to us,our aggression and our hideous ambition,and our entitlement?,Does any other emotion teach us to look,with such peculiar intensity? 
 Freud would write about this later.,One day, Freud was visited,by this very anxious young man who was consumed,with the thought of his wife cheating on him.,And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,,because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.,Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.,The poor creature is just,under suspicion for no cause.,But he's looking for things that his wife is doing,without noticing, unintentional behaviors.,Is she smiling too brightly here,,or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?,[Freud] says that the man is becoming,the custodian of his wife's unconscious. 
 The novel is very good on this point.,The novel is very good at describing how jealousy,trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.,In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,,the more we become residents of fantasy.,And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't,just provoke us to do violent things,or illegal things.,Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways,that are wildly inventive.,Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,,but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.,A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught,creating a fake Facebook account,from which she sent vile, hideous messages,to herself for a year.,For a year. A year.,And she was trying to frame,her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,,and I have to confess when I heard this,,I just reacted with admiration.,(Laughter),Because, I mean, let's be real.,What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?,This is something from a novel.,This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. 
 Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.,She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.,She's the author of "Strangers on a Train",and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,",books that are all about how jealousy,,it muddles our minds,,and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,,the membrane between what is and what could be,can be pierced in an instant.,Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.,Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you,or wanting what you have,to being you and having what you once had,,and you're under the floorboards,,he's answering to your name,,he's wearing your rings,,emptying your bank account.,That's one way to go. 
 But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.,I can't give the world D's,,as much as I would really like to, some days.,And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.,We live in jealous times.,I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,,aren't we, where the currency is envy? 
 Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.,So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,,when they are in possession of a mystery.,Let's go to 221B Baker Street,and ask for Sherlock Holmes.,When people think of Holmes,,they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,,right, this criminal mastermind.,But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,,who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard,who needs Holmes desperately,,needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.,Oh, it's so familiar to me.,So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,,and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.,But as they work together, something starts to change,,and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,",once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,,Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,,"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.,We're proud of you.",And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard,who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. 
 It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved,in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,,this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?,It seems to treat jealousy,as a problem of geometry, not emotion.,You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.,The next minute they're on the same side.,Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself,admire this mind that he's resented.,Could it be so simple though?,What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,,just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand,in relation to another?,Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent,somebody's excellence.,We could align ourselves with it. 
 But I like contingency plans.,So while we wait for that to happen,,let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.,Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.,Fiction alone domesticates it,,invites it to the table.,And look who it gathers:,sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,,crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.,We are in excellent company.,Thank you.,(Applause)Hi. So today, I'd like to sharensome works in progress.,Since we are still realizing these works,,we are largely working within the realm,of intuition and mystery, still.,So I'm going to try and describe,some of the experiences that we're looking for,through each of the works. 
 So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.,A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,,and catches a glimpse of these panels,in a messy composition on the wall.,Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed,the presence of the viewer,,they appear to panic and sort of get into,a strict symmetry.,(Laughter),So this is the sketch of the two states.,One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.,And we were interested in seeing how little change,it takes to move from one state to the other state.,This also reminded us of twonvery different pictorial traditions.,One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,,and the other is about 100 years ago,,Malevich's abstract compositions.,So I'm just going to take you to a video.,To give you a sense of scale,,the largest panel is about two meters high.,That's about this much. nAnd the smallest one is an A4.,So a viewer enters the space,,and they snap to attention.,And after a while, if the viewer continues,to remain in the space,,the panels will sort of become immune,to the presence of the viewer,and become lax and autonomous again,,until they sort of sense a presencenin the room or a movement,,when they will again snap to attention.,(Laughter),So here it appears as if it's the viewer,that's sort of instigating the sensenof order among the panels,,but it could also be the other way around,,that the panels are so stuck within,their preconditioned behaviors,that they sort of thrust thenviewer with the role of a tyrant. 
 So this brings me to a quieter, small work,called Handheld.,The viewer sees a piece of paper,that's mounted on the far end of the wall,,but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank,A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,,that's held on either side,by two small hands,that appear to be carved with a great deal,of attention and care from a small block of wood.,The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture,is sort of moving very slightly,,as if these two hands are trying,to hold the paper very still,for a long period of time,,and somehow are not managing to.,So this instability in the movement,very closely resembles the unsteady nature,of images seen through a handheld camera.,So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.,One is through a still camera,and the other is through a handheld camera.,And you immediately see how the unsteady nature,of the video suggests the presence,of an observer and a subjective point of view.,So we've just removed the camera,and transferred that movement onto the panel.,So here's a video.,You have to imagine the other hand.nIt's not there yet.,But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke,a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person,with outstretched arms,behind this enormous piece of paper.,That sort of likens it to the amount of strain,to be at the service of the observer and present,this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer,in front of them. 
 The next work is Decoy.,This is a cardboard model, so the object,is about as tall as I am.,It has a rounded body, two arms,,and a very tall, head-like antenna,,and its sole purpose is tonattract attention towards itself.,So when a viewer passes by,,it sort of tilts from side to side,,and moves its arms more and more frantically,as the person gets closer.,So here is the first test scenario.,You see the two movements integrated,,and the object seems to be employing,its entire being in this expression of desperation.,But the idea is that once it'sngot the person's attention,,it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.,(Laughter),So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.,It appears to be mass-manufactured,like it came out of a factory,like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.,Because we are always working,from a very personal space,,we like how this consumer aesthetic,sort of depersonalizes the object,and gives us a bit of distance,in its appearance, at least.,And so to us this is a kind of sinister being,which is trying to distract you from the things,that actually need your attention,,but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.,The next work is an object,,that's also a kind of sound instrument.,In the shape of an amphitheater,that's scaled to the size of an audience,as perceived from somebody from the stage.,So from where I'm standing,,each of you appears to be this big,,and the audience sort of takes the entire,field of my vision.,Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.,They're mechanically enabled to clap,of their own free will.,This means that each of them can decide,if and when they want to clap,,how hard, for how long,,how they want to be influenced bynthose around them or influence others,,and if they want to contribute to innovation.,So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,,there will be a response.,It could be a few claps or a strong applause,,and then nothing happens until the viewer,leaves the stage, and againnthe audience will respond.,It could be anything from a few feeble claps,from members in the audience,,or it could be a very loud ovation.,So to us, I think we're really looking,at an audience as its own object,or its own organism,that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,,an instrument.,So the viewer can play it,by eliciting quite complex and varied,,nuanced musical or sound patterns,,but cannot really provoke the audience,into any particular kind of response.,So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness,and uneasiness involved.,It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.,So here if you see we're quite excited about,the image of the head splittingnto form the two hands.,So here's a small visual animation,,as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing,against each other to kind of make sense,of the duality and the tension.,And here is a prototype.,So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them. 
 Okay, this is the last work.nIt's called the Framerunners.,It comes out of the idea of a window.,This is an actual window in our studio,,and as you can see, it's made up of three,different thicknesses of wooden sections.,So we used the same window vocabulary,to construct our own frame or grid,that's suspended in the room and that can,be viewed from two sides.,This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.,They're also made up of three different sizes,,as if to suggest a kind of perspective,or landscape on the single plain.,Each of these figures can also run backward,and forward in the track,and hide behind two adjacent tracks.,So in contrast to this very tight grid,,we wanted to give these figures a very comical,and slapstick-like quality,,as if a puppeteer has taken them,and physically animated them down the path.,So we like the idea of these figures,sort of skipping along,like they're oblivious and carefree,and happy-go-lucky and content,,until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer,and they will hide behind the fastest wall.,So to us, this work also presentsnits own contradiction.,These figures are sort of entrapped,within this very strong grid,,which is like a prison, but also a fortress,,because it allows them to be oblivious,and naive and carefree and quite oblivious,of the external world.,So all these real life qualities that I talk about,are sort of translated to a very specific,technical configuration,,and we were very lucky to collaborate,with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.,So you see they extracted the motion cogs,from our animations and created a wiggle,that integrated the head-bobbing movement,and the back-and-forth movement.,So it's really quite small.,You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.,So imagine our excitement when we saw it,really working in the studio, and here it is. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The 2011 Arab Spring,captured the attention of the world.,It also captured the attention,of authoritarian governments in other countries,,who were worried that revolution would spread.,To respond, they ramped up surveillance,of activists, journalists and dissidents,who they feared would inspire revolution,in their own countries.,One prominent Bahraini activist,,who was arrested and tortured by his government,,has said that the interrogators showed him,transcripts of his telephone calls,and text messages. 
 Of course, it's no secret,that governments are able to interceptntelephone calls and text messages.,It's for that reason that many activists,specifically avoid using the telephone.,Instead, they use tools like Skype,,which they think are immune to interception.,They're wrong.,There have now been over the last few years,an industry of companies,who provide surveillance technology to governments,,specifically technology thatnallows those governments,to hack into the computers,of surveillance targets.,Rather than intercepting the communications nas they go over the wire,,instead they now hack into your computer,,enable your webcam, enable your microphone,,and steal documents from your computer. 
 When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,,activists raided the office of the secret police,,and among the many documents they found,was this document by the Gamma Corporation,,by Gamma International.,Gamma is a German company,that manufactures surveillance software,and sells it only to governments.,It's important to note that most governments,don't really have the in-house capabilities,to develop this software.,Smaller ones don't have the resources,or the expertise,,and so there's this market of Western companies,who are happy to supply them with the tools,and techniques for a price.,Gamma is just one of these companies.,I should note also that Gamma never actually sold,their software to the Egyptian government.,They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,,but the Egyptians never bought it.,Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government,used a free demo version of Gamma's software.,(Laughter) 
 So this screenshot is from a sales video,that Gamma produced.,Really, they're just emphasizing,in a relatively slick presentation,the fact that the police can sort of sit,in an air-conditioned office,and remotely monitor someone,without them having any idea that it's going on.,You know, your webcam light won't turn on.,There's nothing to indicate thatnthe microphone is enabled. 
 This is the managing directornof Gamma International.,His name is Martin Muench.,There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.,This is perhaps my favorite.,I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.,You can see there's a little sticker,that's placed over his camera.,He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,,and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used,against him.,Muench has said that he intends,for his software to be used,to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.,Of course, he's also acknowledged that once,the software has been sold to governments,,he has no way of knowing how it can be used.,Gamma's software has been located on servers,in countries around the world,,many with really atrocious track records,and human rights violations.,They really are selling theirnsoftware around the world. 
 Gamma is not the only company in the business.,As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.,One of the other big guys in the industry,is an Italian company called Hacking Team.,Now, Hacking Team has what is probably,the slickest presentation.,The video they've produced is very sexy,,and so I'm going to play you a clip,just so you can get a feel,both for the capabilities of the software,but also how it's marketed,to their government clients. 
 (Video) Narrator: You want to look nthrough your target's eyes.,(Music),You have to hack your target.,["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"],You have to hit many different platforms.,["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android,nBlackberry, Symbian, Linux"],You have to overcome encryption,and capture relevant data.,[Skype & encrypted calls, target location, nmessaging, relationships,,web browsing, audio & video"],Being stealth and untraceable.,["Immune to any protection systemnHidden collection infrastructure"],Deployed all over your country.,["Up to hundreds of thousands of targetsnManaged from a single spot"],Exactly what we do. 
 Christopher Soghoian: So, itnwould be funny if it wasn't true,,but, in fact, Hacking Team's software,is being sold to governments around the world.,Last year we learned, for example,,that it's been used to target Moroccan njournalists by the Moroccan government.,Many, many countries it's been found in.,So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting,the U.S. law enforcement market.,In the last year or so, the company,has opened a sales office in Maryland.,The company has also hired a spokesperson.,They've been attending,surveillance industry conferences,where law enforcement officials show up.,They've spoken at the conferences.,What I thought was most fascinating was,they've actually paid for the coffee break,at one of the law enforcement conferences,earlier this year.,I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team,has sold their technology in the United States,,but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,,it isn't because they haven't been trying hard. 
 So as I said before,,governments that don't really have the resources,to build their own tools will buy,off-the-shelf surveillance software,,and so for that reason,,you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,,might use the same softwarenas the government of Germany.,They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.,The Federal Bureau ofnInvestigation in the United States,does have the budget to buildntheir own surveillance technology,,and so for several years, I've been trying,to figure out if and how the FBI,is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets. 
 My friends at an organization callednthe Electronic Frontier Foundation --,they're a civil society group —,obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI,detailing their next generationnof surveillance technologies.,Most of these documents were heavily redacted,,but what you can see from the slides,,if I zoom in, is this term:,Remote Operations Unit.,Now, when I first looked into this,,I'd never heard of this unit before.,I've been studying surveillancenfor more than six years.,I'd never heard of it.,And so I went online and I did some research,,and ultimately I hit the mother lode,when I went to LinkedIn,,the social networking site for job seekers.,There were lots of formernU.S. government contractors,who had at one point worked,for the Remote Operating Unit,,and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs,what they had done in their former job.,(Laughter),So I took this information,and I gave it to a journalist that I knownand trust at the Wall Street Journal,,and she was able to contact several other,former law enforcement officials,who spoke on background and confirmed,that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team,that does nothing but hack into the computers,of surveillance targets.,Like Gamma and Hacking Team,,the FBI also has the capability,to remotely activate webcams, microphones,,steal documents, get web browsing information,,the works. 
 There's sort of a big problem,with governments going into hacking,,and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,,drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists,all use the same kinds of computers.,There's no drug dealer phone,and there's no journalist laptop.,We all use the same technology,,and what that means then is that for governments,to have the capability to hack into the computers,of the real bad guys,,they also have to have the capability,to hack into our devices too. 
 So governments around the world,have been embracing this technology.,They've been embracing hacking,as a law enforcement technique,,but without any real debate.,In the United States, where I live,,there have been no congressional hearings.,There's no law that's been passed,specifically authorizing this technique,,and because of its power and potential for abuse,,it's vital that we have an informed public debate. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I am an engineering professor,,and for the past 14 years,I've been teaching crap.,(Laughter),Not that I'm a bad teacher,,but I've been studying and teaching,about human waste,and how waste is conveyed,through these wastewater treatment plants,,and how we engineer and design,these treatment plants so that we can protect,surface water like rivers. 
 I've based my scientific career,on using leading-edge molecular techniques,,DNA- and RNA-based methods,to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,,and again to optimize these systems.,And over the years,,I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,,and I've been known to sneak into toilets,and take my camera phone,all over the world. 
 But along the way, I've learned,that it's not just the technical side,,but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.,So for example,,how many of you are washers,and how many of you are wipers?,(Laughter),If, well, I guess you know what I mean.,If you're a washer, then you use water,for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.,And if you're a wiper,,then you use toilet paper,or, in some regions of the world,where it's not available, newspaper,or rags or corncobs. 
 And this is not just a piece of trivia,,but it's really important to understand,and solve the sanitation problem.,And it is a big problem:,There are 2.5 billion people in the world,who don't have access to adequate sanitation.,For them, there's no modern toilet.,And there are 1.1 billion people,whose toilets are the streets,or river banks or open spaces,,and again, the technical term for that is,open defecation,,but that is really simply,shitting in the open.,And if you're living in fecal material,and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.,It's going to get into your drinking water,,into your food, into your immediate surroundings.,So the United Nations estimates,that every year, there are n1.5 million child deaths,because of inadequate sanitation.,That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,,171 every hour,,4,100 every day.,And so, to avoid open defecation,,municipalities and cities,build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,,in peri-urban and rural areas.,For example, in KwaZulu-Natal nprovince in South Africa,,they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.,But there's a problem when you scale up,to tens of thousands, and the problem is,,what happens when the pits are full?,This is what happens.,People defecate around the toilet.,In schools, children defecate on the floors,and then leave a trail outside the building,and start defecating around the building,,and these pits have to be cleaned,and manually emptied.,And who does the emptying?,You've got these workers,who have to sometimes go down into the pits,and manually remove the contents.,It's a dirty and dangerous business.,As you can see, there's no protective equipment,,no protective clothing.,There's one worker down there.,I hope you can see him.,He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.,And in some countries, like India,,the lower castes are condemned,to empty the pits,,and they're further condemned by society. 
 So you ask yourself, how can we solve this,and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets,for these two and a half billion?,And the answer is, it's just not possible.,In some of these areas, there's not enough water,,there's no energy,,it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars,to lay out the sewer lines,and to build the facilities,and to operate and maintain these systems,,and if you don't build it right,,you're going to have flush toilets,that basically go straight into the river,,just like what's happening in many cities,in the developing world.,And is this really the solution?,Because essentially, what you're doing is,you're using clean water,and you're using it to flush your toilet,,convey it to a wastewater treatment plant,which then discharges to a river,,and that river, again, is a drinking water source. 
 So we've got to rethink sanitation,,and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,,and I'm going to argue that to do this,,you have to employ systems thinking.,We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.,We start with a human interface,,and then we have to think about how feces,are collected and stored,,transported, treated and reused —,and not just disposal but reuse. 
 So let's start with the human user interface.,I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,,a sitter or a squatter,,the human user interface should be clean,and easy to use, because after all,,taking a dump should be pleasurable.,(Laughter),And when we open the possibilities,to understanding this sanitation chain,,then the back-end technology,,the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,,and then we can apply,locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.,So we can open ourselves to possibilities like,,for example, this urine-diverting toilet,,and there's two holes in this toilet.,There's the front and the back,,and the front collects the urine,,and the back collects the fecal material.,And so what you're doing isnyou're separating the urine,,which has 80 percent of the nitrogen,and 50 percent of the phosphorus,,and then that can then be treated,and precipitated to form things like struvite,,which is a high-value fertilizer,,and then the fecal material can then be disinfected,and again converted to high-value end products.,Or, for example, in some of our research,,you can reuse the water by treating it,in on-site sanitation systems,like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.,So we can open up all these possibilities,if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets,and treatment plants. 
 So you might be asking, who's going to pay?,Well, I'm going to argue that governments,should fund sanitation infrastructure.,NGOs and donor organizations,,they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.,Governments should fund sanitation,the same way they fund roads,and schools and hospitals,and other infrastructure like bridges,,because we know, and the WHO has done this study,,that for every dollar that we invest,in sanitation infrastructure,,we get something like three to 34 dollars back. 
 Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.,So at North Carolina State University,,we challenged our students toncome up with a simple solution,,and this is what they came up with:,a simple, modified screw auger,that can move the waste up,from the pit and into a collecting drum,,and now the pit worker,doesn't have to go down into the pit.,We tested it in South Africa, and it works.,We need to make it more robust,,and we're going to do more testing,in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.,And our idea is to make this,a professionalized pit-emptying service,so that we can create a small business out of it,,create profits and jobs,,and the hope is that,,as we are rethinking sanitation,,we are extending the life of these pits,so that we don't have to resort,to quick solutions,that don't really make sense. 
 I believe that access to adequate sanitation,is a basic human right.,We need to stop the practice,of lower castes and lower-status people,going down and being condemned to empty pits.,It is our moral, it is our social,and our environmental obligation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a vending machine in Los Angeles.,It's in a shopping mall,nand it sells fish eggs.,It's a caviar-vending machine. 
 This is the Art-o-mat,nan art-vending machine,that sells small artistic creationsnby different artists,,usually on small wood blocksnor matchboxes, in limited edition. 
 This is Oliver Medvedik.,He is not a vending machine,nbut he is one of the founders of Genspace,,a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,,where anybody can go and take classes,and learn how to do thingsnlike grow E. coli that glows in the dark,or learn how to take strawberry DNA.,In fact, I saw Oliver donone of these strawberry DNA extractions,about a year ago, and this is what led meninto this bizarre path,that I'm going to talk to you right now.,Strawberry DNA is really fascinating,nbecause it's so beautiful.,I'd never thought about DNAnbeing a beautiful thing before,,before I saw it in this form.,A lot of people, especiallynin the art community,,don't necessarily engagenin science in this way.,I instantly joined Genspace after this,,and asked Oliver, "If we can donthis with strawberries,,can we do this with people?",About 10 minutes later,nwe were both spitting in vials,,coming up with a protocolnfor human DNA extraction.,I started doing this on my own.,This is what my DNA actually looks like. 
 And I was at a dinner partynwith some artist friends,,and I was telling them about this project,,and they couldn't believenthat you could actually see DNA.,So I said, all right, let's get outnsome supplies right now.,And I started having these bizarrendinner parties on Friday nights,,where people would come overnand we'd do DNA extractions,,and I would capture them on video,,because it creatednthis kind of funny portrait as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 These are people who don't necessarilynregularly engage with science.,You can kind of tell from their reactions. 
 (Laughter) 
 But they became fascinated by it,,and it was really exciting for mento see them get excited about science. 
 And so I started doing this regularly. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's an odd thing to donwith your Friday nights,,but this is what I started doing.,I started collecting a whole groupnof my friends' DNA in small vials,and categorizing them.,This is what that looked like.,And it started to make me thinknabout a couple of things.,First, this looked a lotnlike my Facebook wall.,So in a way, I creatednsort of a genetic social network. 
 And the second thing was,,one time a friend came overnand looked at this on my table,and was like, n"Uh ... why are they numbered?,Is this person more rarenthan the other one?",And I hadn't even thought about that.,They were just numbered,because that was the ordernthat I extracted the DNA in.,But that made me thinknabout collecting toys,,and what's going on right nownin the toy world with blind box toys,,and being able to collect these rare toys.,You buy these boxes, but aren't surenwhat's going to be inside.,But when you open them,nyou have different rarities of the toys.,I thought that was interesting;nI thought about this,and the caviar vending machinenand the Art-o-mat all together.,And for some reason, I was one nightndrawing a vending machine,,thinking of doing paintingsnof a vending machine.,The vial of my DNA was sitting there,,and I saw a beautiful collaborationnbetween the strands of DNA,and the coils of a vending machine.,So I decided to create an art installationncalled the DNA Vending Machine.,Here it is. 
 (Music) 
 [DNA Vending Machinenis an art installation,about our increasing accessnto biotechnology.] 
 (Music) 
 [For a reasonable cost,nyou can purchase a sample of human DNA,from a traditional vending machine.] 
 (Music) 
 [Each sample comes packaged,with a collectible limited editionnportrait of the human specimen.] 
 (Music) 
 [DNA Vending Machine treats DNAnas a collectible material,and brings to light legal issuesnover the ownership of DNA.] 
 (Music ends) 
 Gabriel Barcia-Colombo:,The DNA Vending Machine is currentlynin a couple of galleries in New York,,and it's selling out pretty well.,We're in the first edition of 100 pieces,,hoping to do another edition pretty soon.,I'd like to get itninto more of a metro hub,,like Grand Central or Penn Station,,next to some of the othernvending machines in that location. 
 But really, with thisnand a lot of my art projects,,I want to ask the audience a question:,When biotechnology and DNA sequencingnbecomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting,or 3D printing or buying caviarnfrom a vending machine,,will you submit your sample of DNAnto be part of the vending machine?,How much will these samples be worth?,Will you buy someone else's sample?,And what will you be able to donwith that sample? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A computer is an incredibly powerful means,of creative expression,,but for the most part,,that expression is confined to the screens,of our laptops and mobile phones.,And I'd like to tell you a story about,bringing this power of the computer,to move things around and interact with us,off of the screen and into the physical world,in which we live. 
 A few years ago, I got a call from,a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,,and the next thing I knew,,I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures,for their window displays. 
 This one's called "The Chase.",There are two pairs of shoes,,a man's pair and a woman's pair,,and they play out this slow, tense chase,around the window,in which the man scoots up behind the woman,and gets in her personal space,,and then she moves away.,Each of the shoes has magnets in it,,and there are magnets underneath the table,that move the shoes around. 
 My friend Andy Cavatorta was building,a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour,and I wound up building the electronics,and motion control software,to make the harps move and play music.,The harp has four separate pendulums,,and each pendulum has 11 strings,,so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates,in order to play different musical notes,,and the harps are all networked together,so that they can play the right notes,at the right time in the music. 
 I built an interactive chemistry exhibit,at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,,and this exhibit lets people use physical objects,to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table,and bring them together to cause,chemical reactions to happen.,And the museum noticed that people,were spending a lot of time with this exhibit,,and a researcher from a science education center,in Australia decided to study this exhibit,and try to figure out what was going on.,And she found that the physical objects,that people were using were helping people,understand how to use the exhibit,,and were helping people learn in a social way. 
 And when you think aboutnit, this makes a lot of sense,,that using specialized physical objects,would help people use an interface more easily.,I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized,to think about and interact with tangible objects.,Think about which you find easier to use,,a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard,like on a phone? 
 But the thing that struck me,about all of these different projects,is that they really had to be built from scratch,,down to the level of the electronics,and the printed circuit boards and,all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.,I wanted to create something,where we could move objectsnunder computer control,and create interactions around that idea,without having to go through this process,of building something from scratch,every single time. 
 So my first attempt at this,was at the MIT Media Lab,with Professor Hiroshi Ishii,,and we built this array of,512 different electromagnets,,and together they were able to move objects around,on top of their surface.,But the problem with this,was that these magnets,cost over 10,000 dollars.,Although each one was pretty small,,altogether they weighed so much,that the table that they were on,started to sag.,So I wanted to build something,where you could have this kind of interaction,on any tabletop surface. 
 So to explore this idea,,I built an army of small robots,,and each of these robots hasnwhat are called omni wheels.,They're these special wheels,that can move equally easily in all directions,,and when you couple these robots,with a video projector,,you have these physical tools,for interacting with digital information.,So here's an example of what I mean.,This is a video editing application,where all of the controls,for manipulating the video are physical.,So if we want to tweak the color,,we just enter the color mode,,and then we get three different dials,for tweaking the color,,or if we want to adjust the audio,,then we get two different dialsnfor that, these physical objects.,So here the left and right channel stay in sync,,but if we want to, we can override that,by grabbing both of them at the same time.,So the idea is that we get the speed,and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials,together with the flexibility and versatility,of a system that's designed in software. 
 And this is a mapping application,for disaster response.,So you have these physical objects,that represent police, fire and rescue,,and a dispatcher can grab them,and place them on the map,to tell those units where to go,,and then the position of the units on the map,gets synced up with the position,of those units in the real world. 
 This is a video chat application.,It's amazing how much emotion you can convey,with just a few simple movements,of a physical object. 
 With this interface, we open upna huge array of possibilities,in between traditional board games,and arcade games,,where the physical possibilities of interaction,make so many different styles of play possible. 
 But one of the areas that I'm most excited,about using this platform for,is applying it to problems that are difficult,for computers or people to solve alone.,One example of those is protein folding.,So here we have an interface,where we have physical handles onto a protein,,and we can grab those handles,and try to move the protein andntry to fold it in different ways.,And if we move it in a way thatndoesn't really make sense,with the underlying molecular simulation,,we get this physical feedback where we can,actually feel these physical handles,pulling back against us.,So feeling what's going on,inside a molecular simulation,is a whole different level of interaction. 
 So we're just beginning to explore,what's possible when we use software,to control the movement,of objects in our environment.,Maybe this is the computer of the future.,There's no touchscreen.,There's no technology visible at all.,But when we want to have a video chat,or play a game,or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,,the objects on the table come alive. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a palliative care physician,and I would like to talk to yountoday about health care.,I'd like to talk to younabout the health and care,of the most vulnerablenpopulation in our country --,those people dealing with the mostncomplex serious health issues.,I'd like to talk to younabout economics as well.,And the intersection of these twonshould scare the hell out of you --,it scares the hell out of me. 
 I'd also like to talk to younabout palliative medicine:,a paradigm of care for this population,ngrounded in what they value.,Patient-centric care based on their values,that helps this populationnlive better and longer.,It's a care model that tells the truth,and engages one-on-one,and meets people where they're at. 
 I'd like to start by telling the storynof my very first patient.,It was my first day as a physician,,with the long white coat ...,I stumbled into the hospital,and right away there's a gentleman,nHarold, 68 years old,,came to the emergency department.,He had had headaches for about six weeks,that got worse and worsenand worse and worse.,Evaluation revealed he had cancernthat had spread to his brain.,The attending physician directed mento go share with Harold and his family,the diagnosis, the prognosisnand options of care. 
 Five hours into my new career,,I did the only thing I knew how.,I walked in,,sat down,,took Harold's hand,,took his wife's hand,and just breathed. 
 He said, "It's not goodnnews is it, sonny?" 
 I said, "No." 
 And so we talkednand we listened and we shared.,And after a while I said,,"Harold, what is itnthat has meaning to you?,What is it that you hold sacred?" 
 And he said,,"My family." 
 I said, "What do you want to do?" 
 He slapped me on the kneenand said, "I want to go fishing." 
 I said, "That, I know how to do." 
 Harold went fishing the next day.,He died a week later. 
 As I've gone throughnmy training in my career,,I think back to Harold.,And I think that this is a conversation,that happens far too infrequently.,And it's a conversationnthat had led us to crisis,,to the biggest threatnto the American way of life today,,which is health care expenditures. 
 So what do we know?,We know thatnthis population, the most ill,,takes up 15 percentnof the gross domestic product --,nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.,So the sickest 15 percentntake up 15 percent of the GDP.,If we extrapolate this outnover the next two decades,with the growth of baby boomers,,at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.,Sixty percent of the grossndomestic product,of the United States of America --,it has very little to donwith health care at that point.,It has to do with a gallon of milk,,with college tuition.,It has to do withnevery thing that we value,and every thing that we know presently.,It has at stake the free-marketneconomy and capitalism,of the United States of America. 
 Let's forget all the statisticsnfor a minute, forget the numbers.,Let's talk about the value we getnfor all these dollars we spend.,Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,nabout six years ago,,looked at every dollarnspent by Medicare --,generally this population.,We found that those patients who haventhe highest per capita expenditures,had the highest suffering,npain, depression.,And, more often than not, they die sooner. 
 How can this be?,We live in the United States,,it has the greatest health carensystem on the planet.,We spend 10 times more on these patients,than the second-leadingncountry in the world.,That doesn't make sense.,But what we know is,,out of the top 50 countries on the planet,with organized health care systems,,we rank 37th.,Former Eastern Bloc countriesnand sub-Saharan African countries,rank higher than usnas far as quality and value. 
 Something I experiencenevery day in my practice,,and I'm sure, something many of younon your own journeys have experienced:,more is not more.,Those individuals who had more tests,,more bells, more whistles,,more chemotherapy,nmore surgery, more whatever --,the more that we do to someone,,it decreases the quality of their life.,And it shortens it, most often. 
 So what are we going to do about this?,What are we doing about this?,And why is this so?,The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,,is that we, the health care industry --nlong white-coat physicians --,are stealing from you.,Stealing from you the opportunity,to choose how you want to live your lives,in the context of whatever disease it is.,We focus on diseasenand pathology and surgery,and pharmacology.,We miss the human being.,How can we treat this,without understanding this?,We do things to this;,we need to do things for this. 
 The triple aim of healthcare:,one, improve patient experience.,Two, improve the population health.,Three, decrease per capita expenditurenacross a continuum.,Our group, palliative care,,in 2012, working withnthe sickest of the sick --,cancer,,heart disease, lung disease,,renal disease,,dementia --,how did we improve patient experience? 
 "I want to be at home, Doc." 
 "OK, we'll bring the care to you." 
 Quality of life, enhanced.,Think about the human being. 
 Two: population health.,How did we looknat this population differently,,and engage with themnat a different level, a deeper level,,and connect to a broader sensenof the human condition than my own?,How do we manage this group,,so that of our outpatient population,,94 percent, in 2012,nnever had to go to the hospital?,Not because they couldn't.,But they didn't have to.,We brought the care to them.,We maintained their value, their quality. 
 Number three: per capita expenditures.,For this population,,that today is 2.3 trillion dollarsnand in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,,we reduced health care expendituresnby nearly 70 percent.,They got more of what they wantednbased on their values,,lived better and are living longer,,for two-thirds less money. 
 While Harold's time was limited,,palliative care's is not.,Palliative care is a paradigmnfrom diagnosis through the end of life.,The hours,,weeks, months, years,,across a continuum --,with treatment, without treatment. 
 Meet Christine.,Stage III cervical cancer,,so, metastatic cancernthat started in her cervix,,spread throughout her body.,She's in her 50s and she is living.,This is not about end of life,,this is about life.,This is not just about the elderly,,this is about people. 
 This is Richard.,End-stage lung disease. 
 "Richard, what is itnthat you hold sacred?" 
 "My kids, my wife and my Harley." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Alright!,I can't drive you around on itnbecause I can barely pedal a bicycle,,but let's see what we can do." 
 Richard came to me,,and he was in rough shape.,He had this little voice telling him,that maybe his time was weeks to months.,And then we just talked.,And I listened and tried to hear --,big difference.,Use these in proportion to this. 
 I said, "Alright, let's take itnone day at a time,",like we do in everynother chapter of our life.,And we have met Richardnwhere Richard's at day-to-day.,And it's a phone call or two a week,,but he's thriving in the contextnof end-stage lung disease. 
 Now, palliative medicine is notnjust for the elderly,,it is not just for the middle-aged.,It is for everyone. 
 Meet my friend Jonathan.,We have the honor and pleasure,of Jonathan and his fathernjoining us here today.,Jonathan is in his 20s,nand I met him several years ago.,He was dealing withnmetastatic testicular cancer,,spread to his brain.,He had a stroke,,he had brain surgery,,radiation, chemotherapy.,Upon meeting him and his family,,he was a couple of weeks awaynfrom a bone marrow transplant,,and in listening and engaging,,they said, "Help usnunderstand -- what is cancer?" 
 How did we get this far,without understandingnwhat we're dealing with?,How did we get this farnwithout empowering somebody,to know what it is they're dealing with,,and then taking the next step and engagingnin who they are as human beings,to know if that is what we should do?,Lord knows we can donany kind of thing to you.,But should we? 
 And don't take my word for it.,All the evidence that is relatednto palliative care these days,demonstrates with absolute certaintynpeople live better and live longer.,There was a seminal articlenout of the New England Journal of Medicine,in 2010.,A study done at Harvardnby friends of mine, colleagues.,End-stage lung cancer:,one group with palliative care,,a similar group without.,The group with palliative carenreported less pain,,less depression.,They needed fewer hospitalizations.,And, ladies and gentlemen,,they lived three to six months longer.,If palliative care were a cancer drug,,every cancer doctor on the planetnwould write a prescription for it.,Why don't they?,Again, because we goofy,nlong white-coat physicians,are trained and of the mantranof dealing with this,,not with this. 
 This is a space that we willnall come to at some point.,But this conversation todaynis not about dying,,it is about living.,Living based on our values,,what we find sacred,and how we want to writenthe chapters of our lives,,whether it's the last,or the last five.,What we know,,what we have proven,,is that this conversationnneeds to happen today --,not next week, not next year.,What is at stake is our lives today,and the lives of us as we get older,and the lives of our childrennand our grandchildren.,Not just in that hospital room,or on the couch at home,,but everywhere we gonand everything we see.,Palliative medicine is the answernto engage with human beings,,to change the journeynthat we will all face,,and change it for the better. 
 To my colleagues,,to my patients,,to my government,,to all human beings,,I ask that we stand and wenshout and we demand,the best care possible,,so that we can live better today,and ensure a better life tomorrow.,We need to shift today,so that we can live tomorrow. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,,and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,,because the average bank robbery nets,only 7,500 dollars.,Rank amateurs who know nothing,about how to cook the books. 
 The folks who know, of course,,run our largest banks,,and in the last go-around,,they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.,That's what 11 trillion looks like.,That's how many zeros?,And cost us over 10 million jobs as well. 
 So our task is to educate ourselves,so that we can understand,why we have these recurrent,,intensifying financial crises,,and how we can prevent them in the future.,And the answer to that is,that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.,Control fraud is what happens,when the people who control,,typically a CEO,,a seemingly legitimate entity,,use it as a weapon to defraud.,And these are the weapons of mass destruction,in the financial world. 
 They also follow in finance a particular strategy,,because the weapon of choice in finance,is accounting,,and there is a recipe for accounting,control fraud, and how it occurs.,And we discovered this recipe,in quite an odd way that I'llncome back to in a moment.,First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;,second, by making or buying really crappy loans,,but loans that are made at a very high interest rate,or yield;,three, while employing extreme leverage --,that just means a lot of debt --,compared to your equity;,and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves,against the inevitable losses.,If you follow those four simple steps,,and any bank can follow them,,then you are mathematically guaranteed,to have three things occur.,The first thing is,you will report record bank profits --,not just high, record.,Two, the CEO will immediatelynbe made incredibly wealthy,by modern executive compensation.,And three, farther down the road,,the bank will suffer catastrophic losses,and will fail unless it is bailed out.,And that's a hint as to how,we discovered this recipe,,because we discovered itnthrough an autopsy process.,During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,,we looked at every single failure,,and we looked for common characteristics,,and we discovered this recipe was common,to each of these frauds.,In other words, a coroner could find these things,because this is a fatal recipe,that will destroy the banks,as well as the economy.,And it also turns out to be precisely,what could have stopped this crisis,,the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars,just in the household sector,,that cost us 10 million jobs,,was the easiest financial crisis by far,to have avoided completely,if we had simply learned the lessons,of epidemics of control fraud,,particularly using this recipe.,So let's go to this crisis,,and the two huge epidemics,of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --,appraisal fraud and liar's loans --,and what we're going to see,in looking at both of these is,we got warnings that were incredibly early,about these frauds.,We got warnings that we couldnhave taken advantage of easily,,because back in the savings and loan debacle,,we had figured out how to respond,and prevent these crises.,And three, the warnings were unambiguous.,They were obvious that what was going on,was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up. 
 Let's take appraisal fraud first.,This is simply where you inflate the value,of the home that is being pledged,as security for the loan.,In 2000, the year 2000,,that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,,the honest appraisers got together a formal petition,begging the federal government to act,,and the industry to act,,to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.,And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,,that banks were demanding that appraisers,inflate the appraisal,,and that if the appraisers refused to do so,,they, the banks, would blacklist,honest appraisers,and refuse to use them.,Now, we've seen this before,in the savings and loan debacle,,and we know that this kind of fraud,can only originate from the lenders,,and that no honest lender would ever inflate,the appraisal,,because it's the great protection against loss.,So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.,It was something we'd seen before,,and it was completely unambiguous.,This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud,led by the banks. 
 What about liar's loans?,Well, that warning actually comes earlier.,The savings and loan debacle is basically,the early 1980s through 1993,,and in the midst of fighting that wave,of accounting control fraud,,in 1990, we found that a second front,of fraud was being started.,And like all good financial frauds in America,,it began in Orange County, California.,And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.,And our examiners said,,they are making loans without even checking,what the borrower's income is.,This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,,and it only makes sense for entities engaged,in these accounting control frauds.,And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,,and we drove those liar's loans,out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,,but we could only deal with the industry,we had jurisdiction over,,which was savings and loans,,and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,,Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up,its federal savings and loan charter,,gave up federal deposit insurance,,converted to become a mortgage bank,for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,,and changed its name to Ameriquest,,and became the most notorious,of the liar's loans frauds early on,,and to add to that,,they deliberately predated upon minorities. 
 So we knew again about this crisis.,We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.,We had incredibly early warnings of it,,and it was absolutely unambiguous,that no honest lender wouldnmake loans in this fashion.,So let's take a look at the reaction,of the industry and the regulators,and the prosecutors to these clear,early warnings that could have prevented the crisis. 
 Start with the industry.,The industry responded between 2003 and 2006,by increasing liar's loans,by over 500 percent.,These were the loans,that hyperinflated the bubble,and produced the economic crisis.,By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime,were also liar's loans.,They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,,they're the most toxic combination,you can possibly imagine.,By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans,made that year, all the home loans made that year,,were liar's loans,,40 percent.,And this is despite a warning,from the industry's own antifraud experts,that said that these loans were an open invitation,to fraudsters,,and that they had a fraud incidence,of 90 percent,,nine zero.,In response to that, the industry,first started calling these loans liar's loans,,which lacks a certain subtlety,,and second, massively increased them,,and no government regulator ever,required or encouraged any lender,to make a liar's loan,or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,,and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.,This came from the lenders,because of the fraud recipe. 
 What happened to appraisal fraud?,It expanded remarkably as well.,By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,,90 percent of appraisers reported,that they had been subject to coercion,from the lenders trying to get them,to inflate an appraisal.,In other words, both forms of fraud,became absolutely endemic and normal,,and this is what drove the bubble. 
 What happened in the governmental sector?,Well, the government, as I told you,,when we were the savings and loan regulators,,we could only deal with our industry,,and if people gave up theirnfederal deposit insurance,,we couldn't do anything to them.,Congress, it may strike you as impossible,,but actually did something intelligent in 1994,,and passed the Home Ownershipnand Equity Protection Act,that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,,the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans,by every lender,,whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.,So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,,as chairs of the Fed, do,when they got these warnings,that these were massively fraudulent loans,and that they were being soldnto the secondary market?,Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.,Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,,it can only be sold to the secondary market,through more frauds,,lying about the reps and warrantees,,and then those people are going to produce,mortgage-backed securities,and exotic derivatives,which are also going to be supposedly backed,by those fraudulent loans.,So the fraud is going to progress,through the entire system,,hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.,And remember, we had experience with this.,We had seen significant losses,,and we had experience of competent regulators,in stopping it.,Greenspan and Bernanke refused,to use the authority under the statute,to stop liar's loans.,And this was a matter first of dogma.,They're just horrifically opposed,to anything regulatory.,But it is also the international competition in laxity,,the race to the bottom,between the United States and the United Kingdom,,the city of London, in particular,,and the city of London won that race to the bottom,,but it meant that all regulation in the West,was completely degraded,in this stupid competition to be,who could have the weakest regulation. 
 So that was the regulatory response.,What about the response of the prosecutors,after the crisis,,after 11 trillion dollars in losses,,after 10 million jobs lost,,a crisis in which the losses and the frauds,were more than 70 times larger,than the savings and loan debacle?,Well, in the savings and loan debacle,,our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,,made over 30,000 criminal referrals,,produced over 1,000 felony convictions,just in cases designated as major,,and that understates the degree of prioritization,,because we worked with the FBI,to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,,the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.,Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,,roughly 600 senior officials.,Virtually all of them were prosecuted.,We had a 90 percent conviction rate.,It's the greatest success against,elite white collar criminals ever,,and it was because of this understanding,of control fraud,and the accounting control fraud mechanism. 
 Flash forward to the current crisis.,The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,,which was supposed to regulate,many of the largest makers of liar's loans,in the country,,has made, even today -- it no longer exists,,but as of a year ago,,it had made zero criminal referrals.,The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,,which is supposed to regulatenthe largest national banks,,has made zero criminal referrals.,The Fed appears to have made,zero criminal referrals.,The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.,Without any guidance from the regulators,,there's no expertise in the FBI,to investigate complex frauds.,It isn't simply that they've had,to reinvent the wheel,of how to do these prosecutions;,they've forgotten that the wheel exists,,and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,,and of course, zero convictions,,of any of the elite bank frauds,,the Wall Street types,,that drove this crisis. 
 With no expertise coming from the regulators,,the FBI formed what it calls a partnership,with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.,The Mortgage Bankers Association,is the trade association of the perps.,And the Mortgage Bankers Association,set out, it had the audacity and the success,to con the FBI.,It had created a supposed definition,of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,,its members are always the victim,and never the perpetrators.,And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,,rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.,And so the FBI,,under the leadership of an attorney general,who is African-American,and a president of the UnitednStates who is African-American,,have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,,in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,,conceived without sin in the executive ranks.,And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers,who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,,who lack any financial sophistication.,It is the silliest story you can conceive of,,and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,,and they leave the banksters alone entirely.,And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,,the FBI is chasing mice. 
 What do we need to do?,What can we do in all of this?,We need to change the perverse incentive structures,that produce these recurrent epidemics,of accounting control fraud,that are driving our crises.,So we have to first get rid,of the systemically dangerous institutions.,These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.,We need to shrink them to the point,,within the next five years,,that they no longer pose a systemic risk.,Right now, they are ticking time bombs,that will cause a global crisis,as soon as the next one fails --,not if, when.,Second thing we need to do is completely reform,modern executive and professional compensation,,which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.,Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers,through the compensation system,,trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,,in which bad ethics drives good ethics,out of the marketplace.,And they largely succeeded,,which is how the fraud became endemic.,And the third thing that we need to do,is deal with what we call the three D's:,deregulation, desupervision,,and the de facto decriminalization.,Because we can make,all three of these changes, and if we do so,,we can dramatically reduce,how often we have a crisis,and how severe those crises are.,That is not simply critical to our economy.,You can see what these crises do to inequality,and what they do to our democracy.,They have produced crony capitalism,,American-style,,in which the largest financial institutions,are the leading financial donors of both parties,,and that's the reason why,even after this crisis,,70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,,we have no meaningful reforms,in any of the three areas that I've talked about,,other than banning liar's loans,,which is good,,but that's just one form of ammunition,for this fraud weapon.,There are many forms of ammunition they can use. 
 That's why we need to learn,what the bankers have learned:,the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,,so that we can stop that recipe,,because our legislators,,who are dependent on political contributions,,will not do it on their own. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk to you tonight,about coming out of the closet,,and not in the traditional sense,,not just the gay closet.,I think we all have closets.,Your closet may be telling someone,you love her for the first time,,or telling someone that you're pregnant,,or telling someone you have cancer,,or any of the other hard conversations,we have throughout our lives.,All a closet is is a hard conversation,,and although our topics may vary tremendously,,the experience of being in,and coming out of the closet is universal.,It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done. 
 Several years ago,,I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,,a local diner in town,,and during my time there I would go through phases,of militant lesbian intensity:,not shaving my armpits,,quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.,And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts,and how recently I had shaved my head,,the question would often be sprung on me,,usually by a little kid: 
 "Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?" 
 And there would be an awkward silence at the table.,I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,,hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.,The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper,and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.,But I would say nothing,,and I would seethe inside.,And it got to the point where every time I walked up,to a table that had a kid anywhere betweennthree and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.,(Laughter),And that is a terrible feeling.,So I promised myself, the nextntime, I would say something.,I would have that hard conversation. 
 So within a matter of weeks, it happens again. 
 "Are you a boy or are you a girl?" 
 Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,,and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101,on this table. (Laughter),I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.,I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.,I've even got this little bit fromn"Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.,So I take a deep breath and I look down,and staring back at me is anfour-year-old girl in a pink dress,,not a challenge to a feminist duel,,just a kid with a question:,"Are you a boy or are you a girl?" 
 So I take another deep breath,,squat down to next to her, and say,,"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.,My hair is short like a boy's,,and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,,and you know how sometimesnyou like to wear a pink dress,,and sometimes you like tonwear your comfy jammies?,Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl." 
 And this kid looks me dead in the eye,,without missing a beat, and says,,"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.,Can I get a pancake, please?",(Laughter),And that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.,How about that pancake?" 
 It was the easiest hard conversation,I have ever had.,And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,,we were both real with each other. 
 So like many of us,,I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,,most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.,But inside, in the dark,,you can't tell what color the walls are.,You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.,So really, my closet is no different than yours,or yours or yours.,Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons,why coming out of my closet wasnharder than coming out of yours,,but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.,Hard is hard.,Who can tell me that explaining tonsomeone you've just declared bankruptcy,is harder than telling someonenyou just cheated on them?,Who can tell me that his coming out story,is harder than telling your five-year-old nyou're getting a divorce?,There is no harder, there is just hard.,We need to stop ranking our hardnagainst everyone else's hard,to make us feel better or worse about our closets,and just commiserate on the nfact that we all have hard.,At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,,and they may feel safe,,or at least safer than what liesnon the other side of that door.,But I am here to tell you,,no matter what your walls are made of,,a closet is no place for a person to live. 
 Thanks. (Applause) 
 So imagine yourself 20 years ago.,Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,,and high-heeled shoes.,I was not the militant lesbian,ready to fight any four-year-oldnthat walked into the cafe.,I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner,of my pitch-black closet,clutching my gay grenade,,and moving one muscle is the scariest thing,I have ever done.,My family, my friends, complete strangers --,I had spent my entire life,trying to not disappoint these people,,and now I was turning the world upside down,on purpose.,I was burning the pages of the script,we had all followed for so long,,but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you. 
 One of my most memorable grenade tosses,was at my sister's wedding.,(Laughter),It was the first time that many in attendance,knew I was gay, so in doing nmy maid of honor duties,,in my black dress and heels,,I walked around to tables,and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,,folks that had known me for years.,And after a little small talk,none of the women shouted out,,"I love Nathan Lane!",And the battle of gay relatability had begun. 
 "Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?" 
 "Well, yeah, actually, we havenfriends in San Francisco." 
 "Well, we've never been therenbut we've heard it's fabulous." 
 "Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?,He's really good and he hasnnever talked about a girlfriend." 
 "Ash, what's your favorite TV show?,Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.,And you know who we love? Jack.,Jack is our favorite." 
 And then one woman, stumped,but wanting so desperately to show her support,,to let me know she was on my side,,she finally blurted out,,"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts.",(Laughter) 
 And I had a choice in that moment,,as all grenade throwers do.,I could go back to my girlfriendnand my gay-loving table,and mock their responses,,chastise their unworldliness and their inability,to jump through the politically correct ngay hoops I had brought with me,,or I could empathize with them,and realize that that was maybe one ofnthe hardest things they had ever done,,that starting and having that conversation,was them coming out of their closets.,Sure, it would have been easynto point out where they felt short.,It's a lot harder to meet them where they are,and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.,And what else can you ask someone to do but try?,If you're going to be real with someone,,you gotta be ready for real in return. 
 So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.,Ask anybody I have ever dated.,But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call,the three Pancake Girl principles.,Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,,but know what it takes to come out of any closet,is essentially the same. 
 Number one: Be authentic.,Take the armor off. Be yourself.,That kid in the cafe had no armor,,but I was ready for battle.,If you want someone to be real with you,,they need to know that you bleed too. 
 Number two: Be direct. Justnsay it. Rip the Band-Aid off.,If you know you are gay, just say it.,If you tell your parents you might be gay,,they will hold out hope that this will change.,Do not give them that sense of false hope.,(Laughter) 
 And number three, and most important --,(Laughter),Be unapologetic.,You are speaking your truth.,Never apologize for that.,And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,,so sure, apologize for what you've done,,but never apologize for who you are.,And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,,but that is on them, not on you.,Those are their expectationsnof who you are, not yours.,That is their story, not yours.,The only story that matters,is the one that you want to write.,So the next time you find yourself,in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,,know we have all been there before.,And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.,And we know it's hard but we need you out here,,no matter what your walls are made of,,because I guarantee you there are others,peering through the keyholes of their closets,looking for the next brave soul tonbust a door open, so be that person,and show the world that wenare bigger than our closets,and that a closet is no place for a person,to truly live. 
 Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)"Pheromone" is a very powerful word.,It conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,,and you can see, it's very important as a word.,But it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.,Now, if you put that word into the web,,as you may have done,,you'll come up with millions of hits,,and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you,something to make you irresistible,for 10 dollars or more.,Now, this is a very attractive idea,,and the molecules they mention,sound really science-y.,They've got lots of syllables.,It's things like androstenol, androstenone,or androstadienone.,It gets better and better,,and when you combine that with white lab coats,,you must imagine that there is,fantastic science behind this.,But sadly, these are fraudulent claims,supported by dodgy science. 
 The problem is that, although there are many,good scientists working on what they think,are human pheromones,,and they're publishing in respectable journals,,at the basis of this,,despite very sophisticated experiments,,there really is no good science behind it,,because it's based on a problem,,which is nobody has systematically gone through,all the odors that humans produce --,and there are thousands ofnmolecules that we give off.,We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.,Nobody has gone through systematically,to work out which molecules really are pheromones.,They've just plucked a few,,and all these experiments are based on those,,but there's no good evidence at all. 
 Now, that's not to say,that smell is not important to people.,It is, and some people are real enthusiasts,,and one of these was Napoleon.,And famously, you may remember,that out on the campaign trail for war,,he wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,,saying, "Don't wash. I'm coming home.",(Laughter),So he didn't want to lose any of her richness,in the days before he'd get home,,and it is still, you'll find websites,that offer this as a major quirk.,At the same time, though,,we spend about as much money,taking the smells off us,as putting them back on in perfumes,,and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business. 
 So what I want to do in the rest of this talk,is tell you about what pheromones really are,,tell you why I think we would expect,humans to have pheromones,,tell you about some of thenconfusions in pheromones,,and then finally, I want to end with,a promising avenue which shows us,the way we ought to be going. 
 So the ancient Greeks knew,that dogs sent invisible signals between each other.,A female dog in heat,sent an invisible signal to male dogs,for miles around,,and it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.,You could take the smell from the female dog,,and the dogs would chase the cloth.,But the problem for everybody,who could see this effect,was that you couldn't identify the molecules.,You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.,The reason for that, of course,,is that each of these animals,produces tiny quantities,,and in the case of the dog,,males dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.,And it was only in 1959 that a German team,,after spending 20 years innsearch of these molecules,,discovered, identified, the first pheromone,,and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.,Now, this was an inspired choice nby Adolf Butenandt and his team,,because he needed half a million moths,to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.,But he created the model,for how you should go about pheromone analysis.,He basically went through systematically,,showing that only the molecule in question,was the one that stimulated the males,,not all the others.,He analyzed it very carefully.,He synthesized the molecule,,and then tried the synthesizednmolecule on the males,and got them to respond and showed it was,,indeed, that molecule.,That's closing the circle.,That's the thing which hasnnever been done with humans:,nothing systematic, no real demonstration. 
 With that new concept,,we needed a new word,,and that was the word "pheromone,",and it's basically transferred excitement,,transferred between individuals,,and since 1959, pheromones have been found,right the way across the animal kingdom,,in male animals, in female animals.,It works just as well underwater,for goldfish and lobsters.,And almost every mammal you can think of,has had a pheromone identified,,and of course, an enormous number of insects. 
 So we know that pheromones exist,right the way across the animal kingdom.,What about humans?,Well, the first thing, of course,,is that we're mammals,,and mammals are smelly.,As any dog owner can tell you,,we smell, they smell. 
 But the real reason we might think,that humans have pheromones,is the change that occurs as we grow up.,The smell of a room of teenagers,is quite different,from the smell of a room of small children.,What's changed? And of course, it's puberty.,Along with the pubic hair,and the hair in the armpits,,new glands start to secrete in those places,,and that's what's making the change in smell.,If we were any other kind of mammal,,or any other kind of animal,,we would say,,"That must be something to do with pheromones,",and we'd start looking properly. 
 But there are some problems, and this is why,,I think, people have not looked for,pheromones so effectively in humans.,There are, indeed, problems.,And the first of these,is perhaps surprising.,It's all about culture.,Now moths don't learn a lot,about what is good to smell, but humans do,,and up to the age of about four,,any smell, no matter how rancid,,is simply interesting.,And I understand that the major role of parents,is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,,because it's always something nice to smell.,But gradually we learn what's not good,,and one of the things we learn,at the same time as what is not good,is what is good. 
 Now, the cheese behind me,is a British, if not an English, delicacy.,It's ripe blue Stilton.,Liking it is incomprehensible tonpeople from other countries.,Every culture has its own special food,and national delicacy.,If you were to come from Iceland,,your national dish,is deep rotted shark.,Now, all of these things are acquired tastes,,but they form almost a badge of identity.,You're part of the in-group. 
 The second thing is the sense of smell.,Each of us has a unique odor world,,in the sense that what we smell,,we each smell a completely different world.,Now, smell was the hardest,of the senses to crack,,and the Nobel Prize awarded to,Richard Axel and Linda Buck,was only awarded in 2004,for their discovery of how smell works.,It's really hard,,but in essence, nerves from the brain,go up into the nose,and on these nerves exposed in the nose,to the outside air are receptors,,and odor molecules coming in on a sniff,interact with these receptors,,and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal,which goes back into the brain.,We don't just have one kind of receptor.,If you're a human, you have about 400,different kinds of receptors,,and the brain knows what you're smelling,because of the combination of receptors,and nerve cells that they trigger,,sending messages up to the brain,in a combinatorial fashion.,But it's a bit more complicated,,because each of those 400,comes in various variants,,and depending which variant you have,,you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,,either as something delicious and savory,or something like soap.,So we each have an individual world of smell,,and that complicates anything,when we're studying smell. 
 Well, we really ought to talk about armpits,,and I have to say that I donhave particularly good ones.,Now, I'm not going to share them with you,,but this is the place that most people,have looked for pheromones.,There is one good reason,,which is, the great apes have armpits,as their unique characteristic.,The other primates have scent glands,in other parts of the body.,The great apes have these armpits,full of secretory glands,producing smells all the time,,enormous numbers of molecules.,When they're secreted from the glands,,the molecules are odorless.,They have no smell at all,,and it's only the wonderful bacteria,growing on the rainforest of hair,that actually produces the smells,that we know and love.,And so incidentally, if you want to reduce,the amount of smell,,clear-cutting your armpits,is a very effective way of reducing,the habitat for bacteria,,and you'll find they remain less smelly,for much longer.,But although we've focused on armpits,,I think it's partly because they're the least,embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.,There is actually another reason why we might not,be looking for a universal sex pheromone there,,and that's because 20 percentnof the world's population,doesn't have smelly armpits like me.,And these are people from China, Japan,,Korea, and other parts of northeast Asia.,They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors,that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells,that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of,as characteristic of armpits.,So it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world. 
 So what should we be doing,in our search for human pheromones?,I'm fairly convinced that we do have them.,We're mammals, like everybody else,who's a mammal, and we probably do have them.,But what I think we should do,is go right back to the beginning,,and basically look all over the body.,No matter how embarrassing,,we need to search and go for the first time,where no one else has dared tread.,It's going to be difficult,,it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.,We also need to go back to the ideas,that Butenandt used when henwas studying the silk moth.,We need to go back and look systematically,at all the molecules that are being produced,,and work out which ones are really involved.,It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple,and say, "They'll do.",We have to actually demonstrate,that they really have the effects we claim. 
 There is one team that I'mnactually very impressed by.,They're in France, and their previous success,was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.,They've turned their attention now,to human babies and mothers. 
 So this is a baby having a drink of milk,from its mother's breast.,Her nipple is completely hidden,by the baby's head,,but what you'll notice is a white droplet,with an arrow pointing to it,,and that's the secretion from the areolar glands.,Now, we all have them, men and women,,and these are the little bumps around the nipple,,and if you're a lactating woman,,these start to secrete.,It's a very interesting secretion.,What Benoist Schaal and his team developed,was a simple test to investigate,what the effect of this secretion might be,,in effect, a simple bioassay.,So this is a sleeping baby,,and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.,The baby remains sleeping,,showing no interest at all.,But if we go to any mother,who is secreting from the areolar glands,,so it's not about recognition,,it can be from any mother,,if we take the secretion,and now put it under the baby's nose,,we get a very different reaction.,It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,,and it opens its mouth,and sticks out its tongue,and starts to suck.,Now, since this is from any mother,,it could really be a pheromone.,It's not about individual recognition.,Any mother will do. 
 Now, why is this important,,apart from being simply very interesting?,It's because women vary,in the number of areolar glands that they have,,and there is a correlation between the ease,with which babies start to suckle,and the number of areolar glands she has.,It appears that the more secretions she's got,,the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.,If you're a mammal,,the most dangerous time in life,is the first few hours after birth.,You have to get that first drink of milk,,and if you don't get it, you won't survive.,You'll be dead.,Since many babies actually find it difficult,to take that first meal,,because they're not getting the right stimulus,,if we could identify what that molecule was,,and the French team are being very cautious,,but if we could identify the molecule,,synthesize it, it would then mean,premature babies would be more likely to suckle,,and every baby would have a better chance,of survival.,So what I want to argue is this is one example,of where a systematic, really scientific approach,can actually bring you a real understanding,of pheromones.,There could be all sorts of medical interventions.,There could be all sorts of things,that humans are doing with pheromones,that we simply don't know at the moment.,What we need to remember is pheromones,are not just about sex.,They're about all sorts of things to do,with a mammal's life.,So do go forward and do search for more.,There's lots to find. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I wanted to tell a story,that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,,and it's a story of something that happened,3,000 years ago,,when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.,And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah,in what is now Israel.,And the reason the story obsessed me is that,I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it,and I realized that I didn't understand it at all. 
 Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,,there's a mountain range.,Still same is true of Israel today.,And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities,of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.,And then there's a coastal plain,along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.,And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain,is an area called the Shephelah,,which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,,and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah,to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.,And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know,it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.,It's gorgeous, with forests of oak,and wheat fields and vineyards. 
 But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,,it's served, it's had a real strategic function,,and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies,on the coastal plain find their way,,get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.,And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.,The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies,of the Kingdom of Israel,,are living in the coastal plain.,They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.,And they may start to make their way,through one of the valleys of the Shephelah,up into the mountains,,because what they want to do is occupy the highland area,right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.,And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,,obviously catches wind of this,,and Saul brings his army down from the mountains,and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,,one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.,And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,,and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,,and the two armies just sit there for weeks,and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.,Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side,you've got to come down the mountain into the valley,and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed. 
 So finally, to break the deadlock,,the Philistines send their mightiest warrior,down into the valley floor, and he calls out,and he says to the Israelites,,"Send your mightiest warrior down,,and we'll have this out, just the two of us." 
 This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.,It was a way of settling disputes,without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.,And the Philistine who is sent down,,their mighty warrior, is a giant.,He's 6 foot 9.,He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,,and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin,and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.,And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.,It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him. 
 And finally the only person who will come forward,is this young shepherd boy,,and he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him." 
 And Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.,You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior." 
 But the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,,you don't understand, I have been defending my flock,against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it." 
 And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.,So he says, "All right.",And then he turns to the kid, and he says,,"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are." 
 So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,,and the shepherd says, "No.",He says, "I can't wear this stuff.",The Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,",meaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy." 
 So he reaches down instead on the ground,and picks up five stones,and puts them in his shepherd's bag,and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.,And the giant sees this figure approaching,,and calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh,to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.",He issues this kind of taunt towards this person,coming to fight him.,And the shepherd draws closer and closer,,and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.,That's all he's carrying.,Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,,and he says -- he's insulted --,"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?" 
 And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones,out of his pocket, puts it in his sling,and rolls it around and lets it fly,and it hits the giant right between the eyes --,right here, in his most vulnerable spot --,and he falls down either dead or unconscious,,and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword,and cuts off his head,,and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run. 
 And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath,and the name of the shepherd boy is David,,and the reason that story has obsessed me,over the course of writing my book,is that everything I thought I knew about that story,turned out to be wrong. 
 So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?,In fact, that term, David and Goliath,,has entered our language as a metaphor for,improbable victories,by some weak party over someone far stronger.,Now why do we call David an underdog?,Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,,a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.,We also call him an underdog,because Goliath is an experienced warrior,,and David is just a shepherd.,But most importantly, we call him an underdog,because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with,all of this modern weaponry,,this glittering coat of armor,and a sword and a javelin and a spear,,and all David has is this sling. 
 Well, let's start there with the phrase,"All David has is this sling,",because that's the first mistake that we make.,In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.,There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.,There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,,armed foot soldiers with swords and shields,and some kind of armor.,And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,,but, more importantly, slingers.,And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch,with two long cords attached to it,,and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,,inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this,and they let one of the cords go,,and the effect is to send the projectile forward,towards its target.,That's what David has, and it's important to understand,that that sling is not a slingshot.,It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.,It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.,When David rolls it around like this,,he's turning the sling around probably,at six or seven revolutions per second,,and that means that when the rock is released,,it's going forward really fast,,probably 35 meters per second.,That's substantially faster than a baseball,thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.,More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah,were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,,which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.,If you do the calculations on the ballistics,,on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,,it's roughly equal to the stopping power,of a [.45 caliber] handgun.,This is an incredibly devastating weapon.,Accuracy, we know from historical records,that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit,and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.,From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers,were capable of hitting birds in flight.,They were incredibly accurate.,When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,,he's quite close to Goliath --,when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,,he has every intention and every expectation,of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot,between his eyes.,If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,,you will find time and time again,that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry,in one kind of battle or another. 
 So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,,and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel,is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.,When he says, "Come to me that I might,feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,",the key phrase is "Come to me.",Come up to me because we're going to fight,,hand to hand, like this.,Saul has the same expectation.,David says, "I want to fight Goliath,",and Saul tries to give him his armor,,because Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,',you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,',infantry on infantry." 
 But David has absolutely no expectation.,He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?,He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career,using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.,That's where his strength lies.,So here he is, this shepherd, experienced,in the use of a devastating weapon,,up against this lumbering giant,weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor,and these incredibly heavy weapons,that are useful only in short-range combat.,Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.,So why do we keep calling David an underdog,,and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable? 
 There's a second piece of this that's important.,It's not just that we misunderstand David,and his choice of weaponry.,It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.,Goliath is not what he seems to be.,There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,,things that are in retrospect quite puzzling,and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.,So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath,is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.,Now that is weird, right?,Here is this mighty warrior,challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.,Why is he being led by the hand,by some young boy, presumably,,to the point of combat?,Secondly, the Bible story makes special note,of how slowly Goliath moves,,another odd thing to say when you're describing,the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.,And then there's this whole weird thing,about how long it takes Goliath to react,to the sight of David.,So David's coming down the mountain,,and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.,There is nothing about him that says,,"I am about to fight you like this.",He's not even carrying a sword.,Why does Goliath not react to that?,It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.,And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:,"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?",Sticks? David only has one stick. 
 Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal,of speculation within the medical community over the years,about whether there is something,fundamentally wrong with Goliath,,an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.,There have been many articles written.,The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,,and it started a chain of speculation,that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.,So Goliath is head and shoulders above,all of his peers in that era,,and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,,there's an explanation for it.,So the most common form of giantism,is a condition called acromegaly,,and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor,on your pituitary gland,that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.,And throughout history, many of the most famous giants,have all had acromegaly.,So the tallest person of all time,was a guy named Robert Wadlow,who was still growing when he died at the age of 24,and he was 8 foot 11.,He had acromegaly.,Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?,Famous. He had acromegaly.,There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.,Anyone who's unusually tall,,that's the first explanation we come up with.,And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects,associated with it,,principally having to do with vision.,The pituitary tumor, as it grows,,often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,,with the result that people with acromegaly,have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted. 
 So when people have started to speculate,about what might have been wrong with Goliath,,they've said, "Wait a minute,,he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone,who has acromegaly.",And that would also explain so much of what was strange,about his behavior that day.,Why does he move so slowly,and have to be escorted down into the valley floor,by an attendant?,Because he can't make his way on his own.,Why is he so strangely oblivious to David,that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him,until the very last moment?,Because he can't see him.,When he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh,to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,",the phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.,Come to me because I can't see you.,And then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?",He sees two sticks when David has only one. 
 So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge,looking down on him thought he was,this extraordinarily powerful foe.,What they didn't understand was that,the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength,was also the source of his greatest weakness. 
 And there is, I think, in that,,a very important lesson for all of us.,Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.,And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk about hackers.,And the image that comes to your mind,when I say that word is probably not,of Benjamin Franklin,,but I'm going to explain to you why it should be. 
 The image that comes to your mind,is probably more likely of a pasty kid,sitting in a basement doing something mischievous,,or of a shady criminal who isntrying to steal your identity,,or of an international rogue,with a political agenda.,And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea,that hackers are people that we should be afraid of. 
 But like most things in technology,and the technology world,,hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.,For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity,there's one that's building a tool,that will help you find yournloved ones after a disaster,or to monitor environmental quality,after an oil spill.,Hacking is really just any amateur innovation,on an existing system,,and it is a deeply democratic activity.,It's about critical thinking.,It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.,It's the idea that if you see a nproblem, you work to fix it,,and not just complain about it.,And in many ways, hacking is what built America.,Betsy Ross was a hacker.,The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.,And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,,hacking has always been at the foundation,of American democracy. 
 So if there's one thing I wantnto leave you here with today,,it's that the next time younthink about who a hacker is,,you think not of this guy,but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,,who was one of the greatest hackers of all time.,He was one of America's most prolific inventors,,though he famously never filed a patent,,because he thought that all human knowledge,should be freely available.,He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,,and of course there was his collaboration,on the invention of American democracy. 
 And in Code For America, we really try to embody,the spirit of Ben Franklin.,He was a tinkerer and a statesman,whose conception of citizenship,was always predicated on action.,He believed that government could be built,by the people,,and we call those people civic hackers. 
 So it's no wonder that the values,that underly a healthy democracy,,like collaboration and empowerment,and participation and enterprise,,are the same values that underly the Internet.,And so it's no surprise that many hackers,are turning their attention tonthe problem of government. 
 But before I give you a few examples,of what civic hacking looks like,,I want to make clear that you don't have,to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.,You just have to believe that you can bring,a 21st-century tool set to bear,on the problems that government faces.,And we hear all the time from our community,of civic hackers at Code for America,that they didn't understandnhow much nontechnical work,actually went into civic hacking projects.,So keep that in mind.,All of you are potential civic hackers. 
 So what does civic hacking look like?,Our team last year in Honolulu,,which in this case was three full-time fellows,who were doing a year of public service,,were asked by the city to rebuild the website.,And it's a massive thing ofntens of thousands of pages,which just wasn't going to be possible,in the few months that they had.,So instead, they decided to build a parallel site,that better conformed to how citizens actually,want to interact with information on a city website.,They're looking for answers to questions,,and they want to take action when they're done,,which is really hard to do from a site,that looks like this.,So our team built Honolulu Answers,,which is a super-simple search interface,where you enter a search term or a question,and get back plain language answers,that drive a user towards action.,Now the site itself was easy enough to build,,but the team was faced with the challenge,of how they populate all of the content.,It would have taken the three of them,a very long time,,especially given that none of nthem are actually from Honolulu.,And so they did something that's really radical,,when you think about how government,is used to working.,They asked citizens to write the content.,So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.,They held a write-a-thon,,where on one Saturday afternoon --,("What do I do about wild pigs nbeing a nuisance?") (Laughter) —,Wild pigs are a huge problem nin Honolulu, apparently.,In one Saturday afternoon,,they were able to populate most of the content,for most of the frequently asked questions,,but more importantly than that,,they created a new way for citizens nto participate in their government. 
 Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,,but it gets more awesome.,On the National Day of Civic Hacking,this past June in Oakland, where I live,,the Code For America team in Oakland,took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers,and turned it into Oakland Answers,,and again we held a write-a-thon,where we took the most frequently asked questions,and had citizens write the answers to them,,and I got into the act.,I authored this answer, and a few others.,And I'm trying to this day to articulate,the sense of empowerment and responsibility,that I feel for the place that I live,based simply on this small act of participation.,And by stitching together my small act,with the thousands of othernsmall acts of participation,that we're enabling through civic hacking,,we think we can reenergize citizenship,and restore trust in government. 
 At this point, you may be wondering,what city officials think of all this.,They actually love it.,As most of you guys know, cities are being asked,every day to do more with less,,and they're always looking for innovative solutions,to entrenched problems.,So when you give citizens a way to participate,beyond attending a town hall meeting,,cities can actually capture,the capacity in their communities,to do the business of government. 
 Now I don't want to leave the impression,that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.,It's happening across the globe,,and one of my favorite examples,is from Mexico City, where earlier this year,,the Mexico House of Representatives,entered into a contract withna software development firm,to build an app that legislators would use,to track bills.,So this was just for the handful of legislators,in the House.,And the contract was a two-year contract,for 9.3 million dollars.,Now a lot of people were really angry about this,,especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars,was an absolutely outrageous amount of money,for what was a very simple app.,But instead of taking to the streets,,they issued a challenge.,They asked programmers in Mexico,to build something better and cheaper,,and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --,10,000 times cheaper,than the government contract,,and they gave the entrants 10 days.,And in those 10 days,,they submitted 173 apps,,five of which were presented to Congress,and are still in the app store today.,And because of this action,,that contract was vacated,,and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City,which is home to one of our partners,,Code for Mexico City. 
 And so what you see in all three of these places,,in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,,are the elements that arenat the core of civic hacking.,It's citizens who saw thingsnthat could be working better,and they decided to fix them,,and through that work, they're creating,a 21st-century ecosystem of participation.,They're creating a whole new set of ways,for citizens to be involved,,besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.,They can actually build government. 
 So back to our friend Ben Franklin,,who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments,was that in 1736 he founded,the first volunteer firefightingncompany in Philadelphia,,called a brigade.,And it's because he and his friends noticed,that the city was having trouble keeping up,with all the fires that were happening in the city,,so in true civic hacker fashion,,they built a solution. 
 And we have our own brigades at Code for America,working on the projects that I've just described,,and we want to ask you,to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps,and come join us.,We have 31 brigades in the U.S.,We are pleased to announce today,that we're opening up the nbrigade to international cities,for the first time,,starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.,You can find out if there's a brigade where you live,at brigade.codeforamerica.org,,and if there's not a brigadenwhere you live, we will help you.,We've created a tool kit which also lives,at brigade.codeforamerica.org,,and we will support you along the way.,Our goal is to create a globalnnetwork of civic hackers,who are innovating on the existing system,in order to build tools that will solve,entrenched problems,,that will support local government,,and that will empower citizens. 
 So please come hack with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to show you how,architecture has helped,to change the life of my community,and has opened opportunities to hope. 
 I am a native of Burkina Faso.,According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso,is one of the poorest countries in the world,,but what does it look like,to grow up in a place like that?,I am an example of that.,I was born in a little village called Gando.,In Gando, there was no electricity,,no access to clean drinking water, and no school.,But my father wanted me,to learn how to read and write.,For this reason, I had to leave my family,when I was seven and to stay in a city,far away from my village,with no contact with my family.,In this place I sat,in a class like that,with more than 150 other kids,,and for six years.,In this time, it just happened to me to come to school,to realize that my classmate died. 
 Today, not so much has changed.,There is still no electricity in my village.,People still are dying in Burkina Faso,,and access to clean drinking water,is still a big problem. 
 I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life,when you grow up in a place like that.,But I was lucky.,I had a scholarship.,I could go to Germany to study. 
 So now, I suppose,,I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege,it is for me to be standing before you today.,From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,,to Berlin in Germany to become an architect,is a big, big step.,But what to do with this privilege?,Since I was a student, I wanted to open up,better opportunities to other kids in Gando.,I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.,But how do you do it when you're still a student,and you don't have money?,Oh yes, I started to make drawings,and asked for money.,Fundraising was not an easy task.,I even asked my classmates,to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,,but to sponsor my school project.,In real wonder, two years later,,I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars. 
 When I came home to Gando,to bring the good news,,my people were over the moon,,but when they realized,that I was planning to use clay,,they were shocked. 
 "A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,,and Francis wants us to use it and build a school.,Is this the reason why he spent so much time,in Europe studying,instead of working in the field with us?" 
 My people build all the time with clay,,but they don't see any innovation with mud.,So I had to convince everybody.,I started to speak with the community,,and I could convince everybody,,and we could start to work.,And the women, the men,,everybody from the village,,was part of this building process.,I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.,So clay floor for example,,the young men come and stand like that, beating,,hours for hours,,and then their mothers came,,and they are beating in this position,,for hours, giving water and beating.,And then the polishers come.,They start polishing it with a stone for hours.,And then you have this result,,very fine, like a baby bottom.,(Laughter),It's not photoshopped. (Laughter),This is the school, built with the community.,The walls are totally made out,of compressed clay blocks from Gando.,The roof structure is made,with cheap steel bars,normally hiding inside concrete.,And the classroom, the ceiling is made,out of both of them used together. 
 In this school, there was a simple idea:,to create comfort in a classroom.,Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,,so with simple ventilation,,I wanted to make the classroom,good for teaching and learning.,And this is the project today,,12 years old, still in best condition.,And the kids, they love it. 
 And for me and my community,,this project was a huge success.,It has opened up opportunities,to do more projects in Gando.,So I could do a lot of projects,,and here I am going to share with you,only three of them. 
 The first one is the school extension, of course.,How do you explain drawings and engineering,to people who are neither able to read nor write?,I started to build a prototype like that.,The innovation was to build a clay vault.,So then, I jumped on the top like that,,with my team, and it works.,The community is looking. It still works.,So we can build. (Laughter),And we kept building, and that is the result.,The kids are happy, and they love it.,The community is very proud. We made it.,And even animals, like these donkeys,,love our buildings.,(Laughter) 
 The next project is the library in Gando.,And see now, we tried to introduce,different ideas in our buildings,,but we often don't have so much material.,Something we have in Gando are clay pots.,We wanted to use them to create openings.,So we just bring them like you can see,to the building site.,we start cutting them,,and then we place them on top of the roof,before we pour the concrete,,and you have this result.,The openings are letting the hot air out,and light in.,Very simple. 
 My most recent project in Gando,is a high school project.,I would like to share with you this.,The innovation in this project,is to cast mud like you cast concrete.,How do you cast mud?,We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,,and when everything is ready,,when you know what is the best recipe,and the best form,,you start working with the community.,And sometimes I can leave.,They will do it themselves.,I came to speak to you like that. 
 Another factor in Gando is rain.,When the rains come,,we hurry up to protect our fragile walls,against the rain.,Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.,It is simply how we protect our walls.,(Laughter),The rain in Burkina comes very fast,,and after that, you have floods,everywhere in the country.,But for us, the rain is good.,It brings sand and gravel to the river,we need to use to build.,We just wait for the rain to go.,We take the sand, we mix it with clay,,and we keep building.,That is it. 
 The Gando project was alwaysnconnected to training the people,,because I just wanted, one day,when I fall down and die,,that at least one person from Gando,keeps doing this work.,But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.,(Laughter) 
 And my people now can use their skills,to earn money themselves.,Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,,you have to leave the country,to the city, sometimes leave the country,and some never come back,,making the community weaker.,But now they can stay in the country,and work on different building sites,and earn money to feed their family.,There's a new quality in this work. 
 Yes, you know it.,I have won a lot of awards through this work.,For sure, it has opened opportunities.,I have become myself known.,But the reason why I do what I do,is my community. 
 When I was a kid,,I was going to school,,I was coming back every holiday to Gando.,By the end of every holidays,,I had to say goodbye to the community,,going from one compound to another one.,All women in Gando will open their clothes like that,and give me the last penny.,In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.,As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.,I just asked my mother one day,,"Why do all these women love me so much?",(Laughter),She just answered,,"They are contributing to pay for your education,hoping that you will be successful,and one day come back and help,improve the quality of life of the community.",I hope now that I was ablento make my community proud,through this work,,and I hope I was able to prove you the power,of community,,and to show you that architecture,can be inspiring for communities,to shape their own future. 
 Merci beaucoup. (Applause),Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)Mobility in developing world cities,is a very peculiar challenge,,because different from health,or education or housing,,it tends to get worse as societies become richer.,Clearly, a unsustainable model.,Mobility, as most other developing country problems,,more than a matter of money or technology,,is a matter of equality, equity.,The great inequality in developing countries,makes it difficult to see, for example,,that in terms of transport,,an advanced city is not one,where even the poor use cars,,but rather one where even the rich,use public transport.,Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,,more than 30 percent of the population,uses bicycles,,despite the fact that the Netherlands has,a higher income per capita than the United States.,There is a conflict in developing world cities,for money, for government investment.,If more money is invested in highways,,of course there is less money for housing,,for schools, for hospitals,,and also there is a conflict for space.,There is a conflict for space between,those with cars and those without them.,Most of us accept today,that private property and a market economy,is the best way to managenmost of society's resources.,However, there is a problem with that,,that market economy needs,inequality of income in order to work.,Some people must make more money,,some others less.,Some companies succeed. Others fail.,Then what kind of equality,can we hope for today,with a market economy? 
 I would propose two kinds,which both have much to do with cities.,The first one is equality of quality of life,,especially for children,,that all children should have,,beyond the obvious health and education,,access to green spaces, to sports facilities,,to swimming pools, to music lessons.,And the second kind of equality,is one which we could call "democratic equality.",The first article in every constitution states,that all citizens are equal before the law.,That is not just poetry.,It's a very powerful principle.,For example, if that is true,,a bus with 80 passengers,has a right to 80 times more road space,than a car with one. 
 We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,,that it's before our noses and we do not see it.,Less than 100 years ago,,women could not vote,,and it seemed normal,,in the same way that it seems normal today,to see a bus in traffic.,In fact, when I became mayor,,applying that democratic principle,that public good prevails over private interest,,that a bus with 100 people,has a right to 100 timesnmore road space than a car,,we implemented a mass transit system,based on buses in exclusive lanes.,We called it TransMilenio,nin order to make buses sexier.,And one thing is that it is also a very beautifulndemocratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,,expensive cars stuck in traffic,,it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.,In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.,It doesn't take Ph.D.'s.,A committee of 12-year-old children,would find out in 20 minutes,that the most efficient way to use scarce road space,is with exclusive lanes for buses.,In fact, buses are not sexy,,but they are the only possible means,to bring mass transit to all areas,of fast growing developing cities.,They also have great capacity.,For example, this system in Guangzhou,is moving more passengers our direction,than all subway lines in China,,except for one line in Beijing,,at a fraction of the cost. 
 We fought not just for space for buses,,but we fought for space for people,,and that was even more difficult.,Cities are human habitats,,and we humans are pedestrians.,Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly,or deer need to run, we need to walk.,There is a really enormous conflict,,when we are talking about developing country cities,,between pedestrians and cars.,Here, what you see is a picture that shows,insufficient democracy.,What this shows is that people who walk,are third-class citizens,while those who go in cars,are first-class citizens.,In terms of transport infrastructure,,what really makes a difference,between advanced and backward cities,is not highways or subways,but quality sidewalks.,Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,,and they forgot to make a sidewalk.,This is prevailing all over the world.,Not even schoolchildrennare more important than cars. 
 In my city of Bogotá,,we fought a very difficult battle,in order to take space from cars,,which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,,in order to make space for people that should reflect,dignity of human beings,,and to make space for protected bikeways.,First of all, I had black hair before that.,(Laughter),And I was almost impeached in the process.,It is a very difficult battle.,However, it was possible, finally,,after very difficult battles, to make a city,that would reflect some respect for human dignity,,that would show that those who walk are equally,important to those who have cars.,Indeed, a very important ideologicalnand political issue anywhere,is how to distribute that most valuable resource,of a city, which is road space.,A city could find oil or diamonds underground,and it would not be so valuable as road space.,How to distribute it between pedestrians,,bicycles, public transport and cars?,This is not a technological issue,,and we should remember that in no constitution,parking is a constitutional right,when we make that distribution. 
 We also built, and this was 15 years ago,,before there were bikeways in New York,or in Paris or in London,,it was a very difficult battle as well,,more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.,I don't think protected bicycle ways,are a cute architectural feature.,They are a right, just as sidewalks are,,unless we believe that only those,with access to a motor vehicle,have a right to safe mobility,,without the risk of getting killed.,And just as busways are,,protected bikeways also are,a powerful symbol of democracy,,because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle,is equally important,to one in a $30,000 car. 
 And we are living in a unique moment in history.,In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities,which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.,In many developing country cities,,more than 80 and 90 percent,of the city which will exist in 2060,will be built over the next four or five decades. 
 But this is not just a matternfor developing country cities.,In the United States, for example,,more than 70 million new homes,must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.,That's more than all the homes that today exist,in Britain, France and Canada put together.,And I believe that our cities today,have severe flaws,,and that different, better ones could be built. 
 What is wrong with our cities today?,Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child,who is barely learning to speak,in any city in the world today,,"Watch out, a car,",the child will jump in fright,,and with a very good reason, because there are,more than 10,000 children who are killed,by cars every year in the world.,We have had cities for 8,000 years,,and children could walk out of home and play.,In fact, only very recently,,towards 1900, there were no cars.,Cars have been here for reallynless than 100 years.,They completely changed cities.,In 1900, for example,,nobody was killed by cars in the United States.,Only 20 years later,,between 1920 and 1930,,almost 200,000 people,were killed by cars in the United States.,Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children,were killed by cars in the United States.,So we could make different cities,,cities that will give more priority to human beings,than to cars, that will give more public space,to human beings than to cars,,cities which show great respect,for those most vulnerable citizens,,such as children or the elderly. 
 I will propose to you a couple of ingredients,which I think would make cities much better,,and it would be very simple to implement them,in the new cities which are only being created.,Hundreds of kilometers of greenways,criss-crossing cities in all directions.,Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.,They could go for dozens of kilometers safely,without any risk in wonderful greenways,,sort of bicycle highways,,and I would invite you to imagine the following:,a city in which every other street would be,a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.,In new cities which are going to be built,,this would not be particularly difficult.,When I was mayor of Bogotá,,in only three years, we were able to create,70 kilometers,,in one of the most dense cities in the world,,of these bicycle highways.,And this changes the way people live,,move, enjoy the city.,In this picture, you see in onenof the very poor neighborhoods,,we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,,and the cars still in the mud.,Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.,But what do we do first?,Ninety-nine percent of the peoplenin those neighborhoods don't have cars.,But you see, when a city is only being created,,it's very easy to incorporate,this kind of infrastructure.,Then the city grows around it.,And of course this is just a glimpse,of something which could be much better,if we just create it,,and it changes the way of life. 
 And the second ingredient,nwhich would solve mobility,,that very difficult challenge in developing countries,,in a very low-cost and simple way,,would be to have hundreds of kilometers,of streets only for buses,,buses and bicycles and pedestrians.,This would be, again, a very low-cost solution,if implemented from the start,,low cost, pleasant transit,with natural sunlight. 
 But unfortunately, reality is not as good,as my dreams.,Because of private property of land,and high land prices,,all developing country citiesnhave a large problem of slums.,In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes,in cities initially were illegal developments.,And of course it's very difficult to have,mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.,But even legal developments,have also been located in the wrong places,,very far from the city centers,where it's impossible to provide,low-cost, high-frequency public transport.,As a Latin American, and Latin America,was the most recently organized region in the world,,I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,,to those countries which are yet to urbanize --,Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950,to 80 percent urban in 2010 --,I would recommend Asian and African countries,which are yet to urbanize,,such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,,that governments should acquirenall land around cities.,In this way, their cities could grow in the right places,with the right spaces, with the parks,,with the greenways, with the busways. 
 The cities we are going to build,over the next 50 years,will determine quality of life and even happiness,for billions of people towards the future.,What a fantastic opportunity for leaders,and many young leaders to come,,especially in the developing countries.,They can create a much happier life,for billions towards the future.,I am sure, I am optimistic,,that they will make cities better,than our most ambitious dreams. 
 (Applause)I'm a teacher and a practitioner,of civics in America.,Now, I will kindly ask those ofnyou who have just fallen asleep,to please wake up. (Laughter),Why is it that the very word "civics",has such a soporific, neven a narcoleptic effect,on us?,I think it's because the very nword signifies something,exceedingly virtuous, nexceedingly important,,and exceedingly boring.,Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,,people who show up for gatherings like this,in person or online, in any way we can,,to make civics sexy again,,as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,,as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.,And I believe the way we make civics sexy again,is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.,The way we do that, I believe,,is at the level of the city. 
 This is what I want to talk about today,,and I want to start by defining some terms,and then I want to describe the scale,of the problem I think we face,and then suggest the ways that I believe cities,can be the seat of the solution.,So let me start with some definitions.,By civics, I simply mean the art,of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor,in a self-governing community.,Civics is the art of citizenship,,what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply,showing up for life,,and it encompasses three things:,a foundation of values,,an understanding of the systemsnthat make the world go round,,and a set of skills,that allow you to pursue goals,and to have others join in that pursuit. 
 And that brings me to my definition of power,,which is simply this:,the capacity to make others do,what you would have them do.,It sounds menacing, doesn't it?,We don't like to talk about power.,We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.,We feel uncomfortable naming it.,In the culture and mythology of democracy,,power resides with the people.,Period. End of story.,Any further inquiry not necessary,and not really that welcome.,Power has a negative moral valence.,It sounds Machiavellian inherently.,It seems inherently evil.,But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil,than fire or physics.,It just is.,And power governs,how any form of government operates,,whether a democracy or a dictatorship.,And the problem we face today,nhere in America in particular,,but all around the world,,is that far too many people nare profoundly illiterate,in power —,what it is, who has it,,how it operates, how it flows,,what part of it is visible, nwhat part of it is not,,why some people have it, nwhy that's compounded.,And as a result of this illiteracy,,those few who do understand,how power operates in civic life,,those who understand,how a bill becomes a law, yes,,but also how a friendship nbecomes a subsidy,,or how a bias becomes a policy,,or how a slogan becomes a movement,,the people who understand those things,wield disproportionate influence,,and they're perfectly happy,to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance,of the great majority. 
 This is why it is so fundamental for us right now,to grab hold of this idea of power,and to democratize it.,One of the things that is so profoundly exciting,and challenging about this moment,is that as a result of this power illiteracy,that is so pervasive,,there is a concentration,of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.,I mean, think about it:,How does a friendship become a subsidy?,Seamlessly,,when a senior government official decides,to leave government and become a lobbyist,for a private interest,and convert his or her relationships into capital,for their new masters.,How does a bias become a policy?,Insidiously, just the way that,stop-and-frisk, for instance,,became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.,How does a slogan become a movement?,Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,,was able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag,from the American Revolution,,or how, on the other side,,a band of activists could take a magazine headline,,"Occupy Wall Street,",and turn that into a global meme and movement.,The thing is, though, most people,aren't looking for and don'tnwant to see these realities.,So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,,is willful.,There are some millennials, for instance,,who think the whole business is just sordid.,They don't want to have anything to do with politics.,They'd rather just opt out,and engage in volunteerism.,There are some techies out there,who believe that the cure-all,for any power imbalance or power abuse,is simply more data,,more transparency.,There are some on the left who think power resides,only with corporations,,and some on the right who think power,resides only with government,,each side blinded by their selective outrage.,There are the naive who believe that,good things just happen,and the cynical who believenthat bad things just happen,,the fortunate and unfortunate alike,who think that their lot is simply what they deserve,rather than the eminently alterable result,of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,,of power. 
 As a result of all of thisncreeping fatalism in public life,,we here, particularly in America today,,have depressingly low levels,of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,,awareness.,The whole business of politics has been,effectively subcontracted outnto a band of professionals,,money people, outreach people,,message people, research people.,The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs,in the sense of suckers.,We become demotivated to learn more,about how things work.,We begin to opt out. 
 Well, this problem, this challenge,,is a thing that we must now confront,,and I believe that when you have,this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,,it becomes both a cause and a consequence,of this concentration of opportunity,of wealth and clout that I wasndescribing a moment ago,,this profound civic inequality.,This is why it is so important in our time right now,to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.,Perhaps it's never been more important,at any time in our lifetimes.,If people don't learn power,,people don't wake up,,and if they don't wake up,,they get left out. 
 Now, part of the art of practicing power,means being awake and having a voice,,but it also is about having an arena,where you can plausibly practice deciding.,All of civics boils down to the simple question,of who decides,,and you have to play that out,in a place, in an arena. 
 And this brings me to the thirdnpoint that I want to make today,,which is simply that there is no better arena,in our time for the practicing of power,than the city.,Think about the city where you live,,where you're from.,Think about a problem innthe common life of your city.,It can be something small,,like where a street lamp should go,,or something medium like,which library should have its hours extended or cut,,or maybe something bigger,,like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be,turned into a highway or a greenway,,or whether all the businesses in your town,should be required to pay a living wage.,Think about the change that you want in your city,,and then think about how you would get it,,how you would make it happen.,Take an inventory of all the forms of power,that are at play in your city's situation:,money, of course, people, yes,,ideas, information, misinformation,,the threat of force, the force of norms.,All of these form of power are at play.,Now think about how you would activate,or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power. 
 This is not some Game of Thrones,empire-level set of questions.,These are questions that play out,in every single place on the planet.,I'll just tell you quickly about two stories,drawn from recent headlines.,In Boulder, Colorado,,voters not too long ago approved a process,to replace the private power company,,literally the power company,nthe electric company Xcel,,with a publicly owned utility,that would forego profits,and attend far more to climate change.,Well, Xcel fought back,,and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure,that would undermine or undo,this municipalization.,And so the citizen activists innBoulder who have been pushing this,now literally have to fight the power,in order to fight for power.,In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,,there's an organization on campus,called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,,and it draws from largely white sororities,and fraternities on campus,,and for decades, the Machine has dominated,student government elections.,Well now, recently, the Machine,has started to get involved,in actual city politics,,and they've engineered the election,of a former Machine member,,a young, pro-business recent graduate,to the Tuscaloosa city school board.,Now, as I say, these are just two examples,drawn almost at random from the headlines.,Every day, there are thousands more like them.,And you may like or dislike,the efforts I'm describing here,in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,,but you cannot help but admire,the power literacy of the players involved,,their skill.,You cannot help but reckon with and recognize,the command they have,of the elemental questions,of civic power —,what objective, what strategy, what tactics,,what is the terrain, who are your enemies,,who are your allies? 
 Now I want you to return,to thinking about that problem or that opportunity,or that challenge in your city,,and the thing it was that you want to fix,or create in your city,,and ask yourself,,do you have command of thesenelemental questions of power?,Could you put into practice effectively,what it is that you know?,This is the challenge and the opportunity for us. 
 We live in a time right now,where in spite of globalization,or perhaps because of globalization,,all citizenship is ever more resonantly,,powerfully local.,Indeed, power in our time is flowing,ever faster to the city.,Here in the United States, the national government,has tied itself up in partisan knots.,Civic imagination and innovation and creativity,are emerging from local ecosystems now,and radiating outward,,and this great innovation,,this great wave,of localism that's now arriving,,and you see it in how people eat,and work and share and buy and move,and live their everyday lives,,this isn't some precious parochialism,,this isn't some retreat into insularity, no.,This is emergent.,The localism of our time is networked powerfully.,And so, for instance,,consider the ways that strategies,for making cities more bike-friendly,have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen,to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.,Think about how experimentsnin participatory budgeting,,where everyday citizens get a chance,to allocate and decide upon,the allocation of city funds.,Those experiments havenspread from Porto Alegre, Brazil,to here in New York City, nto the wards of Chicago.,Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles,and many cities between,are now organizing to stage strikes,to remind the people who live in their cities,what a day without immigrants would look like.,In China, all across that country,,members of the New Citizens' Movement,are beginning to activate and organize,to fight official corruption and graft,,and they're drawing the ire of officials there,,but they're also drawing the attention,of anti-corruption activists all around the world.,In Seattle, where I'm from,,we've become part of a great global array of cities,that are now working together,bypassing government altogether,,national government altogether,,in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals,of the Kyoto Protocol.,All of these citizens, united,,are forming a web,,a great archipelago of power,that allows us to bypass,brokenness and monopolies of control. 
 And our task now is to accelerate this work.,Our task now is to bring more and more people,into the fold of this work.,That's why my organization, Citizen University,,has undertaken a project now,to create an everyman's curriculum,in civic power.,And this curriculum starts with this triad,that I described earlier of values,,systems and skills.,And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you,to help create this curriculum,with the stories and the experiences,and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,,to create something powerfully collective.,And I want to invite you in particular to try,a simple exercise drawn,from the early frameworks of this curriculum.,I want you to write a narrative,,a narrative from the future of your city,,and you can date it, set it out one year from now,,five years from now, a decade from now,,a generation from now,,and write it as a case study looking back,,looking back at the change,that you wanted in your city,,looking back at the causenthat you were championing,,and describing the ways that that change,and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.,Describe the values,of your fellow citizens that you activated,,and the sense of moral purposenthat you were able to stir.,Recount all the different ways,that you engaged the systems of government,,of the marketplace,,of social institutions, of faith organizations,,of the media.,Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,,how to negotiate, how to advocate,,how to frame issues,,how to navigate diversity in conflict,,all those skills that enabled you,to bring folks on board,and to overcome resistance.,What you'll be doing when you write that narrative,is you'll be discovering how to read power,,and in the process, how to write power.,So share what you write,,do you what you write,,and then share what you do.,I invite you to literally share,the narratives that you create,on our Facebook page for Citizen University.,But even beyond that, it's in the conversations,that we have today,all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings,that are happening on this topic at this moment,,and to think about how we can become,one another's teachers and students in power.,If we do that, then together,we can make civics sexy again.,Together, we can democratize democracy,and make it safe again for amateurs.,Together, we can create a great network of city,that will be the most powerful collective laboratory,for self-government this planet has ever seen.,We have the power to do that. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The work of a transportation commissioner,isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.,It involves the design of cities,and the design of city streets.,Streets are some of the most valuable resources,that a city has, and yet it's an asset,that's largely hidden in plain sight.,And the lesson from New York,over the past six years,is that you can update this asset.,You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,,it can provide immediate benefits,,and it can be quite popular.,You just need to look at them a little differently. 
 This is important because we live in an urban age.,For the first time in history,,most people live in cities,,and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,,the population is going to double on the planet.,So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.,Mayor Bloomberg recognized this,when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.,The plan recognized that cities,are in a global marketplace,,and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive,and to attract the million more people,that are expected to move here,,we need to focus on the quality of life,and the efficiency of our infrastructure. 
 For many cities, our streets have been,in a kind of suspended animation for generations.,This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,,and despite all of the technological innovation,,cultural changes, political changes,,this is Times Square in 2008.,Not much has changed in those 50 years.,So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,,to maximize efficient mobility,,providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,,more room for people to enjoy the city,,and to make our streets as safe as they can be,for everybody that uses them. 
 We set out a clear action plan,with goals and benchmarks.,Having goals is important,,because if you want to change and steer the ship,of a big city in a new direction,,you need to know where you're going and why. 
 The design of a street can tell you everything,about what's expected on it.,In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.,The design of this street is really,to maximize the movement of cars,moving as quickly as possible,from point A to point B,,and it misses all the other ways,that a street is used. 
 When we started out, we did some early surveys,about how our streets were used,,and we found that New York City was largely,a city without seats.,Pictures like this, people perched,on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.,(Laughter),It's not great for parents with kids.,It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.,It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.,Certainly not good for the police department. 
 So we worked hard to change that balance,,and probably the best example of our new approach,is in Times Square.,Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day,walk through Times Square,,and people had tried for years to make changes.,They changed signals, they changed lanes,,everything they could do to make Times Square work better.,It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.,It was chaotic.,And so, none of those approaches worked,,so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,,looked at our street differently.,And so we did a six-month pilot.,We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street,and created two and a half acres,of new pedestrian space.,And the temporary materials are an important part,of the program, because we were able to show,how it worked.,And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.,So it was all about the data.,So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,,if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,,and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,,we could put it back the way that it was,,because these were temporary materials.,And that was a very big part of the buy-in,,much less anxiety when you think that something,can be put back.,But the results were overwhelming.,Traffic moved better. It was much safer.,Five new flagship stores opened.,It's been a total home run.,Times Square is now one of the top 10,retail locations on the planet.,And this is an important lesson,,because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game,between moving traffic and creating public space. 
 Every project has its surprises,,and one of the big surprises with Times Square,was how quickly people flocked to the space.,We put out the orange barrels,,and people just materialized immediately into the street.,It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?,They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!,All the people arrived.,Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.,And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,,because the street furniture had not yet arrived.,So we went to a hardware store,and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,,and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.,And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.,It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.,It was about those lawn chairs.,"What did you think about the lawn chairs?","Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?",So if you've got a big, controversial project,,think about lawn chairs.,(Laughter) 
 This is the final design for Times Square,,and it will create a level surface,,sidewalk to sidewalk,,beautiful pavers that have studs in them,to reflect the light from the billboards,,creating a great new energy on the street,,and we think it's going to really create,a great place, a new crossroads of the world,that is worthy of its name.,And we will be cutting the ribbon on this,,the first phase, this December. 
 With all of our projects, our public space projects,,we work closely with local businesses,and local merchant groups,who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,,take care of the plants.,This is in front of Macy's, and they were,a big supporter of this new approach,,because they understood that more people on foot,is better for business. 
 And we've done these projects all across the city,in all kinds of neighborhoods.,This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,,and you can see the short leg that was there,,used for cars, that's not really needed.,So what we did is we painted over the street,,put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle,to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,,created a great new public space,,and it's been great for businesses,along Grand Avenue.,We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,,and this is one of our first projects that we did,,and we took an underutilized,,pretty dingy-looking parking lot,and used some paint and planters,to transform it over a weekend.,And in the three years since we've implemented the project,,retail sales have increased 172 percent.,And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood. 
 We've moved very, very quickly,with paint and temporary materials.,Instead of waiting,through years of planning studies,and computer models to get something done,,we've done it with paint and temporary materials.,And the proof is not in a computer model.,It is in the real-world performance of the street.,You can have fun with paint. 
 All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas,in all five boroughs across the city.,We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes,and turned them into new pedestrian space. 
 I think one of the successes is in its emulation.,You're seeing this kind of approach,,since we've painted Times Square,,you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,,in San Francisco, in Mexico City,,Buenos Aires, you name it.,This is actually in Los Angeles,,and they actually copied even the green dots,that we had on the streets.,But I can't underscore enough,how much more quickly this enables you to move,over traditional construction methods. 
 We also brought this quick-acting approach,to our cycling program,,and in six years turned cycling,into a real transportation option in New York.,I think it's fair to say --,(Applause) --,it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,,and now New York has become,one of the cycling capitals in the United States. 
 And we moved quickly to create an interconnected,network of lanes.,You can see the map in 2007.,This is how it looked in 2013,after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.,I love this because it looks so easy.,You just click it, and they're there.,We also brought new designs to the street.,We created the first parking-protected bike lane,in the United States. 
 (Applause) 
 We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,,and it's been great.,Bike volumes have spiked.,Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,,are all down 50 percent.,And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,,and now you're seeing them pop up,all over the country.,And you can see here that this strategy has worked.,The blue line is the number of cyclists,,soaring.,The green line is the number of bike lanes.,And the yellow line is the number of injuries,,which has remained essentially flat.,After this big expansion, you've seen,no net increase in injuries,,and so there is something to that axiom,that there is safety in numbers. 
 Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,,and there was a lawsuit and somewhat,of a media frenzy a couple years ago.,One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane,that we have on Prospect Park West,"the most contested piece of land,outside of the Gaza Strip." 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is what we had done.,So if you dig below the headlines, though,,you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,,far ahead of the politicians.,In fact, I think most politicians would be happy,to have those kind of poll numbers.,Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes. 
 This summer, we launched Citi Bike,,the largest bike share program in the United States,,with 6,000 bikes,and 330 stations located next to one another.,Since we've launched the program,,three million trips have been taken.,People have ridden seven million miles.,That's 280 times around the globe.,And so with this little blue key,,you can unlock the keys to the city,and this brand new transportation option. 
 And daily usage just continues to soar.,What has happened is the average daily ridership,on the streets of New York is 36,000 people.,The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.,Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.,The bikes are being used six times a day.,And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders,that are on the streets.,In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,,ninja-clad bike messenger.,And today, cyclists look,like New York City looks.,It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,,women, kids, all getting on a bike.,It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.,Quite radical. 
 We've also brought this approach to our buses,,and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,,the slowest bus speeds.,As everybody knows,,you can walk across town faster,than you can take the bus.,And so we focused on the most congested areas,of New York City,,built out six bus rapid transit lines,,57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.,You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.,We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out,because they get ticketed by a camera,if they use that lane,,and it's been a huge success. 
 I think one of my very favorite moments,as transportation commissioner was the day,that we launched Citi Bike,,and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue,in my protected bike lane,,and I looked over and I saw pedestrians,standing safely on the pedestrian islands,,and the traffic was flowing,,birds were singing --,(Laughter) --,the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.,It was just fantastic. 
 And this is how it looked six years ago. 
 And so, I think that the lesson that we have,from New York is that it's possible,to change your streets quickly,,it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,,and it can be quite popular.,You just need to reimagine your streets.,They're hidden in plain sight. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,,former arts advocate,,trained in architecture and art history,,and I want to talk to you today not about design,but about America,and how America can be more economically resilient,,how America can be healthier,,and how America can be,more environmentally sustainable.,And I realize this is a global forum,,but I think I need to talk about America,because there is a history,,in some places, not all,,of American ideas being appropriated,,being emulated, for better or for worse,,around the world. 
 And the worst idea we've ever had,is suburban sprawl.,It's being emulated in many places as we speak.,By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization,of the landscape and the creation of the landscape,around the requirement of automobile use,,and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom,has become a gas-belching,,time-wasting and life-threatening,prosthetic device,that many of us need just to,,most Americans, in fact, need,,just to live their daily lives.,And there's an alternative.,You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.,Well, in America, that living in cities,,for many of them, they're living in cities still,where they're dependent on that automobile.,And what I work for, and to do,,is to make our cities more walkable.,But I can't give design arguments for that,that will have as much impact,as the arguments that I've learned,from the economists, the epidemiologists,and the environmentalists.,So these are the three arguments that I'm going,to give you quickly today. 
 When I was growing up in the '70s,,the typical American spent one tenth of their income,,American family, on transportation.,Since then, we've doubled the number of roads,in America, and we now spend one fifth,of our income on transportation.,Working families, which are defined as,earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars,a year in America,are spending more now on transportation,than on housing, slightly more,,because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,",finding homes further and further and further,from the city centers and from their jobs,,so that they're locked in this, two, three hours,,four hours a day of commuting.,And these are the neighborhoods, for example,,in the Central Valley of California,that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst,and when the price of gas went up;,they were decimated.,And in fact, these are many,of the half-vacant communities that you see today.,Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,,it goes underwater, and you have to pay,twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. 
 So we know what it's done to our society,and all the extra work we have to do,to support our cars.,What happens when a city decides,it's going to set other priorities?,And probably the best example we have here,in America is Portland, Oregon.,Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s,that began to distinguish it,from almost every other American city.,While most other cities were growing,an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,,they instituted an urban growth boundary.,While most cities were reaming out their roads,,removing parallel parking and trees,in order to flow more traffic,,they instituted a skinny streets program.,And while most cities were investing in more roads,and more highways, they actually invested,in bicycling and in walking.,And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,,which seems like a lot of money,,but it was spent over about 30 years,,so two million dollars a year -- not that much --,and half the price of the one cloverleaf,that they decided to rebuild in that city.,These changes and others like them changed,the way that Portlanders live,,and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,,the amount that each person drives,,actually peaked in 1996,,has been dropping ever since,,and they now drive 20 percent less,than the rest of the country.,The typical Portland citizen drives,four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day,than they did before.,The economist Joe Cortright did the math,and he found out that those four miles,plus those 11 minutes,adds up to fully three and a half percent,of all income earned in the region. 
 So if they're not spending that money on driving --,and by the way, 85 percent of the money,we spend on driving leaves the local economy --,if they're not spending that money on driving,,what are they spending it on?,Well, Portland is reputed to have,the most roof racks per capita,,the most independent bookstores per capita,,the most strip clubs per capita.,These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations,of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders,spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds,than the rest of America.,Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol,than most other states,,which may be a good thing or a bad thing,,but it makes you glad they're driving less. 
 (Laughter) 
 But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,,and home investment is about as local,an investment as you can get.,But there's a whole other Portland story,,which isn't part of this calculus,,which is that young, educated people,have been moving to Portland in droves,,so that between the last two censuses,,they had a 50-percent increase,in college-educated millennials,,which is five times what you saw anywhere else,in the country, or, I should say, of the national average. 
 So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents,by being more walkable and more bikeable,,but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city,that people want to be in these days.,So the best economic strategy,you can have as a city,is not the old way of trying to attract corporations,and trying to have a biotech cluster,or a medical cluster,,or an aerospace cluster,,but to become a place where people want to be.,And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,,64 percent of whom decide first,where they want to live,,then they move there, then they look for a job,,they will come to your city. 
 The health argument is a scary one,,and you've probably heard part of this argument before.,Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,,back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.,Now one out of three Americans is obese,,and a second third of the population is overweight.,Twenty-five percent of young men,and 40 percent of young women are too heavy,to enlist in our own military forces.,According to the Center for Disease Control,,fully one third of all children born after 2000,will get diabetes.,We have the first generation of children in America,who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. 
 I believe that this American healthcare crisis,that we've all heard about,is an urban design crisis,,and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.,Because we've talked a long time about diet,,and we know that diet impacts weight,,and weight of course impacts health.,But we've only started talking about inactivity,,and how inactivity born of our landscape,,inactivity that comes from the fact that we live,in a place where there is no longer any such thing,as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.,And we finally have the studies,,one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth",that tracked weight against diet,and tracked weight against inactivity,,and found a much higher, stronger correlation,between the latter two.,Dr. James Levine at, in this case,,the aptly-named Mayo Clinic,put his test subjects in electronic underwear,,held their diet steady,,and then started pumping the calories in.,Some people gained weight,,some people didn't gain weight.,Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,,they were shocked to learn that the only difference,between the subjects that they could figure out,was the amount they were moving,,and that in fact those who gained weight,were sitting, on average, two hours more per day,than those who didn't. 
 So we have these studies that tie,weight to inactivity, but even more,,we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.,Do you live in a more walkable city,or do you live in a less walkable city,,or where in your city do you live?,In San Diego, they used Walk Score --,Walk Score rates every address in America,and soon the world,in terms of how walkable it is --,they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods,and less walkable neighborhoods.,Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,,you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.,If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,,you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.,So we have study after study now,that's tying where you live,to your health, particularly as in America,,the biggest health crisis we have is this one,that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.,And I learned a new word last week.,They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric.",I may have that wrong, but you get the idea. 
 Now that's one thing, of course.,Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic,in this country.,You probably haven't thought that much about it.,Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,,three times what it was in the '90s,,and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.,American pollution does not come,from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,,and the amount that people are driving in your city,,your urban VMT, is a good prediction,of the asthma problems in your city. 
 And then finally, in terms of driving,,there's the issue of the single-largest killer,of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers,of all people, is car crashes.,And we take car crashes for granted.,We figure it's a natural risk,of being on the road.,But in fact, here in America, 12 people,out of every 100,000,die every year from car crashes.,We're pretty safe here.,Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.,It's Japan, it's four per 100,000.,Do you know where it's three per 100,000?,New York City.,San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.,Oh, so cities make us safer,because we're driving less?,Tulsa: 14 per 100,000.,Orlando: 20 per 100,000.,It's not whether you're in the city or not,,it's how is your city designed?,Was it designed around cars or around people?,Because if your city is designed around cars,,it's really good at smashing them into each other. 
 That's part of a much larger health argument. 
 Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,,because the environmentalists turned on a dime,about 10 years ago.,The environmental movement in America,has historically been an anti-city movement,from Jefferson on. 
 "Cities are pestilential to the health,,to the liberties, to the morals of man.,If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,,as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt,as they are in Europe,and take to eating one another as they do there." 
 He apparently had a sense of humor. 
 And then the American environmental movement,has been a classically Arcadian movement.,To become more environmental, we move into the country,,we commune with nature, we build suburbs.,But, of course, we've seen what that does. 
 The carbon mapping of America,,where is the CO2 being emitted,,for many years only,hammered this argument in more strongly.,If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,,any carbon map of the U.S.,,it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,,hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,,dark, peaceful in the countryside.,Until some economists said, you know,,is that the right way to measure CO2?,There are only so many people in this country at any given time,,and we can choose to live where perhaps,we would have a lighter impact.,And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,,and when they did that, the maps just flipped,,coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,,and red hot in these exurban,"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.,So a fundamental shift, and now you have,environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser,saying we are a destructive species.,If you love nature, the best thing you can do,is stay the heck away from it,,move to a city, and the denser the better,,and the denser cities like Manhattan,are the cities that perform the best.,So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline,at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,,consuming half of the electricity of Dallas.,But of course, we can do better.,Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.,European cities consume half as much again.,So obviously, we can do better,,and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green. 
 My final argument in this topic is that,I think we're trying to be green the wrong way,,and I'm one of many people who believes that,this focus on gadgets,,on accessorizing --,What can I add to my house,,what can I add to what I've already got,to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --,has kind of dominated the discussion.,So I'm not immune to this.,My wife and I built a new house,on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,,and we did our best to clear the shelves,of the sustainability store.,We've got the solar photovoltaic system,,solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,,bamboo floors.,A log burning in my German high-tech stove,apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon,to the atmosphere than were it left alone,to decompose in the forest.,Yet all of these innovations --,That's what they said in the brochure.,(Laughter),All of these innovations together,contribute a fraction of what we contribute,by living in a walkable neighborhood,three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.,We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,,and you should do the same thing,,but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers,saves as much energy in a year,as moving to a walkable city does in a week. 
 And we don't want to have this argument.,Politicians and marketers are afraid,of marketing green as a "lifestyle choice.",You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,,that they have to change their lifestyle.,But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life,and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,,something that would be better than what we have right now? 
 Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,,it's called the Mercer Survey.,You may have heard of it.,They rank hundreds of nations worldwide,according to 10 criteria that they believe add up,to quality of life: health, economics, education,,housing, you name it.,There's six more. Short talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's very interesting to see that,the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,,number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects,of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.,The driving cities in the Sun Belt,,the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,,these cities are not appearing on the list.,But who's doing even better?,The Canadian cities like Vancouver,,where again, they're burning half the fuel.,And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,,like Dusseldorf or Vienna,,where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.,And you see this alignment, this strange alignment. 
 Is being more sustainble,what gives you a higher quality of life?,I would argue the same thing,that makes you more sustainble,is what gives you a higher quality of life,,and that's living in a walkable neighborhood.,So sustainability, which includes our wealth,and our health,may not be a direct function of our sustainability.,But particularly here in America,,we are polluting so much,because we're throwing away our time,and our money and our lives on the highway,,then these two problems would seem to share,the same solution, which is to make our cities,more walkable. 
 Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done,,it has been done,,and it's being done now in more than a few cities,,around the globe and in our country.,I take some solace from Winston Churchill,,who put it this way:,"The Americans can be counted on,to do the right thing,once they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to talk to you about a story,about a small town kid.,I don't know his name, but I do know his story.,He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.,His village is near Mogadishu.,Drought drives the small village into poverty,and to the brink of starvation.,With nothing left for him there,,he leaves for the big city,,in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.,When he arrives, there are no opportunities,,no jobs, no way forward.,He ends up living in a tent city,on the outskirts of Mogadishu.,Maybe a year passes, nothing.,One day, he's approached by a gentleman,who offers to take him to lunch,,then to dinner, to breakfast.,He meets this dynamic group of people,,and they give him a break.,He's given a bit of money,to buy himself some new clothes,,money to send back home to his family.,He is introduced to this young woman.,He eventually gets married.,He starts this new life.,He has a purpose in life. 
 One beautiful day in Mogadishu,,under an azure blue sky,,a car bomb goes off.,That small town kid with the big city dreams,was the suicide bomber,,and that dynamic group of people,were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization,linked to al Qaeda. 
 So how does the story of a small town kid,just trying to make it big in the city,end up with him blowing himself up?,He was waiting.,He was waiting for an opportunity,,waiting to begin his future,,waiting for a way forward,,and this was the first thing that came along.,This was the first thing that pulled him out,of what we call waithood. 
 And his story repeats itself,in urban centers around the world.,It is the story of the disenfranchised,,unemployed urban youth,who sparks riots in Johannesburg,,sparks riots in London,,who reaches out for something other than waithood.,For young people, the promise of the city,,the big city dream is that of opportunity,,of jobs, of wealth,,but young people are not sharingnin the prosperity of their cities.,Often it's youth who suffer fromnthe highest unemployment rates.,By 2030, three out of five people living in cities,will be under the age of 18.,If we do not include young people,in the growth of our cities,,if we do not provide them opportunities,,the story of waithood,,the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,,will be the story of cities 2.0.,And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,,70 percent of young peoplensuffer from unemployment.,70 percent don't work,,don't go to school.,They pretty much do nothing. 
 I went back to Mogadishu last month,,and I went to visit Madina Hospital,,the hospital I was born in.,I remember standing in front of that,bullet-ridden hospital thinking,,what if I had never left?,What if I had been forced,into that same state of waithood?,Would I have become a terrorist?,I'm not really sure about the answer. 
 My reason for being in Mogadishu that month,was actually to host,a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.,I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.,We sat down and brainstormed on solutions,to the biggest challenges facing their city. 
 One of the young men in the room was Aden.,He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.,There were no jobs, no opportunities.,I remember him telling me,,because he was a college graduate,,unemployed, frustrated,,that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab,and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.,They sought people like him out. 
 But his story takes a different route.,In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier,to getting from point A to point B are the roads.,Twenty-three years of civil war,have completely destroyed the road system,,and a motorbike can be the easiest way,to get around.,Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.,He started a motorbike company.,He began renting out motorbikes,to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.,He bought 10 bikes, with the help,of family and friends,,and his dream is to eventually expand,to several hundred within the next three years. 
 How is this story different?,What makes his story different?,I believe it is his ability to identify,and seize a new opportunity.,It's entrepreneurship,,and I believe entrepreneurship can be,the most powerful tool against waithood.,It empowers young people,to be the creators of the very economic opportunities,they are so desperately seeking. 
 And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.,I want to talk to you about a young man,who attended one of my meetings,,Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.,He was helping me train some of the young people,at the summit in entrepreneurship,and how to be innovative,and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.,He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen,in over 22 years,,and until recently, until Mohamed came along,,if you wanted flowers at your wedding,,you used plastic bouquets,shipped from abroad.,If you asked someone,,"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?",for many who grew up under civil war,,the answer would be, "Never." 
 So Mohamed saw an opportunity.,He started a landscaping and design floral company.,He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,,and started growing tulips and lilies,,which he said could survive,the harsh Mogadishu climate.,And he began delivering flowers to weddings,,creating gardens at homes,and businesses around the city,,and he's now working on creating,Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.,There's no public park in Mogadishu.,He wants to create a space where families,,young people, can come together,,and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.,And he doesn't grow roses because,they use too much water, by the way. 
 So the first step is to inspire young people,,and in that room, Mohamed's presence,had a really profound impactnon the youth in that room.,They had never really thoughtnabout starting up a business.,They've thought about working for an NGO,,working for the government,,but his story, his innovation,,really had a strong impact on them.,He forced them to look at their city,as a place of opportunity.,He empowered them to believenthat they could be entrepreneurs,,that they could be change makers.,By the end of the day, they were coming up,with innovative solutions,to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.,They came up with entrepreneurial solutions,to local problems. 
 So inspiring young people,and creating a culture of entrepreneurship,is a really great step,,but young people need capital,to make their ideas a reality.,They need expertise and mentorship,to guide them in developingnand launching their businesses.,Connect young people with the resources they need,,provide them the support they neednto go from ideation to creation,,and you will create catalysts for urban growth. 
 For me, entrepreneurship is more than just,starting up a business.,It's about creating a social impact.,Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.,I believe he is selling hope.,His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,,when it's created, will actually transform,the way people see their city.,Aden hired street kids to help rent out,and maintain those bikes for him.,He gave them the opportunity to escape,the paralysis of waithood.,These young entrepreneurs are having,a tremendous impact in their cities. 
 So my suggestion is,,turn youth into entrepreneurs,,incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,,and you will have more storiesnof flowers and Peace Parks,than of car bombs and waithood. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was about 10 years old,on a camping trip with my dad,in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area,in the northern part of New York State.,It was a beautiful day.,The forest was sparkling.,The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,,and if it weren't for the path we were following,,we could almost pretend we were,the first human beings to ever walk that land. 
 We got to our campsite.,It was a lean-to on a bluff,looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,,when I discovered a horror.,Behind the lean-to was a dump,,maybe 40 feet square,with rotting apple cores,and balled-up aluminum foil,,and a dead sneaker.,And I was astonished,,I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.,The campers who were too lazy,to take out what they had brought in,,who did they think would clean up after them? 
 That question stayed with me,,and it simplified a little.,Who cleans up after us?,However you configure,or wherever you place the us,,who cleans up after us in Istanbul?,Who cleans up after us in Rio,or in Paris or in London?,Here in New York,,the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,,to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage,and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.,I wanted to get to know them as individuals.,I wanted to understand who takes the job.,What's it like to wear the uniform,and bear that burden? 
 So I started a research project with them.,I rode in the trucks and walked the routes,and interviewed people in offices and facilities,all over the city,,and I learned a lot,,but I was still an outsider.,I needed to go deeper. 
 So I took the job as a sanitation worker.,I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.,And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.,It was a remarkable privilege,and an amazing education. 
 Everyone asks about the smell.,It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,,and on days when it is really bad,,you get used to it rather quickly.,The weight takes a long time to get used to.,I knew people who were several years on the job,whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden,of bearing on your body,tons of trash every week. 
 Then there's the danger.,According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,,sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous,occupations in the country,,and I learned why.,You're in and out of traffic all day,,and it's zooming around you.,It just wants to get past you, so it's often,the motorist is not paying attention.,That's really bad for the worker.,And then the garbage itself is full of hazards,that often fly back out of the truck,and do terrible harm. 
 I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.,When you step off the curb,and you see a city from behind a truck,,you come to understand that trash,is like a force of nature unto itself.,It never stops coming.,It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.,It must always be in motion. 
 And then there's the stigma.,You put on the uniform, and you become invisible,until someone is upset with you for whatever reason,like you've blocked traffic with your truck,,or you're taking a break too close to their home,,or you're drinking coffee in their diner,,and they will come and scorn you,,and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.,I find the stigma especially ironic,,because I strongly believe that sanitation workers,are the most important labor force,on the streets of the city, for three reasons.,They are the first guardians of public health.,If they're not taking away trash,efficiently and effectively every day,,it starts to spill out of its containments,,and the dangers inherent to it threaten us,in very real ways.,Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries,burst forth again and start to harm us.,The economy needs them.,If we can't throw out the old stuff,,we have no room for the new stuff,,so then the engines of the economy,start to sputter when consumption is compromised.,I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.,And then there's what I call,our average, necessary quotidian velocity.,By that I simply mean,how fast we're used to moving,in the contemporary day and age.,We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around,our coffee cup, our shopping bag,,our bottle of water.,We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,,because we know there's a workforce,on the other side that's going to take it all away. 
 So I want to suggest today a couple of ways,to think about sanitation that will perhaps help,ameliorate the stigma,and bring them into this conversation,of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.,Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.,They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.,They wear a uniform in many cities.,You know when to expect them.,And their work lets us do our work.,They are almost a form of reassurance.,The flow that they maintain,keeps us safe from ourselves,,from our own dross, our cast-offs,,and that flow must be maintained always,no matter what. 
 On the day after September 11 in 2001,,I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,,and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs,and there was a man doing his paper recycling route,like he did every Wednesday.,And I tried to thank him for doing his work,on that day of all days,,but I started to cry.,And he looked at me,,and he just nodded, and he said,,"We're going to be okay.,We're going to be okay.",It was a little while later that I started,my research with sanitation,,and I met that man again.,His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,,and we became good friends. 
 I want to believe that Paulie was right.,We are going to be okay.,But in our effort to reconfigure,how we as a species exist on this planet,,we must include and take account of,all the costs, including the very real human cost,of the labor.,And we also would be well informed,to reach out to the people who do that work,and get their expertise,on how do we think about,,how do we create systems around sustainability,that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,,which is a remarkable success across 40 years,,across the United States and countries around the world,,and lift us up to a broader horizon,where we're looking at other forms of waste,that could be lessened,from manufacturing and industrial sources.,Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,,accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.,It's a remarkable statistic. 
 So in the flow of your days,,in the flow of your lives,,next time you see someone whose job is,to clean up after you,,take a moment to acknowledge them.,Take a moment to say thank you. 
 (Applause)Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough,to work with many of the great,international architects,,documenting their work and observing,how their designs have the capacity,to influence the cities in which they sit.,I think of new cities like Dubai,or ancient cities like Rome,with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,,or like right here in New York with the High Line,,a city which has been so much influenced,by the development of this. 
 But what I find really fascinating,is what happens when architects and planners leave,and these places become appropriated by people,,like here in Chandigarh, India,,the city which has been completely designed,by the architect Le Corbusier.,Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over,by people in very different ways,from whatever perhaps intended for,,like here, where you have the people,sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.,But over the course of several years,,I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's,CCTV building in Beijing,and the olympic stadium in the same city,by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.,At these large-scale construction sites in China,,you see a sort of makeshift camp,where workers live during the entire building process.,As the length of the construction takes years,,workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready,informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition,against the sophisticated structures that they're building. 
 Over the past seven years, I've been following,my fascination with the built environment,,and for those of you who know me, you would say,that this obsession has led me to live,out of a suitcase 365 days a year.,Being constantly on the move,means that sometimes I am able,to catch life's most unpredictable moments,,like here in New York,the day after the Sandy storm hit the city. 
 Just over three years ago,,I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,,and while flying over the city, I was just amazed,by the extent to which the slums,reach into every corner of the city,,a place where nearly 70 percent of the population,lives in slums,,draped literally all over the mountains.,During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,,I learned about the Torre David,,a 45-story office building which sits,right in the center of Caracas.,The building was under construction,until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy,and the death of the developer in the early '90s.,About eight years ago, people started moving,into the abandoned tower,and began to build their homes right in between,every column of this unfinished tower.,There's only one little entrance to the entire building,,and the 3,000 residents come in and out,through that single door.,Together, the inhabitants created public spaces,and designed them to feel more like a home,and less like an unfinished tower.,In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.,They also made a basketball court.,But when you look up closely,,you see massive holes where elevators,and services would have run through. 
 Within the tower, people have come up,with all sorts of solutions,in response to the various needs,which arise from living in an unfinished tower.,With no elevators,,the tower is like a 45-story walkup.,Designed in very specific ways,by this group of people,who haven't had any education in architecture or design.,And with each inhabitant finding their own,unique way of coming by,,this tower becomes like a living city,,a place which is alive with micro-economies,and small businesses.,The inventive inhabitants, for instance,,find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,,like the adjacent parking garage,,which has been reclaimed as a taxi route,to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps,in order to shorten the hike,up to the apartments. 
 A walk through the tower,reveals how residents have figured out,how to create walls, how to make an air flow,,how to create transparency,,circulation throughout the tower,,essentially creating a home,that's completely adapted,to the conditions of the site.,When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,,they already have a roof over their head,,so they just typically mark their space,with a few curtains or sheets.,Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,,and people create a space out of any found objects,or materials. 
 It's remarkable to see the design decisions,that they're making,,like when everything is made out of red bricks,,some residents will cover that red brick,with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper,just to make it a kind of clean finish. 
 The inhabitants literally built up these homes,with their own hands, and this labor of love,instills a great sense of pride,in many families living in this tower.,They typically make the best out of their conditions,,and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,,or at least up until as far as they can reach.,Throughout the tower, you come across,all kinds of services, like the barber,,small factories, and every floor has,a little grocery store or shop.,And you even find a church.,And on the 30th floor, there is a gym,where all the weights and barbells,are made out of the leftover pulleys,from the elevators which were never installed.,From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,,you see how the fixed concrete beams,provide a framework for the inhabitants,to create their homes,in an organic, intuitive way,that responds directly to their needs. 
 Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,,to a community called Makoko,,a slum where 150,000 people,live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.,While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,,when you see it from above, there seems to be,a whole grid of waterways and canals,connecting each and every home.,From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes,which carry them out to their various homes and shops,located in the expansive area.,When out on the water, it's clear,that life has been completely adapted,to this very specific way of living.,Even the canoes become variety stores,where ladies paddle from house to house,,selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.,Behind every window and door frame,,you'll see a small child peering back at you,,and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,,what's more shocking is actually,the amount of children pouring out of every building.,The population growth in Nigeria,,and especially in these areas like Makoko,,are painful reminders,of how out of control things really are. 
 In Makoko, very few systems,and infrastructures exist.,Electricity is rigged and freshest water,comes from self-built wells throughout the area.,This entire economic model,is designed to meet a specific way of living,on the water, so fishing and boat-making,are common professions.,You'll have a set of entrepreneurs,who have set up businesses throughout the area,,like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,,movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.,There is even a photo studio,where you see the sort of aspiration,to live in a real house or to be associated,with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden. 
 On this particular evening,,I came across this live band,dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.,They were floating through the canals,in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator,for all of the community to enjoy. 
 By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,,save for a small lightbulb,or a fire. 
 What originally brought me to Makoko,was this project from a friend of mine,,Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building,this three-story floating school,for the kids in Makoko.,With this entire village existing on the water,,public space is very limited,,so now that the school is finished,,the ground floor is a playground for the kids,,but when classes are out, the platform,is just like a town square,,where the fishermen mend their nets,and floating shopkeepers dock their boats. 
 Another place I'd like to share with you,is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.,They're descendants of farmers who began migrating,from the upper Egypt in the '40s,,and today they make their living,by collecting and recycling waste from homes,from all over Cairo.,For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages,where they would move around,trying to avoid the local authorities,,but in the early 1980s, they settled,on the Mokattam rocks,just at the eastern edge of the city.,Today, they live in this area,,approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,,who live in this community of self-built,multi-story houses,where up to three generations live in one structure.,While these apartments that they built for themselves,appear to lack any planning or formal grid,,each family specializing in a certain form of recycling,means that the ground floor of each apartment,is reserved for garbage-related activities,and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.,I find it incredible to see,how these piles and piles of garbage,are invisible to the people who live there,,like this very distinguished man who is posing,while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,,or like these two young men who are sitting,and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.,While to most of us, living amongst,these piles and piles of garbage,may seem totally uninhabitable,,to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just,a different type of normal.,In all these places I've talked about today,,what I do find fascinating is that there's really,no such thing as normal,,and it proves that people are able to adapt,to any kind of situation.,Throughout the day, it's quite common,to come across a small party taking place,in the streets, just like this engagement party.,In this tradition, the bride-to-be,displays all of their belongings,,which they soon bring to their new husband.,A gathering like this one,offers such a juxtaposition,where all the new stuff is displayed,and all the garbage is used,as props to display all their new home accessories.,Like Makoko and the Torre David,,throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all,the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.,There are the retail shops, the cafes,and the restaurants, and the community,is this community of Coptic Christians,,so you'll also find a church,,along with the scores of religious iconographies,throughout the area,,and also all the everyday services,like the electronic repair shops,,the barbers, everything. 
 Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen,is also full of surprises.,While from the outside,,these homes look like any other informal structure,in the city, when you step inside,,you are met with all manner of design decisions,and interior decoration.,Despite having limited access to space and money,,the homes in the area are designed,with care and detail.,Every apartment is unique,,and this individuality tells a story,about each family's circumstances and values.,Many of these people take their homes,and interior spaces very seriously,,putting a lot of work and care,into the details.,The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,,where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns. 
 But despite this elaborate decor,,sometimes these apartments are used,in very unexpected ways,,like this home which caught my attention,while all the mud and the grass was literally,seeping out under the front door.,When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment,was being transformed into a complete animal farm,,where six or seven cows stood grazing,in what otherwise would be the living room.,But then in the apartment across the hall,from this cow shed lives a newly married couple,in what locals describe,as one of the nicest apartments in the area. 
 The attention to this detail astonished me,,and as the owner of the home so proudly,led me around this apartment,,from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.,But if it weren't for the strangely familiar,stomach-churning odor that constantly,passes through the apartment,,it would be easy to forget,that you are standing next to a cow shed,and on top of a landfill.,What moved me the most was that despite,these seemingly inhospitable conditions,,I was welcomed with open arms,into a home that was made with love, care,,and unreserved passion. 
 Let's move across the map to China,,to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.,In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,,there lived until recently an estimated,40 million people in these houses underground.,These dwellings are called the yaodongs.,Through this architecture by subtraction,,these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.,In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,,and hidden behind these mounds of dirt,are these square, rectangular houses,which sit seven meters below the ground.,When I asked people why they were digging,their houses from the ground,,they simply replied that they are poor wheat,and apple farmers who didn't have the money,to buy materials, and this digging out,was their most logical form of living. 
 From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities,have approached the tasks of planning,,design and management of their communities,and neighborhoods in ways that respond,specifically to their environment and circumstances.,Created by these very people who live,,work and play in these particular spaces,,these neighborhoods are intuitively designed,to make the most of their circumstances.,In most of these places, the government,is completely absent, leaving inhabitants,with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,,and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,,they do present examples,of brilliant forms of ingenuity,,and prove that indeed we have the ability,to adapt to all manner of circumstances.,What makes places like the Torre David,particularly remarkable,is this sort of skeleton framework,where people can have a foundation,where they can tap into.,Now imagine what these already ingenious communities,could create themselves,,and how highly particular their solutions would be,,if they were given the basic infrastructures,that they could tap into. 
 Today, you see these large residential development projects,which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions,to massive amounts of people.,From China to Brazil, these projects attempt,to provide as many houses as possible,,but they're completely generic,and simply do not work as an answer,to the individual needs of the people. 
 I would like to end with a quote,from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,,Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful,Shorefast Foundation,,based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.,She says that "there's this plague of sameness,which is killing the human joy,",and I couldn't agree with her more. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)If you remember that first decade of the web,,it was really a static place.,You could go online, you could look at pages,,and they were put up either by organizations,who had teams to do it,or by individuals who were really tech-savvy,for the time.,And with the rise of social media,and social networks in the early 2000s,,the web was completely changed,to a place where now the vast majority of content,we interact with is put up by average users,,either in YouTube videos or blog posts,or product reviews or social media postings.,And it's also become a much more interactive place,,where people are interacting with others,,they're commenting, they're sharing,,they're not just reading. 
 So Facebook is not the only place you can do this,,but it's the biggest,,and it serves to illustrate the numbers.,Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month.,So half the Earth's Internet population,is using Facebook.,They are a site, along with others,,that has allowed people to create an online persona,with very little technical skill,,and people responded by putting huge amounts,of personal data online.,So the result is that we have behavioral,,preference, demographic data,for hundreds of millions of people,,which is unprecedented in history.,And as a computer scientist, nwhat this means is that,I've been able to build models,that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes,for all of you that you don't even know,you're sharing information about.,As scientists, we use that to help,the way people interact online,,but there's less altruistic applications,,and there's a problem in that users don't really,understand these techniques and how they work,,and even if they did, they don'tnhave a lot of control over it.,So what I want to talk to you about today,is some of these things that we're able to do,,and then give us some ideasnof how we might go forward,to move some control back into the hands of users. 
 So this is Target, the company.,I didn't just put that logo,on this poor, pregnant woman's belly.,You may have seen this anecdote that was printed,in Forbes magazine where Target,sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl,with advertisements and coupons,for baby bottles and diapers and cribs,two weeks before she told her parents,that she was pregnant.,Yeah, the dad was really upset.,He said, "How did Target figure out,that this high school girl was pregnant,before she told her parents?",It turns out that they have the purchase history,for hundreds of thousands of customers,and they compute what they ncall a pregnancy score,,which is not just whether or nnot a woman's pregnant,,but what her due date is.,And they compute that,not by looking at the obvious things,,like, she's buying a crib or baby clothes,,but things like, she bought more vitamins,than she normally had,,or she bought a handbag,that's big enough to hold diapers.,And by themselves, those purchases don't seem,like they might reveal a lot,,but it's a pattern of behavior that,,when you take it in the context nof thousands of other people,,starts to actually reveal some insights.,So that's the kind of thing that we do,when we're predicting stuffnabout you on social media.,We're looking for littlenpatterns of behavior that,,when you detect them among millions of people,,lets us find out all kinds of things. 
 So in my lab and with colleagues,,we've developed mechanisms where we can,quite accurately predict things,like your political preference,,your personality score, gender, sexual orientation,,religion, age, intelligence,,along with things like,how much you trust the people you know,and how strong those relationships are.,We can do all of this really well.,And again, it doesn't come from what you might,think of as obvious information. 
 So my favorite example is from this study,that was published this year,in the Proceedings of the National Academies.,If you Google this, you'll find it.,It's four pages, easy to read.,And they looked at just people's Facebook likes,,so just the things you like on Facebook,,and used that to predict all these attributes,,along with some other ones.,And in their paper they listed the five likes,that were most indicative of high intelligence.,And among those was liking a page,for curly fries. (Laughter),Curly fries are delicious,,but liking them does not necessarily mean,that you're smarter than the average person.,So how is it that one of the strongest indicators,of your intelligence,is liking this page,when the content is totally irrelevant,to the attribute that's being predicted?,And it turns out that we have to look at,a whole bunch of underlying theories,to see why we're able to do this.,One of them is a sociologicalntheory called homophily,,which basically says people arenfriends with people like them.,So if you're smart, you tend tonbe friends with smart people,,and if you're young, you tendnto be friends with young people,,and this is well established,for hundreds of years.,We also know a lot,about how information spreads through networks.,It turns out things like viral videos,or Facebook likes or other information,spreads in exactly the same way,that diseases spread through social networks.,So this is something we've studied for a long time.,We have good models of it.,And so you can put those things together,and start seeing why things like this happen.,So if I were to give you a hypothesis,,it would be that a smart guy started this page,,or maybe one of the first people who liked it,would have scored high on that test.,And they liked it, and their friends saw it,,and by homophily, we know thatnhe probably had smart friends,,and so it spread to them, nand some of them liked it,,and they had smart friends,,and so it spread to them,,and so it propagated through the network,to a host of smart people,,so that by the end, the action,of liking the curly fries page,is indicative of high intelligence,,not because of the content,,but because the actual action of liking,reflects back the common attributes,of other people who have done it. 
 So this is pretty complicated stuff, right?,It's a hard thing to sit down and explain,to an average user, and even if you do,,what can the average user do about it?,How do you know that nyou've liked something,that indicates a trait for you,that's totally irrelevant to thencontent of what you've liked?,There's a lot of power that users don't have,to control how this data is used.,And I see that as a real nproblem going forward. 
 So I think there's a couple paths,that we want to look at,if we want to give users some control,over how this data is used,,because it's not always going to be used,for their benefit.,An example I often give is that,,if I ever get bored being a professor,,I'm going to go start a company,that predicts all of these attributes,and things like how well you work in teams,and if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic.,We know how to predict all that.,And I'm going to sell reports,to H.R. companies and big businesses,that want to hire you.,We totally can do that now.,I could start that business tomorrow,,and you would havenabsolutely no control,over me using your data like that.,That seems to me to be a problem. 
 So one of the paths we can go down,is the policy and law path.,And in some respects, I thinknthat that would be most effective,,but the problem is we'dnactually have to do it.,Observing our political process in action,makes me think it's highly unlikely,that we're going to get a bunch of representatives,to sit down, learn about this,,and then enact sweeping changes,to intellectual property law in the U.S.,so users control their data. 
 We could go the policy route,,where social media companies say,,you know what? You own your data.,You have total control over how it's used.,The problem is that the revenue models,for most social media companies,rely on sharing or exploiting nusers' data in some way.,It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users,aren't the customer, they're the product.,And so how do you get a company,to cede control of their main asset,back to the users?,It's possible, but I don't think it's something,that we're going to see change quickly. 
 So I think the other path,that we can go down that'sngoing to be more effective,is one of more science.,It's doing science that allowed us to develop,all these mechanisms for computing,this personal data in the first place.,And it's actually very similar research,that we'd have to do,if we want to develop mechanisms,that can say to a user,,"Here's the risk of that action you just took.",By liking that Facebook page,,or by sharing this piece of personal information,,you've now improved my ability,to predict whether or not you're using drugs,or whether or not you getnalong well in the workplace.,And that, I think, can affect whether or not,people want to share something,,keep it private, or just keep it offline altogether.,We can also look at things like,allowing people to encrypt data that they upload,,so it's kind of invisible and worthless,to sites like Facebook,or third party services that access it,,but that select users who the person who posted it,want to see it have access to see it.,This is all super exciting research,from an intellectual perspective,,and so scientists are going to be willing to do it.,So that gives us an advantage over the law side. 
 One of the problems that people bring up,when I talk about this is, they say,,you know, if people startnkeeping all this data private,,all those methods that you've been developing,to predict their traits are going to fail.,And I say, absolutely, and for me, that's success,,because as a scientist,,my goal is not to infer information about users,,it's to improve the way people interact online.,And sometimes that involvesninferring things about them,,but if users don't want me to use that data,,I think they should have the right to do that.,I want users to be informed and consenting,users of the tools that we develop. 
 And so I think encouraging this kind of science,and supporting researchers,who want to cede some of that control back to users,and away from the social media companies,means that going forward, as these tools evolve,and advance,,means that we're going to have an educated,and empowered user base,,and I think all of us can agree,that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In December of 2010,,the city of Apatzingán,in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,,awoke to gunfire.,For two straight days,,the city became an open battlefield,between the federal forces,and a well-organized group,,presumably from the local criminal organization,,La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.,The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire,but also explosions,and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,,so truly like a battlefield.,After these two days,,and during a particularly intense encounter,,it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,,Nazario Moreno, was killed. 
 In response to this terrifying violence,,the mayor of Apatzingán,decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.,The idea was to ask for a softer approach,to criminal activity in the state.,And so, the day of the scheduled procession,,thousands of people showed up.,As the mayor was preparing to deliver,the speech starting the march,,his team noticed,that, while half of the participants,were appropriately dressed in white,,and bearing banners asking for peace,,the other half was actually marching,in support of the criminal organization,and its now-presumed-defunct leader.,Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside,rather than participate or lead a procession,that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.,And so his team stepped aside.,The two marches joined together,,and they continued their path,towards the state capital. 
 This story of horrific violence,followed by a fumbled approach,by federal and local authorities as they tried,to engage civil society,,who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,,is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,,where we see that our current understanding,of drug violence and what leads to it,is probably at the very least incomplete. 
 If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying,to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico,by, say, just researching online,,the first thing you would find out is that,while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,,there are some that are more,and there are some that are much less equal than others,,because you will quickly find out,that in the past six years,anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people,have lost their lives in drug-related violence.,To put these numbers in perspective,,this is eight times larger than the number of casualties,in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.,It's also shockingly close to the number of people,who have died in the Syrian civil war,,which is an active civil war.,This is happening just south of the border. 
 Now as you're reading, however,,you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly,become numb to the numbers of deaths,,because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers,of faceless, nameless dead people.,Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative,that all the people who are dying,were somehow involved in the drug trade,,and we infer this because they were either tortured,or executed in a professional manner,,or, most likely, both.,And so clearly they were criminals,because of the way they died.,And so the narrative is that somehow these people,got what they were deserved.,They were part of the bad guys.,And that creates some form of comfort,for a lot of people. 
 However, while it's easier to think,of us, the citizens, the police, the army,,as the good guys, and them, the narcos,,the carteles, as the bad guys,,if you think about it,,the latter are only providing a service to the former.,Whether we like it or not,,the U.S. is the largest market,for illegal substances in the world,,accounting for more than half of global demand.,It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico,that is its only route of access from the South,,and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,,used to say, "Poor Mexico,,so far from God and so close to the United States." 
 The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users,of illegal drugs in the United States.,Using very, very conservative assumptions,,this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side,of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.,If we assume that the narcos only have access,to the wholesale part, which we know is false,,that still leaves you with yearly revenues,of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.,To put these numbers in perspective,,Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.,And it so happens that this is a product that,,because of its nature, a business model,to address this market requires you,to guarantee to your producers,that their product will be reliably placed,in the markets where it is consumed.,And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,,is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors,that are used to transport drugs.,Hence the violence.,If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,,you will see that it almost perfectly aligns,with the most efficient routes of transportation,from the south to the north.,The only thing that the cartels are doing,is that they're trying to protect their business. 
 It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,,but it's also a complex one.,For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant,that can only grow in certain latitudes,,and so it means that a business model,to address this market requires you to have,decentralized, international production,,that by the way needs to have good quality control,,because people need a good high,that is not going to kill them,and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.,And so that means they need to secure,production and quality control in the south,,and you need to ensure that you have,efficient and effective distribution channels,in the markets where these drugs are consumed.,I urge you, but only a little bit,,because I don't want to get you in trouble,,to just ask around and see how difficult it would be,to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,,whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,,and some of you may be surprised to know,that there are many dealers that offer a service,where if you send them a text message,,they guarantee delivery of the drug,in 30 minutes or less. 
 Think about this for a second.,Think about the complexity,of the distribution network that I just described.,It's very difficult to reconcile this,with the image of faceless, ignorant goons,that are just shooting each other,,very difficult to reconcile. 
 Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,,an effective organization requires,an integrated strategy that includes,a good organizational structure, good incentives,,a solid identity and good brand management.,This leads me to the second thing that you would learn,in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.,Because you would quickly realize,,and maybe be confused by the fact,,that there are three organizations,that are constantly named in the articles.,You will hear about Los Zetas,,the Knights Templar, which is the new brand,for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,,and the Sinaloa Federation.,You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment,of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter,and they silence the press,,and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.,But this is the result of a very careful branding,and business strategy.,You see, Los Zetas is not just,this random assortment of individuals,,but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,,that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.,When that corridor became contested, they decided,that they wanted to recruit,a professional enforcement arm.,So they recruited Los Zetas:,an entire unit of elite paratroopers,from the Mexican Army.,They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,,so much so that at some point, they decided,to just take over the operations,,which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,,because they grow up.,Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,,they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution,in the most profitable markets like cocaine,,but what they did have,,and this is again based on their military origin,,was a perfectly structured chain of command,with a very clear hierarchy,and a very clear promotion path that allowed them,to supervise and operate across many, many markets,very effectively,,which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.,And so because they didn't have access,to the more profitable drug markets,,this pushed them and gave them the opportunity,to diversify into other forms of crime.,That includes kidnapping, prostitution,,local drug dealing and human trafficking,,including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.,So what they currently run is truly,and quite literally a franchise business.,They focus most of their recruiting on the army,,and they very openly advertise for better salaries,,better benefits, better promotion paths,,not to mention much better food,,than what the army can deliver.,The way they operate is that,when they arrive in a locality,,they let people know that they are there,,and they go to the most powerful local gang,and they say, "I offer you,to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.",If they agree -- and you don't want to know,what happens if they don't --,they train them and they supervise them,on how to run the most efficient criminal operation,for that town, in exchange for royalties.,This kind of business model obviously depends,entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,,and so Los Zetas,carefully stage acts of violence,that are spectacular in nature,,especially when they arrive first in a city,,but again, that's just a brand strategy.,I'm not saying they're not violent,,but what I am saying is that even though you will read,that they are the most violent of all,,when you count, when you do the body count,,they're actually all the same. 
 In contrast to them, the Knights Templar,that arose in Michoacán,emerged in reaction to the incursion,of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.,Michoacán is a geographically strategic state,because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,,and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,,which then gives you direct access to the U.S.,The Knights Templar realized very quickly,that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,,and so they developed a strategy,as a social enterprise.,They brand themselves as representative of,and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán,against organized crime.,Their brand of social enterprise means,that they require a lot of civic engagement,,so they invest heavily in providing local services,,like dealing with home violence,,going after petty criminals, treating addicts,,and keeping drugs out of the local markets,where they are,,and, of course, protecting people,from other criminal organizations.,Now, they kill a lot of people too,,but when they kill them,,they provide very careful narratives and descriptions,for why they did them,,through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,,and billboards that explain that the people who were killed,were killed because they represented a threat,not to us, as an organization, of course,,but to you, as citizens.,And so we're actually here to protect you.,They, as social enterprises do,,have created a moral and ethical code,that they advertise around,,and they have very strict recruiting practices.,And here you have the types of explanations,that they provide for some of their actions.,They have actually retained access,to the profitable drug trade,,but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,,and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,,they leverage that to, for example,,trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created,and legally extracted,with illegal ephedrine from China,which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines,that they produce, and then they have partnerships,with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation,that place their products in the U.S. 
 Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.,When you read about them, you will often read about them,with an undertone of reverence and admiration,,because they are the most integrated,and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,,and, many people argue, the world.,They started as just sort of a transport organization,that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.,and the Mexican borders,,but now they have grown,into a truly integrated multinational,that has partnerships in production in the south,and partnerships in global distribution,across the planet.,They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,,business acumen and innovation.,They have designed new drug products,and new drug processes.,They have designed narco-tunnels,that go across the border,,and you can see that these are not,"The Shawshank Redemption" types.,They have invented narco-submarines and boats,that are not detected by radar.,They have invented drones to transport drugs,,catapults, you name it.,One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation,actually made it to the Forbes list. 
 [#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera] 
 Like any multinational would, they have specialized,and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,,which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,,heroine, methamphetamines.,Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,,the way they control their operations,is through family ties.,When they're entering a new market, they send,a family member to supervise it,,or, if they're partnering with a new organization,,they create a family tie,,either through marriages or other types of ties.,Like any other multinational would,,they protect their brand by outsourcing,the more questionable parts of the business model,,like for example, when they have to engage,in violence against other criminal organizations,,they recruit gangs and other smaller players,to do the dirty work for them,,and they try to separate their operations,and their violence and be very discrete about this. 
 To further strengthen their brand,,they actually have professional P.R. firms,that shape how the press talks about them.,They have professional videographers on staff.,They have incredibly productive ties,with the security organizations,on both sides of the border. 
 And so, differences aside,,what these three organizations share,is on the one hand, a very clear understanding,that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,,but rather they are built from the bottom up,one interaction at a time.,They have created extremely coherent structures,that they use to show the inconsistencies,in government policies. 
 And so what I want you to remember from this talk,are three things.,The first one is that drug violence,is actually the result,of a huge market demand,and an institutional setup that forces,the servicing of this market to necessitate violence,to guarantee delivery routes.,The second thing I want you to remember,is that these are sophisticated,,coherent organizations,that are business organizations,,and analyzing them and treating them as such,is probably a much more useful approach.,The third thing I want you to remember,is that even though we're more comfortable,with this idea of "them,",a set of bad guys separated from us,,we are actually accomplices to them,,either through our direct consumption,or through our acceptance of the inconsistency,between our policies of prohibition,and our actual behavior of tolerance,or even encouragement of consumption. 
 These organizations service, recruit from,,and operate within our communities,,so necessarily, they are much more integrated,within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.,And so to me the question is not whether,these dynamics will continue the way they have.,We see that the nature of this phenomenon,guarantees that they will.,The question is whether we are willing to continue,our support of a failed strategy,based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance,at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want you to, for a moment,,think about playing a game of Monopoly.,Except in this game,nthat combination of skill, talent and luck,that helped earn you successnin games, as in life,,has been rendered irrelevant,,because this game's been rigged,,and you've got the upper hand.,You've got more money,,more opportunities to movenaround the board,,and more access to resources.,And as you think about that experience,,I want you to ask yourself:,How might that experience of beingna privileged player in a rigged game,change the way you think about yourself,and regard that other player? 
 So, we ran a studynon the UC Berkeley campus,to look at exactly that question.,We brought in more than 100 pairsnof strangers into the lab,,and with the flip of a coin,,randomly assigned one of the twonto be a rich player in a rigged game.,They got two times as much money;,when they passed Go,nthey collected twice the salary;,and they got to rollnboth dice instead of one,,so they got to movenaround the board a lot more. 
 (Laughter) 
 And over the course of 15 minutes,,we watched throughnhidden cameras what happened.,What I want to do today,nfor the first time,,is show you a little bit of what we saw.,You'll to have to pardonnthe sound quality,,because again, these were hidden cameras.,So we've provided subtitles. 
 [Video] Rich Player: How manyn500s did you have? 
 Poor Player: Just one. 
 RP: Are you serious?nPP: Yeah. 
 RP: I have three. (Laughs)nI don't know why they gave me so much. 
 Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparentnto players that something was up.,One person clearly hasna lot more money than the other person,,and yet, as the game unfolded,,we saw very notable differences,ndramatic differences begin to emerge,between the two players.,The rich player started to movenaround the board louder,,literally smacking the boardnwith the piece as he went around. 
 (Game piece smacks board) 
 We were more likelynto see signs of dominance,and nonverbal signs, displays of power,and celebration among the rich players. 
 We had a bowl of pretzelsnpositioned off to the side.,It's on the bottom right corner.,That allowed us to watchnparticipants' consummatory behavior.,So we're just trackingnhow many pretzels participants eat. 
 [Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick? 
 PP: I don't know. 
 Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises,npeople are on to us.,They wonder what that bowl of pretzelsnis doing there in the first place.,One even asks, like you just saw,,"Is that bowl of pretzelsnthere as a trick?",And yet, despite that,nthe power of the situation,seems to inevitably dominate,,and those rich playersnstart to eat more pretzels. 
 (Laughter) 
 [Video] RP: I love pretzels. 
 (Laughter) 
 Paul Piff: And as the game went on,,one of the really interestingnand dramatic patterns,that we observed begin to emerge,was that the rich playersnactually started to become ruder,toward the other person --,less and less sensitive to the plightnof those poor, poor players,,and more and more demonstrativenof their material success,,more likely to showcasenhow well they're doing. 
 [Video] RP: I have money ... 
 (Laughs) I have money for everything. 
 PP: How much is that? 
 RP: You owe me 24 dollars.,You're going to lose all your money soon.,I'll buy it. I have so much money.,I have so much money, it takes me forever. 
 RP 2: I'm goingnto buy out this whole board. 
 RP 3: You're goingnto run out of money soon.,I'm pretty much untouchable at this point. 
 (Laughter) 
 Paul Piff: And here's what I thinknwas really, really interesting:,it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,,we asked the players to talknabout their experience during the game.,And when the rich players talkednabout why they had inevitably won,in this rigged game of Monopoly ... 
 (Laughter) 
 They talked about what they'd donento buy those different properties,and earn their success in the game. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they became far less attuned,to all those differentnfeatures of the situation --,including that flip of a coin --,that had randomly gotten themninto that privileged position,in the first place.,And that's a really,nreally incredible insight,into how the mindnmakes sense of advantage. 
 Now, this game of Monopoly can be used,as a metaphor for understanding societynand its hierarchical structure,,wherein some peoplenhave a lot of wealth and a lot of status,,and a lot of people don't;,they have a lot less wealthnand a lot less status,and a lot less access to valued resources.,And what my colleagues and Infor the last seven years have been doing,is studying the effectsnof these kinds of hierarchies.,What we've been findingnacross dozens of studies,and thousands of participantsnacross this country,is that as a person's levelsnof wealth increase,,their feelings of compassionnand empathy go down,,and their feelings of entitlement,nof deservingness,,and their ideologynof self-interest increase.,In surveys, we've found,that it's actually wealthier individualsnwho are more likely to moralize,greed being good,,and that the pursuit of self-interestnis favorable and moral.,Now, what I want to do todaynis talk about some of the implications,of this ideology self-interest,,talk about why we shouldncare about those implications,,and end with what might be done. 
 Some of the first studiesnthat we ran in this area,looked at helping behavior,,something social psychologistsncall "pro-social behavior.",And we were really interested,in who's more likelynto offer help to another person:,someone who's rich or someone who's poor.,In one of the studies,,we bring rich and poor membersnof the community into the lab,,and give each of themnthe equivalent of 10 dollars.,We told the participants they could keepnthese 10 dollars for themselves,,or they could sharena portion of it, if they wanted to,,with a stranger, who's totally anonymous.,They'll never meet that stranger;nthe stranger will never meet them.,And we just monitor how much people give.,Individuals who made 25,000,nsometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,,gave 44 percent morenof their money to the stranger,than did individuals makingn150,000, 200,000 dollars a year. 
 We've had people play games,to see who's more or less likely to cheat,to increase their chancesnof winning a prize.,In one of the games,nwe actually rigged a computer,so that die rolls over a certain scorenwere impossible --,You couldn't get above 12nin this game, and yet ...,the richer you were, the more likelynyou were to cheat in this game,to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --,sometimes by three to four times as much. 
 We ran another study,where we looked at whether peoplenwould be inclined to take candy,from a jar of candynthat we explicitly identified,as being reserved for children -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not kidding -- I know it soundsnlike I'm making a joke.,We explicitly told participants:,"This candy is for children participatingnin a developmental lab nearby.,They're in studies. This is for them.",And we just monitorednhow much candy participants took.,Participants who felt richntook two times as much candy,as participants who felt poor. 
 We've even studied cars.,Not just any cars,,but whether driversnof different kinds of cars,are more or less inclinednto break the law.,In one of these studies,,we looked at whether driversnwould stop for a pedestrian,that we had posed waitingnto cross at a crosswalk.,Now in California, as you all know,,because I'm sure we all do this,,it's the law to stop for a pedestriannwho's waiting to cross.,So here's an example of how we did it.,That's our confederate off to the left,nposing as a pedestrian.,He approaches as the red trucknsuccessfully stops.,In typical California fashion,,it's overtaken by the busnwho almost runs our pedestrian over. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now here's an examplenof a more expensive car,,a Prius, driving through,nand a BMW doing the same.,So we did this for hundreds of vehicles,on several days,,just tracking who stops and who doesn't.,What we found was as the expensivenessnof a car increased ... 
 (Laughter) 
 the drivers' tendenciesnto break the law increased as well.,None of the cars -- none of the cars --,in our least expensive car category,broke the law.,Close to 50 percent of the carsnin our most expensive vehicle category,broke the law.,We've run other studies,,finding that wealthier individualsnare more likely to lie in negotiations,,to endorse unethical behavior at work,,like stealing cash from the cash register,,taking bribes, lying to customers. 
 Now, I don't mean to suggest,that it's only wealthy peoplenwho show these patterns of behavior.,Not at all -- in fact,nI think that we all,,in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,,struggle with these competing motivations,of when or if to put our own interestsnabove the interests of other people.,And that's understandable,,because the American dream is an idea,in which we all have an equal opportunitynto succeed and prosper,,as long as we applynourselves and work hard.,And a piece of that means that sometimes,,you need to put your own interests,above the interests and well-beingnof other people around you.,But what we're findingnis that the wealthier you are,,the more likely you are to pursuena vision of personal success,,of achievement and accomplishment,,to the detriment of others around you. 
 Here I've plotted for younthe mean household income,received by each fifthnand top five percent of the population,over the last 20 years.,In 1993,,the differences between the differentnquintiles of the population,,in terms of income,,are fairly egregious.,It's not difficult to discernnthat there are differences.,But over the last 20 years,nthat significant difference,has become a Grand Canyon of sorts,between those at the topnand everyone else.,In fact, the top 20 percentnof our population,own close to 90 percentnof the total wealth in this country. 
 We're at unprecedented levelsnof economic inequality.,What that means is that wealth is not onlynbecoming increasingly concentrated,in the hands of a select groupnof individuals,,but the American dreamnis becoming increasingly unattainable,for an increasing majority of us.,And if it's the case,nas we've been finding,,that the wealthier you are,,the more entitled you feel to that wealth,,and the more likely you arento prioritize your own interests,above the interests of other people,,and be willing to do thingsnto serve that self-interest,,well, then, there's no reason to thinknthat those patterns will change.,In fact, there's every reasonnto think that they'll only get worse,,and that's what it would look likenif things just stayed the same,,at the same linear rate,nover the next 20 years. 
 Now inequality -- economic inequality --,is something we shouldnall be concerned about,,and not just because of thosenat the bottom of the social hierarchy,,but because individuals and groups,with lots of economicninequality do worse ...,not just the peoplenat the bottom, everyone.,There's a lot of reallyncompelling research,coming out from top labsnall over the world,,showcasing the range of thingsnthat are undermined,as economic inequality gets worse.,Social mobility,nthings we really care about,,physical health, social trust,,all go down as inequality goes up.,Similarly, negative thingsnin social collectives and societies,,things like obesity, and violence,,imprisonment, and punishment,,are exacerbated as economicninequality increases.,Again, these are outcomesnnot just experienced by a few,,but that resoundnacross all strata of society.,Even people at the topnexperience these outcomes. 
 So what do we do?,This cascade of self-perpetuating,,pernicious, negative effects,could seem like somethingnthat's spun out of control,,and there's nothing we can do about it,,certainly nothingnwe as individuals could do.,But in fact, we've been findingnin our own laboratory research,that small psychological interventions,,small changes to people's values,,small nudges in certain directions,,can restore levelsnof egalitarianism and empathy.,For instance, reminding peoplenof the benefits of cooperation,or the advantages of community,,cause wealthier individualsnto be just as egalitarian,as poor people. 
 In one study, we had people watchna brief video, just 46 seconds long,,about childhood poverty,that served as a reminder of the needsnof others in the world around them.,And after watching that,,we looked at how willing peoplenwere to offer up their own time,to a stranger presented to themnin the lab, who was in distress.,After watching this video, an hour later,,rich people becamenjust as generous of their own time,to help out this other person, a stranger,,as someone who's poor,,suggesting that these differencesnare not innate or categorical,,but are so malleablento slight changes in people's values,,and little nudges of compassionnand bumps of empathy. 
 And beyond the walls of our lab,,we're even beginning to seensigns of change in society.,Bill Gates, one of our nation'snwealthiest individuals,,in his Harvard commencement speech,,talked about the problemnof inequality facing society,as being the most daunting challenge,,and talked about what mustnbe done to combat it,,saying, "Humanity's greatest advancesnare not in its discoveries --,but in how those discoveries are applied,to reduce inequity.",And there's the Giving Pledge,,in which more than 100nof our nation's wealthiest individuals,are pledging halfnof their fortunes to charity.,And there's the emergence of dozensnof grassroots movements,,like "We are the 1 percent,","Resource Generation,",or "Wealth for Common Good,",in which the most privilegednmembers of the population,,members of the one percent and elsewhere,,people who are wealthy,,are using their own economic resources,,adults and youth alike --nthat's what's most striking to me --,leveraging their own privilege,ntheir own economic resources,,to combat inequality,by advocating for social policies,,changes in social values,and changes in people's behavior,that work againstntheir own economic interests,,but that may ultimatelynrestore the American dream. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to startnby asking you a question:,Is anyone familiarnwith the blue algae problem?,Okay, so most of you are.,I think we can all agreenit's a serious issue.,Nobody wants to drinknblue algae-contaminated water,,or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.,Right? 
 I hope you won't be disappointed,,but today,nI won't be talking about blue algae.,Instead,nI'll be talking about the main cause,at the root of this issue,,which I will be referring to asnthe phosphorus crisis.,Why have I chosen to talk to younabout the phosphorus crisis today?,For the simple reasonnthat nobody else is talking about it.,And by the end of my presentation,nI hope that the general public,will be more aware of this crisisnand this issue. 
 Now, the problem is that if I ask,,why do we find ourselvesnin this situation with blue algae?,The answer isnthat it comes from how we farm.,We use fertilizers in our farming,nchemical fertilizers.,Why do we use chemical fertilizersnin agriculture?,Basically, to help plants grownand to produce a better yield.,The issue is that this is set to engender,an environmental problemnthat is without precedent. 
 Before going further, let me give youna crash course in plant biology.,So, what does a plant neednin order to grow?,A plant, quite simply,nneeds light, it needs CO2,,but even more importantly,nit needs nutrients,,which it draws from the soil.,Several of these nutrientsnare essential chemical elements:,phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.,So, the plant’s roots will extractnthese resources. 
 Today I'll be focusing on a major problemnthat is linked to phosphorus.,Why phosphorus in particular?,Because it isnthe most problematic chemical element.,By the end of my presentation,nyou will have seen,what these problems are,nand where we are today. 
 Phosphorus is a chemical element,that is essential to life.nThis is a very important point.,I’d like everyone to understand preciselynwhat the phosphorus issue is.,Phosphorus is a key componentnin several molecules,,in many of our molecules of life.,Experts in the field will know,that cellular communicationnis phosphorus-based --,phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.,Cell membranes are phosphorus-based:nThese are called phospholipids.,The energy in all living things,nATP, is phosphorus-based.,And more importantly still,nphosphorus is a key component of DNA,,something everyone is familiar with,nand which is shown in this image.,DNA is our genetic heritage.,It is extremely important, and once again,nphosphorus is a key player. 
 Now, where do we find this phosphorus?,As humans, where do we find it?,As I explained earlier,,plants extract phosphorusnfrom the soil, through water.,So, we humans get itnfrom the things we eat:,plants, vegetables, fruits,,and also from eggs, meat and milk.,It’s true that some humansneat better than others.,Some are happier than others.,And now, looking at this picture,nwhich speaks for itself,,we see modern agriculture,,which I also refer tonas intensive agriculture.,Intensive agriculture is basednon the use of chemical fertilizers.,Without them,nwe would not manage to produce enough,to feed the world's population.,Speaking of humans, there are currentlyn7 billion of us on Earth.,In less than 40 years,nthere will be 9 billion of us.,And the question is a simple one:nDo we have enough phosphorus,to feed our future generations? 
 So, in order to understand these issues,nwhere do we find our phosphorus?,Let me explain.,But first, let’s just suppose,that we are usingn100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.,Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.nEighty-five percent is lost.,It goes into the soil,nending its journey in the lakes,,resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,nwhich leads to the blue algae problem.,So, you’ll see there’s a problem here,nsomething that is illogical.,A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,nbut only 15 percent goes to the plant.,You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.,Yes, it is. What is worsenis that it is very expensive.,Nobody wants to throw their moneynout the window,,but unfortunatelynthat's what is happening here.,Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.,Modern agriculturendepends on phosphorus.,And because in order to get 15 percent of itnto the plant, all the rest is lost,,we have to add more and more. 
 Now, where will we getnthis phosphorus from?,Basically, we get it out of mines.,This is the covernof an extraordinary article,published in Nature in 2009,,which really launched the discussionnabout the phosphorus crisis.,Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,nwhich is becoming increasingly scarce,,yet nobody is talking about it.,And everyone agrees:nPoliticians and scientists are in agreement,that we are headednfor a phosphorus crisis. 
 What you are seeing herenis an open-pit mine in the U.S.,,and to give you an ideanof the dimensions of this mine,,if you look in the top right-hand corner,nthe little crane you can see,,that is a giant crane.,So that really puts it into perspective.,So, we get phosphorus from mines.,And if I make a comparison with oil,,there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it,nwe talk about global warming,,yet we never mentionnthe phosphorus crisis.,To come back to the oil problem,noil is something we can replace.,We can use biofuels, or solar power,,or hydropower,nbut phosphorus is an essential element,,indispensable to life,nand we can’t replace it. 
 What is the current statenof the world's phosphorus reserves?,This graph gives you a rough ideanof where we are today.,The black line represents predictionsnfor phosphorus reserves.,In 2030, we’ll reach the peak.,By the end of this century,nit will all be gone.,The dotted line shows where we are today.,As you can see, they meet in 2030,nI’ll be retired by then.,But we are indeed headingnfor a major crisis,,and I’d like people to become awarenof this problem. 
 Do we have a solution?,What are we to do?nWe are faced with a paradox.,Less and less phosphorusnwill be available.,By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,,and according tonthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,,we will need to produce twice as much foodnin 2050 than we do today.,So, we will have less phosphorus,nbut we'll need to produce more food.,What should we do?,It truly is a paradoxical situation.,Do we have a solution,nor an alternative,which will allow us to optimizenphosphorus use? 
 Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.,The solution I'm offering today is onenthat has existed for a very long time,,even before plants existed on Earth,,and it's a microscopic mushroomnthat is very mysterious,,very simple,nand yet also extremely complex.,I've been fascinated by this little mushroomnfor over 16 years now.,It has led me to further my research,and to use it as a modelnfor my laboratory research. 
 This mushroom exists in symbiosisnwith the roots.,By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectionalnand mutually beneficial association,which is also called mycorrhiza.,This slide illustrates the elementsnof a mycorrhiza.,You’re looking at the root of wheat,,one of the world’s most important plants.,Normally, a root will find phosphorusnall by itself.,It will go in search of phosphorus,,but only within the one millimeternwhich surrounds it.,Beyond one millimeter,nthe root is ineffective.,It cannot go furthernin its search for phosphorus.,Now, imagine this tiny,nmicroscopic mushroom.,It grows much faster,,and is much better designednto seek out phosphorus.,It can go beyondnthe root’s one-millimeter scope,to seek out phosphorus. 
 I haven’t invented anything at all;,it's a biotechnology that has existednfor 450 million years.,And over time, this mushroomnhas evolved and adapted to seek out,even the tiniest trace of phosphorus,nand to put it to use,,to make it available to the plant.,What you’re seeing here,nin the real world, is a carrot root,,and the mushroomnwith its very fine filaments.,Looking closer,nwe can see that this mushroom,is very gentle in its penetration.,It will proliferatenbetween the root's cells,,eventually penetrating a cell,and starting to formna typical arbuscular structure,,which will considerably increasenthe exchange interface,between the plant and the mushroom.,And it is through this structurenthat mutual exchanges will occur.,It’s a win-win trade:,I give you phosphorus, and you feed me.,True symbiosis. 
 Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant,into the diagram I used earlier.,And instead of using a 100 percent dose,nI’m going to reduce it to 25 percent.,You’ll see that of this 25 percent,nmost will benefit the plant,,more than 90 percent.,A very small amount of phosphorusnwill remain in the soil.,That's completely natural.,What's more is that in certain cases,nwe don't even need to add phosphorus. 
 If you recall the graphsnI showed you earlier,,85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,,and the plants are unable to access it.,Even though it is present in the soil,nit is in insoluble form.,The plant is only able to seek outnsoluble forms.,The mushroom is capablenof dissolving this insoluble form,and making it availablenfor the plant to use.,To further support my argument,nhere is a picture that speaks for itself.,These are trialsnin a field of sorghum.,On the left side, you see the yieldnproduced using conventional agriculture,,with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.,On the other side,nthe dose was reduced to 50 percent,,and just look at the yield.,With only a half-dose,nwe achieved a better yield. 
 This is to show younthat this method works.,And in some cases, in Cuba,nMexico and India,,the dose can be reduced to 25 percent,nand in several other cases,,there's no need to addnany phosphorus at all,,because the mushrooms are so well adapted,to finding phosphorusnand drawing it from the soil.,This is an example of soy productionnin Canada.,Mycorrhiza was used in one fieldnbut not in the other.,And here, where blue indicates a better yield,nand yellow a weaker yield.,The black rectangle is the plot,from which the mycorrhiza was added.,In other words, as I already said,nI have invented nothing.,Mycorrhiza has existednfor 450 million years,,and it has even helpednmodern-day plant species to diversify. 
 So, this it isn't somethingnthat is still undergoing lab tests.,Mycorrhiza exists, it works,,it's produced at an industrial scalenand commercialized worldwide.,The problem isnthat people are not aware of it.,People like food producers and farmersnare still not aware of this problem.,We have a technology that works,,and one that, if used correctly,nwill alleviate some of the pressure,we are puttingnon the world's phosphorus reserves. 
 In conclusion,nI am a scientist and a dreamer.,I'm passionate about this topic.,So if you were to ask menwhat my retirement dream is,,which will be at the moment we reachnthat phosphorus peak,,it would be that we use one label,n"Made with mycorrhiza,",and that my children and grandchildren,buy products bearing that label too. 
 Thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)Science,,science has allowed us to know so much,about the far reaches of the universe,,which is at the same time tremendously important,and extremely remote,,and yet much, much closer,,much more directly related to us,,there are many things we don't really understand.,And one of them is the extraordinary,social complexity of the animals around us,,and today I want to tell you a few stories,of animal complexity. 
 But first, what do we call complexity?,What is complex?,Well, complex is not complicated.,Something complicated comprises many small parts,,all different, and each of them,has its own precise role in the machinery.,On the opposite, a complex system,is made of many, many similar parts,,and it is their interaction,that produces a globally coherent behavior.,Complex systems have many interacting parts,which behave according to simple, individual rules,,and this results in emergent properties.,The behavior of the system as a whole,cannot be predicted,from the individual rules only.,As Aristotle wrote,,the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.,But from Aristotle, let's move onto,a more concrete example of complex systems. 
 These are Scottish terriers.,In the beginning, the system is disorganized.,Then comes a perturbation: milk.,Every individual starts pushing in one direction,and this is what happens.,The pinwheel is an emergent property,of the interactions between puppies,whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk,and therefore to push in a random direction. 
 So it's all about finding the simple rules,from which complexity emerges.,I call this simplifying complexity,,and it's what we do at the chair of systems design,at ETH Zurich.,We collect data on animal populations,,analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.,It requires physicists who work with biologists,,with mathematicians and computer scientists,,and it is their interaction that produces,cross-boundary competence,to solve these problems.,So again, the whole is greater,than the sum of the parts.,In a way, collaboration,is another example of a complex system. 
 And you may be asking yourself,which side I'm on, biology or physics?,In fact, it's a little different,,and to explain, I need to tell you,a short story about myself.,When I was a child,,I loved to build stuff, toncreate complicated machines.,So I set out to study electrical engineering,and robotics,,and my end-of-studies project,was about building a robot called ER-1 --,it looked like this—,that would collect information from its environment,and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.,It was very, very complicated,,but it worked beautifully in our test room,,and on demo day, professors had nassembled to grade the project.,So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.,It turned out, the light in that room,was slightly different.,The robot's vision system got confused.,At the first bend in the line,,it left its course, and crashed into a wall.,We had spent weeks building it,,and all it took to destroy it,was a subtle change in the color of the light,in the room.,That's when I realized that,the more complicated you make a machine,,the more likely that it will fail,due to something absolutely unexpected.,And I decided that, in fact,,I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.,I wanted to understand complexity,,the complexity of the world around us,and especially in the animal kingdom. 
 Which brings us to bats.,Bechstein's bats are a commonnspecies of European bats.,They are very social animals.,Mostly they roost, or sleep, together.,And they live in maternity colonies,,which means that every spring,,the females meet after the winter hibernation,,and they stay together for about six months,to rear their young,,and they all carry a very small chip,,which means that every time one of them,enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,,we know where she is,,and more importantly,,we know with whom she is.,So I study roosting associations in bats,,and this is what it looks like.,During the day, the bats roost,in a number of sub-groups in different boxes.,It could be that on one day,,the colony is split between two boxes,,but on another day,,it could be together in a single box,,or split between three or more boxes,,and that all seems rather erratic, really.,It's called fission-fusion dynamics,,the property for an animal group,of regularly splitting and merging,into different subgroups. 
 So what we do is take all these data,from all these different days,and pool them together,to extract a long-term association pattern,by applying techniques with network analysis,to get a complete picture,of the social structure of the colony.,Okay? So that's what this picture looks like.,In this network, all the circles,are nodes, individual bats,,and the lines between them,are social bonds, associations between individuals.,It turns out this is a very interesting picture.,This bat colony is organized,in two different communities,which cannot be predicted,from the daily fission-fusion dynamics.,We call them cryptic social units.,Even more interesting, in fact:,Every year, around October,,the colony splits up,,and all bats hibernate separately,,but year after year,,when the bats come together again in the spring,,the communities stay the same. 
 So these bats remember their friends,for a really long time.,With a brain the size of a peanut,,they maintain individualized,,long-term social bonds,,We didn't know that was possible.,We knew that primates,and elephants and dolphins could do that,,but compared to bats, they have huge brains.,So how could it be,that the bats maintain this complex,,stable social structure,with such limited cognitive abilities? 
 And this is where complexity brings an answer.,To understand this system,,we built a computer model of roosting,,based on simple, individual rules,,and simulated thousands and thousands of days,in the virtual bat colony.,It's a mathematical model,,but it's not complicated.,What the model told us is that, in a nutshell,,each bat knows a few other colony members,as her friends, and is just slightly more likely,to roost in a box with them.,Simple, individual rules.,This is all it takes to explain,the social complexity of these bats. 
 But it gets better.,Between 2010 and 2011,,the colony lost more than two thirds of its members,,probably due to the very cold winter.,The next spring, it didn't form two communities,like every year,,which may have led the whole colony to die,because it had become too small.,Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,,which allowed the colony to survive that season,and thrive again in the next two years.,What we know is that the bats,are not aware that their colony is doing this.,All they do is follow simple association rules,,and from this simplicity,emerges social complexity,which allows the colony to be resilient,against dramatic changesnin the population structure.,And I find this incredible. 
 Now I want to tell you another story,,but for this we have to travel from Europe,to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.,This is where meerkats live.,I'm sure you know meerkats.,They're fascinating creatures.,They live in groups with anvery strict social hierarchy.,There is one dominant pair,,and many subordinates,,some acting as sentinels,,some acting as babysitters,,some teaching pups, and so on.,What we do is put very small GPS collars,on these animals,to study how they move together,,and what this has to do with their social structure.,And there's a very interesting example,of collective movement in meerkats.,In the middle of the reserve which they live in,lies a road.,On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.,But the meerkats have to cross it,to get from one feeding place to another.,So we asked, how exactly do they do this?,We found that the dominant female,is mostly the one who leads the group to the road,,but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,,she gives way to the subordinates,,a manner of saying,,"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe.",What I didn't know, in fact,,was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow,for this change at the edge of the group to happen,and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it. 
 So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats,crossing a simulated road.,It's a simplistic model.,Moving meerkats are like random particles,whose unique rule is one of alignment.,They simply move together.,When these particles get to the road,,they sense some kind of obstacle,,and they bounce against it.,The only difference,between the dominant female, here in red,,and the other individuals,,is that for her, the height of the obstacle,,which is in fact the risk perceived from the road,,is just slightly higher,,and this tiny difference,in the individual's rule of movement,is sufficient to explain what we observe,,that the dominant female,leads her group to the road,and then gives way to the others,for them to cross first.,George Box, who was an English statistician,,once wrote, "All models are false,,but some models are useful.",And in fact, this model is obviously false,,because in reality, meerkats arenanything but random particles.,But it's also useful,,because it tells us that extreme simplicity,in movement rules at the individual level,can result in a great deal of complexity,at the level of the group.,So again, that's simplifying complexity. 
 I would like to conclude,on what this means for the whole species.,When the dominant female,gives way to a subordinate,,it's not out of courtesy.,In fact, the dominant female,is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.,If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.,So this behavior of risk avoidance,is a very old evolutionary response.,These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic,that is thousands of generations old,,and they're adapting it to a modern risk,,in this case a road built by humans.,They adapt very simple rules,,and the resulting complex behavior,allows them to resist human encroachment,into their natural habitat. 
 In the end,,it may be bats which change their social structure,in response to a population crash,,or it may be meerkats,who show a novel adaptation to a human road,,or it may be another species.,My message here -- and it's not a complicated one,,but a simple one of wonder and hope --,my message here is that animals,show extraordinary social complexity,,and this allows them to adapt,and respond to changes in their environment.,In three words, in the animal kingdom,,simplicity leads to complexity,which leads to resilience. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,,for this great start. Little bit nervous?,Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.,DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a nlot of people in the audience,somehow tried to make associations,between the animals you were talking about --,the bats, meerkats -- and humans.,You brought some examples:,The females are the social ones,,the females are the dominant ones,,I'm not sure who thinks how.,But is it okay to do these associations?,Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard,that can be valid across all species?,NP: Well, I would say there are also,counter-examples to these stereotypes.,For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,,it is the males who take care of the young always.,And the lesson is that it's often difficult,,and sometimes even a bit dangerous,,to draw parallels between humans and animals.,So that's it.,DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.,Thank you, Nicolas Perony.Right now,there is an aspiring teacher,who is working on a 60-page paper,based on some age-old education theory,developed by some dead education professor,wondering to herself what this task,that she's engaging in,has to do with what she wants to do with her life,,which is be an educator,,change lives, and spark magic.,Right now there is an aspiring teacher,in a graduate school of education,who is watching a professor babble on and on,about engagement,in the most disengaging way possible.,Right now,there's a first-year teacher at home,who is pouring through lesson plans,trying to make sense of standards,,who is trying to make sense of hownto grade students appropriately,,while at the same time saying to herself,over and over again,,"Don't smile till November,",because that's what she was taught,in her teacher education program.,Right now there's a student,who is coming up with a way,to convince his mom or dad,that he's very, very sick,and can't make it to school tomorrow.,On the other hand, right now,there are amazing educators,that are sharing information,,information that is shared in such a beautiful way,that the students are sittingnat the edge of their seats,just waiting for a bead of sweat,to drop off the face of this person,so they can soak up all that knowledge.,Right now there is also a person,who has an entire audience rapt with attention,,a person that is weaving a powerful narrative,about a world,that the people who are listening,have never imagined or seen before,,but if they close their eyes tightly enough,,they can envision that world,because the storytelling is so compelling.,Right now there's a person who can tell an audience,to put their hands up in the air,and they will stay there till he says,,"Put them down.",Right now. 
 So people will then say,,"Well, Chris, you describe the guy,who is going through some awful training,but you're also describing these powerful educators.,If you're thinking about the world of education,or urban education in particular,,these guys will probably cancel each other out,,and then we'll be okay." 
 The reality is, the folks I described,as the master teachers,,the master narrative builders,,the master storytellers,are far removed from classrooms.,The folks who know the skills about how to teach,and engage an audience,don't even know what teacher certification means.,They may not even have the degrees,to be able to have anything,to call an education.,And that to me is sad.,It's sad because the people who I described,,they were very disinterested in the learning process,,want to be effective teachers,,but they have no models.,I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.,Mark Twain says that proper preparation,,or teaching,,is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,,it can turn awful practices into powerful ones,,it can change men and transform them,into angels. 
 The folks who I described earlier,got proper preparation in teaching,,not in any college or university,,but by virtue of just being in thensame spaces of those who engage.,Guess where those places are?,Barber shops,,rap concerts, and most importantly,,in the black church.,And I've been framing this ideancalled Pentecostal pedagogy.,Who here has been to a black church?,We got a couple of hands.,You go to a black church,,their preacher starts off,and he realizes that he has to engage the audience,,so he starts off with this sort of wordplay,in the beginning oftentimes,,and then he takes a pause,,and he says, "Oh my gosh, they'rennot quite paying attention.",So he says, "Can I get an amen?" 
 Audience: Amen. 
 Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen?nAudience: Amen. 
 CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.,That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.,He drops his voice at a very, very low volume,when he wants people to key into him,,and those things are the skills that we need,for the most engaging teachers.,So why does teacher education,only give you theory and theory,and tell you about standards and tell you about,all of these things that have nothing to do,with the basic skills, that magic that you need,to engage an audience, to engage a student?,So I make the argument thatnwe reframe teacher education,,that we could focus on content, and that's fine,,and we could focus on theories, and that's fine,,but content and theories,with the absence of the magic,of teaching and learning means nothing. 
 Now people oftentimes say,n"Well, magic is just magic.",There are teachers who,,despite all their challenges, who have those skills,,get into those schools and are nable to engage an audience,,and the administrator walks by and says,,"Wow, he's so good, I wish allnmy teachers could be that good.",And when they try to describe what that is,,they just say, "He has that magic." 
 But I'm here to tell you,that magic can be taught.,Magic can be taught.,Magic can be taught.,Now, how do you teach it?,You teach it by allowing people,to go into those spaces,where the magic is happening.,If you want to be an aspiringnteacher in urban education,,you've got to leave the confines of that university,and go into the hood.,You've got to go in there andnhang out at the barbershop,,you've got to attend that black church,,and you've got to view those folks,that have the power to engage,and just take notes on what they do.,At our teacher education classes at my university,,I've started a project where every single student,that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.,They watch the way that the rappers move,and talk with their hands.,They study the way that henwalks proudly across that stage.,They listen to his metaphors and analogies,,and they start learning these little things,that if they practice enough,becomes the key to magic.,They learn that if you just stare at a student,and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,,you don't have to say a word,because they know that thatnmeans that you want more.,And if we could transform teacher education,to focus on teaching teachers,how to create that magic,then poof! we could make dead classes come alive,,we could reignite imaginations,,and we can change education. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a lot of ones and zeros.,It's what we call binary information.,This is how computers talk.,It's how they store information.,It's how computers think.,It's how computers do,everything it is that computers do.,I'm a cybersecurity researcher,,which means my job is to sitndown with this information,and try to make sense of it,,to try to understand what allnthe ones and zeroes mean.,Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking,about the ones and zerosnI have on the screen here.,We're not just talking about anfew pages of ones and zeros.,We're talking about billions and billions,of ones and zeros,,more than anyone could possibly comprehend. 
 Now, as exciting as that sounds,,when I first started doing cyber —,(Laughter) —,when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure,that sifting through ones and zeros,was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,,because in my mind, cyber,was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,,it was keeping people's Myspacenpages from being hacked,,and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,,it was keeping someone's creditncard information from being stolen.,Those are important things,,but that's not how I wanted to spend my life. 
 But after 30 minutes of work,as a defense contractor,,I soon found out that my idea of cyber,was a little bit off.,In fact, in terms of national security,,keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,was surprisingly low on their priority list.,And the reason for that is cyber,is so much bigger than any one of those things.,Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives,,because computers are annintegral part of all of our lives,,even if you don't own a computer.,Computers control everything in your car,,from your GPS to your airbags.,They control your phone.,They're the reason you can call 911,and get someone on the other line.,They control our nation's entire infrastructure.,They're the reason you have electricity,,heat, clean water, food.,Computers control our military equipment,,everything from missile silos to satellites,to nuclear defense networks.,All of these things are made possible,because of computers,,and therefore because of cyber,,and when something goes wrong,,cyber can make all of these things impossible. 
 But that's where I step in.,A big part of my job is defending all of these things,,keeping them working,,but once in a while, part of mynjob is to break one of these things,,because cyber isn't just about defense,,it's also about offense.,We're entering an age where we talk about,cyberweapons.,In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense,that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.,Warfare.,It's not necessarily a bad thing.,On the one hand, it means we have whole new front,on which we need to defend ourselves,,but on the other hand,,it means we have a whole new way to attack,,a whole new way to stop evil people,from doing evil things. 
 So let's consider an example of this,that's completely theoretical.,Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,,and he wants to do this again and again,in the future.,So he doesn't want to be innthat building when it explodes.,He's going to use a cell phone,as a remote detonator.,Now, it used to be the only way we had,to stop this terrorist,was with a hail of bullets and a car chase,,but that's not necessarily true anymore.,We're entering an age where we can stop him,with the press of a button,from 1,000 miles away,,because whether he knew it or not,,as soon as he decided to use his cell phone,,he stepped into the realm of cyber.,A well-crafted cyber attackncould break into his phone,,disable the overvoltage protections on his battery,,drastically overload the circuit,,cause the battery to overheat, and explode.,No more phone, no more detonator,,maybe no more terrorist,,all with the press of a button,from a thousand miles away. 
 So how does this work?,It all comes back to those ones and zeros.,Binary information makes your phone work,,and used correctly, it can make your phone explode.,So when you start to look atncyber from this perspective,,spending your life sifting through binary information,starts to seem kind of exciting. 
 But here's the catch: This is hard,,really, really hard,,and here's why.,Think about everything you have on your cell phone.,You've got the pictures you've taken.,You've got the music you listen to.,You've got your contacts list,,your email, and probably 500 apps,you've never used in your entire life,,and behind all of this is the software, the code,,that controls your phone,,and somewhere, buried inside of that code,,is a tiny piece that controls your battery,,and that's what I'm really after,,but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,,and it's all just mixed together.,In cyber, we call this finding anneedle in a stack of needles,,because everything pretty much looks alike.,I'm looking for one key piece,,but it just blends in with everything else. 
 So let's step back from this theoretical situation,of making a terrorist's phone explode,,and look at something that actually happened to me.,Pretty much no matter what I do,,my job always starts with sitting down,with a whole bunch of binary information,,and I'm always looking for one key piece,to do something specific.,In this case, I was looking for a very advanced,,very high-tech piece of code,that I knew I could hack,,but it was somewhere buried,inside of a billion ones and zeroes.,Unfortunately for me, I didn't know,quite what I was looking for.,I didn't know quite what it would look like,,which makes finding it really, really hard.,When I have to do that, what I have to do,is basically look at various pieces,of this binary information,,try to decipher each piece, and see if it might be,what I'm after.,So after a while, I thought I had found the piece,I was looking for.,I thought maybe this was it.,It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.,I couldn't tell what thosenones and zeros represented.,So I spent some time trying to put this together,,but wasn't having a whole lot of luck,,and finally I decided,,I'm going to get through this,,I'm going to come in on a weekend,,and I'm not going to leave,until I figure out what this represents.,So that's what I did. I camenin on a Saturday morning,,and about 10 hours in, I sort ofnhad all the pieces to the puzzle.,I just didn't know how they fit together.,I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.,At the 15-hour mark,,I started to get a better picture of what was there,,but I had a creeping suspicion,that what I was looking at,was not at all related to what I was looking for.,By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together,very slowly — (Laughter) —,and I was pretty sure I was going down,the wrong path at this point,,but I wasn't going to give up.,After 30 hours in the lab,,I figured out exactly what I was looking at,,and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.,I spent 30 hours piecing together,the ones and zeros thatnformed a picture of a kitten.,(Laughter),I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten,that had nothing at all to do,with what I was trying to accomplish. 
 So I was frustrated, I was exhausted.,After 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.,But instead of just going home,and calling it quits, I took a step back,and asked myself, what went wrong here?,How could I make such a stupid mistake?,I'm really pretty good at this.,I do this for a living.,So what happened?,Well I thought, when you'renlooking at information at this level,,it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.,It's easy to not see the forest through the trees.,It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole,and waste a tremendous amount of time,doing the wrong thing.,But I had this epiphany.,We were looking at the data completely incorrectly,since day one.,This is how computers think, ones and zeros.,It's not how people think,,but we've been trying to adapt our minds,to think more like computers,so that we can understand this information.,Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,,we should have been making the problem,fit our minds,,because our brains have a tremendous potential,for analyzing huge amounts of information,,just not like this.,So what if we could unlock that potential,just by translating this,to the right kind of information?,So with these ideas in mind,,I sprinted out of my basement lab at work,to my basement lab at home,,which looked pretty much the same.,The main difference is, at work,,I'm surrounded by cyber materials,,and cyber seemed to be thenproblem in this situation.,At home, I'm surrounded byneverything else I've ever learned.,So I poured through every book I could find,,every idea I'd ever encountered,,to see how could we translate a problem,from one domain to something completely different? 
 The biggest question was,,what do we want to translate it to?,What do our brains do perfectly naturally,that we could exploit?,My answer was vision.,We have a tremendous capabilitynto analyze visual information.,We can combine color gradients, depth cues,,all sorts of these different signals,into one coherent picture of the world around us.,That's incredible.,So if we could find a way to translate,these binary patterns to visual signals,,we could really unlock the power of our brains,to process this stuff.,So I started looking at the binary information,,and I asked myself, what do I do,when I first encounter something like this?,And the very first thing I want to do,,the very first question I want to answer,,is what is this?,I don't care what it does, how it works.,All I want to know is, what is this?,And the way I can figure that out,is by looking at chunks,,sequential chunks of binary information,,and I look at the relationshipsnbetween those chunks.,When I gather up enough of these sequences,,I begin to get an idea of exactly,what this information must be.,So let's go back to that,blow up the terrorist's phone situation.,This is what English text looks like,at a binary level.,This is what your contacts list would look like,if I were examining it.,It's really hard to analyze this at this level,,but if we take those same binary chunks,that I would be trying to find,,and instead translate that,to a visual representation,,translate those relationships,,this is what we get.,This is what English text looks like,from a visual abstraction perspective.,All of a sudden,,it shows us all the same information,that was in the ones and zeros,,but show us it in an entirely different way,,a way that we can immediately comprehend.,We can instantly see all of the patterns here.,It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,,but hours, days, to pick them out,in ones and zeros.,It takes minutes for anybody to learn,what these patterns represent here,,but years of experience in cyber,to learn what those same patterns represent,in ones and zeros.,So this piece is caused by,lower case letters followed by lower case letters,inside of that contact list.,This is upper case by upper case,,upper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.,This is caused by spaces. Thisnis caused by carriage returns.,We can go through every little detail,of the binary information in seconds,,as opposed to weeks, months, at this level.,This is what an image looks like,from your cell phone.,But this is what it looks like,in a visual abstraction.,This is what your music looks like,,but here's its visual abstraction.,Most importantly for me,,this is what the code on your cell phone looks like.,This is what I'm after in the end,,but this is its visual abstraction.,If I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.,I could spend weeks trying to find this,in ones and zeros,,but it takes me seconds to pick out,a visual abstraction like this. 
 One of those most remarkable parts about all of this,is it gives us an entirely new way to understand,new information, stuff that we haven't seen before.,So I know what English looks like at a binary level,,and I know what its visual abstraction looks like,,but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.,It would take me weeks just to figure out,what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,,but because our brains can instantly pick up,and recognize these subtle patterns inside,of these visual abstractions,,we can unconsciously apply those,in new situations.,So this is what Russian looks like,in a visual abstraction.,Because I know what one language looks like,,I can recognize other languages,even when I'm not familiar with them.,This is what a photograph looks like,,but this is what clip art looks like.,This is what the code on your phone looks like,,but this is what the code onnyour computer looks like.,Our brains can pick up on these patterns,in ways that we never could have,from looking at raw ones and zeros.,But we've really only scratched the surface,of what we can do with this approach.,We've only begun to unlock the capabilities,of our minds to process visual information.,If we take those same concepts and translate them,into three dimensions instead,,we find entirely new ways ofnmaking sense of information.,In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.,we can see the cross associated with code.,We can see cubes associated with text.,We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.,Things that would take us weeks,,months to find in ones and zeroes,,are immediately apparent,in some sort of visual abstraction,,and as we continue to go through this,and throw more and more information at it,,what we find is that we're capable of processing,billions of ones and zeros,in a matter of seconds,just by using our brain's built-in ability,to analyze patterns. 
 So this is really nice and helpful,,but all this tells me is what I'm looking at.,So at this point, based on visual patterns,,I can find the code on the phone.,But that's not enough to blow up a battery.,The next thing I need to find is the code,that controls the battery, but we're back,to the needle in a stack of needles problem.,That code looks pretty much like all the other code,on that system. 
 So I might not be able to find thencode that controls the battery,,but there's a lot of thingsnthat are very similar to that.,You have code that controls your screen,,that controls your buttons,nthat controls your microphones,,so even if I can't find the code for the battery,,I bet I can find one of those things.,So the next step in my binary analysis process,is to look at pieces of information,that are similar to each other.,It's really, really hard to do at a binary level,,but if we translate those similaritiesnto a visual abstraction instead,,I don't even have to sift through the raw data.,All I have to do is wait for the image to light up,to see when I'm at similar pieces.,I follow these strands of similaritynlike a trail of bread crumbs,to find exactly what I'm looking for. 
 So at this point in the process,,I've located the code,responsible for controlling your battery,,but that's still not enough to blow up a phone.,The last piece of the puzzle,is understanding how that code,controls your battery.,For this, I need to identify,very subtle, very detailed relationships,within that binary information,,another very hard thing to do,when looking at ones and zeros.,But if we translate that information,into a physical representation,,we can sit back and let ournvisual cortex do all the hard work.,It can find all the detailed patterns,,all the important pieces, for us.,It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code,work together to control that battery.,All of this can be done in a matter of hours,,whereas the same process,would have taken months in the past. 
 This is all well and good,in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.,I wanted to find out if this would really work,in the work I do every day.,So I was playing around with these same concepts,with some of the data I've looked at in the past,,and yet again, I was trying to find,a very detailed, specific piece of code,inside of a massive piece of binary information.,So I looked at it at this level,,thinking I was looking at the right thing,,only to see this doesn't have,the connectivity I would have expected,for the code I was looking for.,In fact, I'm not really sure what this is,,but when I stepped back a level,and looked at the similarities within the code,I saw, this doesn't have similarities,like any code that exists out there.,I can't even be looking at code.,In fact, from this perspective,,I could tell, this isn't code.,This is an image of some sort.,And from here, I can see,,it's not just an image, this is a photograph.,Now that I know it's a photograph,,I've got dozens of othernbinary translation techniques,to visualize and understand that information,,so in a matter of seconds,nwe can take this information,,shove it through a dozen othernvisual translation techniques,in order to find out exactly what we were looking at.,I saw — (Laughter) —,it was that darn kitten again.,All this is enabled,because we were able to find a way,to translate a very hard problem,to something our brains do very naturally. 
 So what does this mean?,Well, for kittens, it means,no more hiding in ones and zeros.,For me, it means no more wasted weekends.,For cyber, it means we have a radical new way,to tackle the most impossible problems.,It means we have a new weapon,in the evolving theater of cyber warfare,,but for all of us,,it means that cyber engineers,now have the ability to become first responders,in emergency situations.,When seconds count,,we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The entire model of capitalism,and the economic model that you and I,did business in,,and, in fact, continue to do business in,,was built around what probably Milton Friedman,put more succinctly.,And Adam Smith, of course, nthe father of modern economics,actually said many, many years ago,,the invisible hand,,which is, "If you continue to operate,in your own self-interest,you will do the best good for society." 
 Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things,and I've talked about a lot of good nthings that have happened,,but equally, it has not been able to meet up,with some of the challenges that we've seen,in society.,The model that at least I was brought up in,and a lot of us doingnbusiness were brought up in,was one which talked about,what I call the three G's of growth:,growth that is consistent,,quarter on quarter;,growth that is competitive,,better than the other person;,and growth that is profitable,,so you continue to make,more and more shareholder value.,And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough,and we have to move from this 3G model,to a model of what I call,the fourth G:,the G of growth that is responsible.,And it is this that has to become,a very important part,of creating value.,Of not just creating economic value,but creating social value.,And companies that will thrive are those,that will actually embrace the fourth G.,And the model of 4G is quite simple:,Companies cannot afford nto be just innocent bystanders,in what's happening around in society.,They have to begin to play their role,in terms of serving the communities,which actually sustain them.,And we have to move to a model,of an and/and model which is,how do we make money and do good?,How do we make sure,that we have a great business,but we also have a great environment around us?,And that model,is all about doing well and doing good. 
 But the question is easier said than done.,But how do we actually get that done?,And I do believe,that the answer to that is going to be leadership.,It is going to be to redefine,the new business models,which understand,that the only license to operate,is to combine these things.,And for that you need businesses,that can actually define their role,in society,in terms of a much larger purpose,than the products and brands that they sell.,And companies that actually define a true north,,things that are nonnegotiable,whether times are good, bad, ugly --,doesn't matter.,There are things that you stand for.,Values and purpose are going to be the two,drivers of software,that are going to create,the companies of tomorrow. 
 And I'm going to now shift,to talking a little bit about my own experiences.,I joined Unilever in 1976,as a management trainee in India.,And on my first day of work,I walked in and my boss tells me,,"Do you know why you're here?",I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap.",And he said, n"No, you're here to change lives.",You're here to change lives.,You know, I thought it was rather facetious.,We are a company that sells soap and soup.,What are we doing about changing lives?,And it's then I realized,that simple acts,like selling a bar of soap,can save more lives,than pharmaceutical companies.,I don't know how many of you know,that five million children don't reach the age of five,because of simple infections that can be prevented,by an act of washing their hands with soap. 
 We run the largest,hand-washing program,in the world.,We are running a program on hygiene and health,that now touches half a billion people.,It's not about selling soap,,there is a larger purpose out there.,And brands indeed can be,at the forefront of social change.,And the reason for that is,,when two billion people use your brands,that's the amplifier.,Small actions can make a big difference. 
 Take another example,,I was walking around in none of our villages in India.,Now those of you who have done this,will realize that this is no walk in the park.,And we had this lady,who was one of our small distributors --,beautiful, very, very modest, her home --,and she was out there,,dressed nicely,,her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind,and her sister-in-law behind her.,The social order was changing,because this lady,is part of our Project Shakti,that is actually teaching women,how to do small business,and how to carry the message,of nutrition and hygiene.,We have 60,000 such women,now in India. 
 It's not about selling soap,,it's about making sure,that in the process of doing so,you can change people's lives.,Small actions, big difference. 
 Our R&D folks,are not only working to give us nsome fantastic detergents,,but they're working to make sure we use less water.,A product that we've just launched recently,,One Rinse product that allows you to save water,every time you wash your clothes.,And if we can convert all our users to using this,,that's 500 billion liters of water.,By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water,for a whole huge continent.,So just think about it.,There are small actions that ncan make a big difference. 
 And I can go on and on.,Our food chain, our brilliant products --,and I'm sorry I'm giving you na word from the sponsors --,Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.,We are committed to making sure that,all our agricultural raw materials,are sourced from sustainable sources,,100-percent sustainable sources. 
 We were the first,to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil,from sustainable sources.,I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,,and not buying it from sustainable sources,,can create deforestation that is responsible,for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.,We were the first to embrace that,,and it's all because we market soap and soup.,And the point I'm making here,is that companies like yours, companies like mine,have to define a purpose,which embraces responsibility,and understands that we have to play our part,in the communities in which we operate. 
 We introduced something called,The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,,"Our purpose is to make nsustainable living commonplace,,and we are gong to change the lives,of one billion people over 2020.",Now the question here is,,where do we go from here?,And the answer to that is very simple:,We're not going to change the world alone.,There are plenty of you and plenty of us,who understand this.,The question is,,we need partnerships, we need coalitions,and importantly, we need that leadership,that will allow us to take this from here,and to be the change,that we want to see around us.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical,,and I returned to the medical university,where I studied.,I saw real patients and I wore the white coat,for the first time in 17 years,,in fact since I became a management consultant. 
 There were two things that surprised me,during the month I spent.,The first one was that the common theme,of the discussions we had were hospital budgets,and cost-cutting,,and the second thing, which really bothered me,,actually, was that several of the colleagues I met,,former friends from medical school,,who I knew to be some of the smartest,,most motivated, engaged and passionate people,I'd ever met,,many of them had turned cynical, disengaged,,or had distanced themselvesnfrom hospital management.,So with this focus on cost-cutting,,I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient? 
 Many countries that you represent,and where I come from,struggle with the cost of healthcare.,It's a big part of the national budgets.,And many different reforms aimnat holding back this growth.,In some countries, we have long waiting times,for patients for surgery.,In other countries, new drugsnare not being reimbursed,,and therefore don't reach patients.,In several countries, doctors and nurses,are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.,After all, the costly decisions in health care,are taken by doctors and nurses.,You choose an expensive lab test,,you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.,So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,,this is a way to hold costs down.,And ultimately, some physicians will say today,that they don't have the full liberty,to make the choices they thinknare right for their patients.,So no wonder that some of my old colleagues,are frustrated. 
 At BCG, we looked at this,,and we asked ourselves,,this can't be the right way of managing healthcare.,And so we took a step back and we said,,"What is it that we are trying to achieve?",Ultimately, in the healthcare system,,we're aiming at improving health for the patients,,and we need to do so at a limited,,or affordable, cost.,We call this value-based healthcare.,On the screen behind me, you see what we mean,by value:,outcomes that matter to patients,relative to the money we spend.,This was described beautifully in a book in 2006,by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg. 
 On this picture, you have my father-in-law,surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.,When we started doing our research at BCG,,we decided not to look so much at the costs,,but to look at the quality instead,,and in the research, one of the things,that fascinated us was the variation we saw.,You compare hospitals in a country,,you'll find some that are extremely good,,but you'll find a large numbernthat are vastly much worse.,The differences were dramatic.,Erik, my father-in-law,,he suffers from prostate cancer,,and he probably needs surgery.,Now living in Europe, he cannchoose to go to Germany,that has a well-reputed healthcare system.,If he goes there and goes to the average hospital,,he will have the risk of becoming incontinent,by about 50 percent,,so he would have to start wearing diapers again.,You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.,If he instead would go to Hamburg,,and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,,the risk would be only one in 20.,Either you a flip a coin,,or you have a one in 20 risk.,That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.,When we look at many hospitals,for many different diseases,,we see these huge differences. 
 But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.,And often, the data actually doesn't exist.,Nobody knows.,So going the hospital is a lottery. 
 Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.,In the late '70s, there were a group,of Swedish orthopedic surgeons,who met at their annual meeting,,and they were discussing the different procedures,they used to operate hip surgery.,To the left of this slide, you see a variety,of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use,for somebody who needs a new hip.,They all realized they hadntheir individual way of operating.,They all argued that, "My technique is the best,",but none of them actually knew,nand they admitted that.,So they said, "We probably need to measure quality,so we know and can learn from what's best.",So they in fact spent two years debating,,"So what is quality in hip surgery?","Oh, we should measure this."n"No, we should measure that.",And they finally agreed.,And once they had agreed, they started measuring,,and started sharing the data.,Very quickly, they found that if you put cement,in the bone of the patient,before you put the metal shaft in,,it actually lasted a lot longer,,and most patients would never have to be,re-operated on in their lifetime.,They published the data,,and it actually transformednclinical practice in the country.,Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.,Since then, they publish every year.,Once a year, they publish the league table:,who's best, who's at the bottom?,And they visit each other to try to learn,,so a continuous cycle of improvement.,For many years, Swedish hip surgeons,had the best results in the world,,at least for those who actually were measuring,,and many were not. 
 Now I found this principle really exciting.,So the physicians get together,,they agree on what quality is,,they start measuring, they share the data,,they find who's best, and they learn from it.,Continuous improvement. 
 Now, that's not the only exciting part.,That's exciting in itself.,But if you bring back the cost side of the equation,,and look at that,,it turns out, those who have focused on quality,,they actually also have the lowest costs,,although that's not been the purposenin the first place.,So if you look at the hip surgery story again,,there was a study done a couple years ago,where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.,They looked at how many patients have needed,to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.,In the United States, the number was three times,higher than in Sweden.,So many unnecessary surgeries,,and so much unnecessary suffering,for all the patients who were operated on,in that seven year period.,Now, you can imagine how much savings,there would be for society. 
 We did a study where we looked at OECD data.,OECD does, every so often,,look at quality of care,where they can find the datanacross the member countries.,The United States has, for many diseases,,actually a quality which is below the average,in OECD.,Now, if the American healthcare system,would focus a lot more on measuring quality,,and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,,it would save the American people,500 billion U.S. dollars a year.,That's 20 percent of the budget,,of the healthcare budget of the country. 
 Now you may say that these numbers,are fantastic, and it's all logical,,but is it possible?,This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,,and I would argue that not only can it be done,,but it has to be done.,The agents of change are the doctors and nurses,in the healthcare system. 
 In my practice as a consultant,,I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred,doctors and nurses and other hospital,or healthcare staff every year.,The one thing they have in common is,they really care about what they achieve,in terms of quality for their patients.,Physicians are, like most of you in the audience,,very competitive.,They were always best in class.,We were always best in class.,And if somebody can show them that the result,they perform for their patients,is no better than what others do,,they will do whatever it takes to improve.,But most of them don't know.,But physicians have another characteristic.,They actually thrive from peer recognition.,If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist,in a competing hospital,and discusses why that other hospital,has so much better results, they will share.,They will share the information on how to improve.,So it is, by measuring and creating transparency,,you get a cycle of continuous improvement,,which is what this slide shows. 
 Now, you may say this is a nice idea,,but this isn't only an idea.,This is happening in reality.,We're creating a global community,,and a large global community,,where we'll be able to measure and compare,what we achieve.,Together with two academic institutions,,Michael Porter at Harvard Business School,,and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,,BCG has formed something we call ICHOM.,You may think that's a sneeze,,but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.,It stands for the International Consortium,for Health Outcome Measurement.,We're bringing together leading physicians,and patients to discuss, disease by disease,,what is really quality,,what should we measure,,and to make those standards global.,They've worked -- four working groups have worked,during the past year:,cataracts, back pain,,coronary artery disease, which is,nfor instance, heart attack,,and prostate cancer.,The four groups will publish their data,in November of this year.,That's the first time we'll be comparing,apples to apples, not only within a country,,but between countries.,Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases,,the year after, 16.,In three years' time, we plan to have covered,40 percent of the disease burden.,Compare apples to apples. Who's better?,Why is that? 
 Five months ago,,I led a workshop at the largest university hospital,in Northern Europe.,They have a new CEO, and she has a vision:,I want to manage my big institution much more,on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.,This particular day, we sat in a workshop,together with physicians, nurses and other staff,,discussing leukemia in children.,The group discussed,,how do we measure quality today?,Can we measure it better than we do?,We discussed, how do we treat these kids,,what are important improvements?,And we discussed what arenthe costs for these patients,,can we do treatment more efficiently?,There was an enormous energy in the room.,There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.,At the end of the meeting,,the chairman of the department, he stood up.,He looked over the group and he said --,first he raised his hand, I forgot that --,he raised his hand, clenched his fist,,and then he said to the group, "Thank you.,Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing,what this hospital does the right way." 
 By measuring value in healthcare,,that is not only costs,but outcomes that matter to patients,,we will make staff in hospitals,and elsewhere in the healthcare system,not a problem but an important part of the solution.,I believe measuring value in healthcare,will bring about a revolution,,and I'm convinced that the founder,of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,,who always put the patient at the center,,he would smile in his grave. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, stepping down out of the bus,,I headed back to the corner,to head west en route to a braille training session.,It was the winter of 2009,,and I had been blind for about a year.,Things were going pretty well.,Safely reaching the other side,,I turned to the left,,pushed the auto-button fornthe audible pedestrian signal,,and waited my turn.,As it went off, I took off,and safely got to the other side.,Stepping onto the sidewalk,,I then heard the sound of a steel chair,slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.,I know there's a cafe on the corner,,and they have chairs out in front,,so I just adjusted to the left,to get closer to the street.,As I did, so slid the chair.,I just figured I'd made a mistake,,and went back to the right,,and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.,Now I was getting a little anxious.,I went back to the left,,and so slid the chair,,blocking my path of travel.,Now, I was officially freaking out.,So I yelled,,"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?",Just then, over my shout,,I heard something else, a familiar rattle.,It sounded familiar,,and I quickly considered another possibility,,and I reached out with my left hand,,as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,,and I came across an ear,,the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.,Its leash had been tied to the chair,as her master went in for coffee,,and she was just persistent in her efforts,to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.,Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.,(Laughter) 
 But that little story is really about,the fears and misconceptions that come along,with the idea of moving through the city,without sight,,seemingly oblivious to the environment,and the people around you. 
 So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.,On St. Patrick's Day of 2008,,I reported to the hospital for surgery,to remove a brain tumor.,The surgery was successful.,Two days later, my sight started to fail.,On the third day, it was gone. 
 Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense,of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,,like anybody would.,But as I had time to stop and think,,I actually started to realize,I had a lot to be grateful for.,In particular, I thought about my dad,,who had passed away from complications,from brain surgery.,He was 36. I was seven at the time.,So although I had every reason,to be fearful of what was ahead,,and had no clue quite what was going to happen,,I was alive.,My son still had his dad.,And besides, it's not like I was the first person,ever to lose their sight.,I knew there had to be all sorts of systems,and techniques and training to have,to live a full and meaningful, active life,without sight. 
 So by the time I was discharged from the hospital,a few days later, I left with a mission,,a mission to get out and get the best training,as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.,Within six months, I had returned to work.,My training had started.,I even started riding a tandem bike,with my old cycling buddies,,and was commuting to work on my own,,walking through town and taking the bus.,It was a lot of hard work. 
 But what I didn't anticipate,through that rapid transition,was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition,of my sighted experiencenup against my unsighted experience,of the same places and the same people,within such a short period of time. 
 From that came a lot of insights,,or outsights, as I called them,,things that I learned since losing my sight.,These outsights ranged from the trival,to the profound,,from the mundane to the humorous.,As an architect, that stark juxtaposition,of my sighted and unsighted experience,of the same places and the same cities,within such a short period of time,has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights,of the city itself.,Paramount amongst those,was the realization that, actually,,cities are fantastic places for the blind.,And then I was also surprised,by the city's propensity for kindness and care,as opposed to indifference or worse.,And then I started to realize that,it seemed like the blind seemed to have,a positive influence on the city itself.,That was a little curious to me. 
 Let me step back and take a look,at why the city is so good for the blind.,Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss,is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,,things that you would otherwise maybe ignore.,It's like a whole new world of sensory information,opens up to you.,I was really struck by the symphony,of subtle sounds all around me in the city,that you can hear and work with,to understand where you are,,how you need to move, and where you need to go.,Similarly, just through the grip of the cane,,you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,,and over time you build a pattern of where you are,and where you're headed.,Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face,or the wind at your neck,gives you clues about your alignment,and your progression through a block,and your movement through time and space.,But also, the sense of smell.,Some districts and cities have their own smell,,as do places and things around you,,and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose,to that new bakery that you've been looking for. 
 All this really surprised me,,because I started to realize that,my unsighted experienced,was so far more multi-sensory,than my sighted experience ever was.,What struck me also was how much the city,was changing around me.,When you're sighted,,everybody kind of sticks to themselves,,you mind your own business.,Lose your sight, though,,and it's a whole other story.,And I don't know who's watching who,,but I have a suspicion thatna lot of people are watching me.,And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,,I'm getting all sorts of advice:,Go here, move there, watch out for this.,A lot of the information is good.,Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.,You've got to figure out what they actually meant.,Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.,But it's all good in the grand scheme of things. 
 But one time I was in Oakland,walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.,I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,,and as it went off, I was just aboutnto step out into the street,,when all of a sudden, my right hand,was just gripped by this guy,,and he yanked my armnand pulled me out into the crosswalk,and was dragging me out across the street,,speaking to me in Mandarin.,(Laughter),It's like, there was no escapenfrom this man's death grip,,but he got me safely there.,What could I do?,But believe me, there are more polite ways,to offer assistance.,We don't know you're there,,so it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.,"Would you like some help?" 
 But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by,how much the city of Oakland changed,as I lost my sight.,I liked it sighted. It was fine.,It's a perfectly great city.,But once I lost my sight,and was walking along Broadway,,I was blessed every block of the way. 
 "Bless you, man." 
 "Go for it, brother." 
 "God bless you." 
 I didn't get that sighted.,(Laughter),And even without sight,nI don't get that in San Francisco.,And I know it bothers some of my blind friends,,it's not just me.,Often it's thought that,that's an emotion that comes up out of pity.,I tend to think that it comesnout of our shared humanity,,out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.,In fact, if I'm feeling down,,I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,,I go for a walk, and I feel better like that,,in no time at all. 
 But also that it illustrates how,disability and blindness,sort of cuts across ethnic, social,,racial, economic lines.,Disability is an equal-opportunity provider.,Everybody's welcome.,In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community,that there are really only two types of people:,There are those with disabilities,,and there are those that haven'tnquite found theirs yet.,It's a different way of thinking about it,,but I think it's kind of beautiful,,because it is certainly far more inclusive,than the us-versus-them,or the abled-versus-the-disabled,,and it's a lot more honest and respectful,of the fragility of life. 
 So my final takeaway for you is,that not only is the city good for the blind,,but the city needs us.,And I'm so sure of that that,I want to propose to you today,that the blind be taken asnthe prototypical city dwellers,when imagining new and wonderful cities,,and not the people that are thought about,after the mold has already been cast.,It's too late then.,So if you design a city with the blind in mind,,you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks,with a dense array of options and choices,all available at the street level.,If you design a city with the blind in mind,,sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.,The space between buildings will be well-balanced,between people and cars.,In fact, cars, who needs them?,If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter),They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter),If you design a city with the blind in mind,,you design a city with a robust,,accessible, well-connected mass transit system,that connects all parts of the city,and the region all around.,If you design a city with the blind in mind,,there'll be jobs, lots of jobs.,Blind people want to work too.,They want to earn a living. 
 So, in designing a city for the blind,,I hope you start to realize,that it actually would be a more inclusive,,a more equitable, a more just city for all.,And based on my prior sighted experience,,it sounds like a pretty cool city,,whether you're blind, whether you have a disability,,or you haven't quite found yours yet. 
 So thank you. 
 (Applause)By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child,for an American city in crisis.,There was a housing collapse,,an auto industry collapse,,and the population had plummeted by 25 percent,between 2000 and 2010,,and many people were beginning to write it off,,as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.,By 2010, I had also been asked by,the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit,to join them in leading a citywide planning process,for the city to create a shared vision for its future.,I come to this work,as an architect and an urban planner,,and I've spent my career workingnin other contested cities,,like Chicago, my hometown;,Harlem, which is my current home;,Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.,All of these cities, to me, still had a number,of unresolved issues related to urban justice,,issues of equity, inclusion and access. 
 Now by 2010, as well,,popular design magazines were also beginning,to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,,and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city.",I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,,to do an interview for the October issue,of Architect magazine,,and he and I kind of had a good chuckle,when we saw the magazine released with the title,,"Can This Planner Save Detroit?",So I'm smiling with a little bitnof embarrassment right now,,because obviously, it's completely absurd,that a single person, let alone a planner,,could save a city.,But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented,a sense of hopefulness that our profession,could play a role in helping the city to think about,how it would recover from its severe crisis.,So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon,and tell you a little bit about our process,for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,,and I want to do that throughnthe voices of Detroiters. 
 So we began our process in September of 2010.,It's just after a special mayoral election,,and word has gotten out that there is going to be,this citywide planning process,,which brings a lot of anxiety and fears,among Detroiters.,We had planned to hold a numbernof community meetings in rooms like this,to introduce the planning process,,and people came out from all over the city,,including areas that were stable neighborhoods,,as well as areas that were beginning to see,a lot of vacancy.,And most of our audience was representative,of the 82 percent African-American population,in the city at that time.,So obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program,,and people line up to mics to ask questions.,Many of them step very firmly to the mic,,put their hands across their chest, and go,,"I know you people are trying tonmove me out of my house, right?" 
 So that question is really powerful,,and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,,when you connect it to the stories,that some Detroiters had,,and actually a lot of African-Americans',families have had,that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.,Many of them told us the stories about,how they came to own their home,through their grandparents or great-grandparents,,who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated,from the rural South to the industrial North,,as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,,"The Great Migration.",They came to Detroit for a better way of life.,Many found work in the automobile industry,,the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural,by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.,The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,,for many the first piece of propertynthat they would ever know,,and a community with other first-time,African-American home buyers.,The first couple of decades of their life in the North,is quite well, up until about 1950,,which coincides with the city's peak population,at 1.8 million people.,Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see,a second kind of migration,,a migration to the suburbs.,Between 1950 and 2000,,the region grows by 30 percent.,But this time, the migration leaves,African-Americans in place,,as families and businesses flee the city,,leaving the city pretty desolate of people,as well as jobs.,During that same period, betweenn1950 and 2000, 2010,,the city loses 60 percent of its population,,and today it hovers at above 700,000. 
 The audience members who comenand talk to us that night,tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city,with such depleted population.,Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes,on their block that are occupied,,and that they can see several abandoned homes,from where they sit on their porches.,Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.,They can also see vacant property.,They're beginning to see illegal activities,on these properties, like illegal dumping,,and they know that because the citynhas lost so much population,,their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,,because there are not enough peoplento pay property taxes,to help support the services that they need.,Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels. 
 Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,,because I know that sounds like a big number,,but I don't think you quite understandnuntil you look at the city map.,So the city is 139 square miles.,You can fit Boston, San Francisco,,and the island of Manhattan,within its footprint.,So if we take all of that vacantnand abandoned property,and we smush it together,,it looks like about 20 square miles,,and that's roughly equivalent to the size,of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,,at 22 square miles.,So it's a lot of vacancy. 
 Now some of our audience members,also tell us about some of the positive things,that are happening in their communities,,and many of them are banding together,to take control of some of the vacant lots,,and they're starting community gardens,,which are creating a great sensenof community stewardship,,but they're very, very clear to tell us,that this is not enough,,that they want to see their neighborhoods,return to the way that theirngrandparents had found them. 
 Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010,about what to do with the vacant property,,and a lot of that speculation hasnbeen around community gardening,,or what we call urban agriculture.,So many people would say to us,,"What if you just take all that vacant landnand you could make it farmland?,It can provide fresh foods,,and it can put Detroiters back to work too.",When I hear that story,,I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration,rolling over in their graves,,because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice,moving from the South to the North,to create a better life for their families,,only to see their great-grandchildrennreturn to an agrarian lifestyle,,especially in a city where they came,with little less than a high school education,or even a grammar school education,and were able to afford the basic elements,of the American dream:,steady work and a home that they owned. 
 Now, there's a third wave of migration,happening in Detroit:,a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.,These folks see that same vacant land,and those same abandoned homes,as opportunity for new,,entrepreneurial ideas and profit,,so much so that former models,can move to Detroit,,buy property, start successful,businesses and restaurants,,and become successful communitynactivists in their neighborhood,,bringing about very positive change.,Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies,making conscious decisions to relocate to the city.,This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch,and bicycle company,,deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,,and they quote themselves by saying,they were drawn to the global brand nof Detroit's innovation.,And they also knew that nthey can tap into a workforce,that was still very skilled in how to make things.,Now we have community stewardship,happening in neighborhoods,,we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions,to move to the city and create enterprises,,and we have businesses relocating,,and this is all in the context,of what is no secret to us all,,a city that's under the control,of an emergency manager,,and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 
 So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,,we released Detroit Future City,,which was our strategic plan to guide the city,into a better and more prosperous,and more sustainable existence --,not what it was, but what it could be,,looking at new ways of economic growth,,new forms of land use,,more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,,a reconfigured infrastructurenand city service system,,and a heightened capacity for civic leaders,to take action and implement change.,Three key imperatives were really important,to our work.,One was that the city itselfnwasn't necessarily too large,,but the economy was too small.,There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,,very different from a Denvernor an Atlanta or a Philadelphia,that are anywhere between n35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.,Secondly, there had to be an acceptance,that we were not going to be able to use,all of this vacant land in the way that we had before,and maybe for some time to come.,It wasn't going to be our traditionalnresidential neighborhoods,as we had before,,and urban agriculture, while a very productive,and successful intervention happening in Detroit,,was not the only answer,,that what we had to do is look at these areas,where we had significant vacancy,but still had a significant number of population,of what could be new, productive, innovative,,and entrepreneurial uses,that could stabilize those communities,,where still nearly 300,000 residents lived. 
 So we came up with one neighborhood typology --,there are several --ncalled a live-make neighborhood,,where folks could reappropriate,abandoned structures,and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,,with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,,majority 82 percent African-American population.,So they, too, could take businesses,that they maybe were doing out of their home,and grow them to more prosperous industries,and actually acquire property so they were actually,property owners as well as business owners,in the communities with which they resided.,Then we also wanted to look at other ways,of using land in addition to growing food,and transforming landscape into,much more productive uses,,so that it could be used for stormnwater management, for example,,by using surface lakes and retention ponds,,that created neighborhood amenities,,places of recreation,,and actually helped to elevate,adjacent property levels.,Or we could use it as research plots,,where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,,or we could use it to generate energy. 
 So the descendants of the Great Migration,could either become precisionnwatchmakers at Shinola,,like Willie H., who was featurednin one of their ads last year,,or they can actually grow a business,that would service companies like Shinola.,The good news is, there is a future,for the next generation of Detroiters,,both those there now and those that want to come. 
 So no thank you, Mayor Menino,,who recently was quoted as saying,,"I'd blow up the place and start over.",There are very important people,,business and land assets in Detroit,,and there are real opportunities there.,So while Detroit might not be what it was,,Detroit will not die. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Scientific breakthrough,,the kind that can potentially save lives,,can sometimes be lying right out in the open,for us to discover,,in the evolved, accumulated body,of human anecdote, for example,,or in the time-tested adaptations,that we observe in the natural world around us.,Science starts with observation,,but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures,that we might otherwise dismiss,as myth or coincidence,,isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.,And when we do, the results will often surprise. 
 Western Australia has had a particular problem,with shark attacks over the last three years,,unfortunately and tragically culminating,in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period,during that time.,But Western Australia is not alone in this.,The incident of shark engagements on humans,is escalating worldwide.,And so it's not surprising, perhaps,,that in July of this year,,Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration,with the University of WesternnAustralia Oceans Institute,made an announcement which captured the attention,of the worldwide media and of ocean users,worldwide,,and that was around the development of technology,to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack,based on the science of what sharks can see.,And I have for you today,the story of that journey,,but also the notion that science can be,as powerful as a translator,as it can be for invention. 
 When we began this process,,we were looking, it was about three years ago,,and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks,in Western Australia,,and by chance, in a previous role,,I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.,Now Harry Butler, who most Australiansnwould know is a famous naturalist,,had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.,Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,,to the late Steve Irwin.,When I asked him about,what the solution to the problem might be,,the answer was quite surprising.,He said, "Take a black wetsuit,,band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,,and you'll be mimicking the warning systems,of most marine species.",I didn't think about that much at the time,,and it wasn't until the next threenfatal shark attacks happened,,and it caused me to think,,maybe there's some merit to this idea.,And I turned to the web,to see if there might be some clues. 
 And it turns out the web is awash,with this sort of evidence that supports,this sort of thinking.,So biologically, there are plenty of species,that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,,to either be cryptical in the water,or warn against being attacked,,not the least of which is the pilot fish,which spends a big slab of its life,around the business end of a shark.,On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,,has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,,and anthropologically,,Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands,in a sea snake ceremony,to ward off the shark god. 
 So what's going on here?,Is this an idea lying wide out in the open,for us to consider and define?,We know that sharks use a range of sensors,when they engage, particularly for attack,,but the sight sensor is the one that they use,to identify the target, and particularly,in the last number of meters before the attack.,It makes sense to pay attentionnto the biological anecdote,because that's time-tested evolution,over many millennia.,But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,,the idea that there's a kernel of truth,thought to be important,,passed down from generation to generation,,so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior? 
 I wanted to test this idea.,I wanted to put some science,to this anecdotal evidence,,because if science could support this concept,,then we might have at least part of the solution,to shark attack right under our very nose.,To do that, I needed some experts,in shark vision and shark neurology,,and a worldwide search, again,,led to the University of W.A.,on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.,And professor Nathan Hart and his team,had just written a paper which tells us,,confirms that predatory sharks see,in black and white, or grayscale.,So I called up Nathan,,a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea,that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes,to produce a wetsuit to try andnmitigate the risk of shark attack,,and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.,So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research,supported by the West Australian State Government.,And we did three key things.,The first is that we mapped the characteristics,,the physical characteristics of the eyes,of the three main predatory sharks,,so the great white, tiger and bull shark.,We did that genetically,and we did that anatomically.,The next thing we did was to understand,,using complex computer modeling,,what that eye can see,at different depths, distances,,light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.,And from there, we were able to pinpoint,two key characteristics:,what patterns and shapes would present the wearer,as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,,and what patterns and shapes might provide,the greatest contrast but provide the greatest,breakup of profile,so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey,or shark food. 
 The next thing we needed to do was to convert this,into wetsuits that people might actually wear,,and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,,a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,,and in fact the guy that designednthe original Quiksilver logo,,to come over and sit with the science team,and interpret that science,into aesthetic wetsuits thatnpeople might actually wear.,And here's an example of one of the first drawings.,So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit.,So this takes that banding idea,,takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,,provides a highly disruptive profile,,and is intended to prevent the shark,from considering that you would be ordinary food,,and potentially even create confusion for the shark.,And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.,You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,,and it's particularly better for the surface,,where being backlit and providing a silhouette,is problematic.,Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,,or the one which attempts to hide the wearer,in the water column.,There are three panels on this suit,,and in any given conditions,,one or more of those panels,will match the reflective spectra of the water,so as to disappear fully or partially,,leaving the last panel or panels,to create a disruptive profile in the water column.,And this one's particularly well-suited,to the dive configuration,,so when you're deeper under the water. 
 So we knew that we had,some really solid science here.,We knew, if you wanted to stand out,,you needed to look stripy,,and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,,you needed to look like this.,But the acid test is always going to be,,how would sharks really behave,in the context of these patterns and shapes.,And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit,in the water with a predatory shark,in a natural environment,is actually a lot harder than you might think.,(Laughter) 
 So we have to bait the rig,,because we need to get the statistical number,of samples through to get the scientific evidence,,and by baiting the rig,,we're obviously changing shark behavior.,We can't put humans in the water.,We're ethically precluded from even using,humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.,But nevertheless, we started the testing process,in January of this year,,initially with tiger sharks,and subsequently with great white sharks.,The way we did that,was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,,wrap it in a neoprene skin,,and then run two stereo underwater cameras,to watch how the sharknactually engages with that rig.,And because we use stereo,,we can capture all the statisticsnon how big the shark is,,what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,,and what its behavior is,in an empirical rather than a subjective way.,Because we needed tonpreserve the scientific method,,we ran a control rig,which was a black neoprene rig,just like a normal black wetsuit,against the, what we call,,SAMS technology rig.,And the results were not just exciting,,but very encouraging,,and today I would like to just give you a snapshot,of two of those engagements. 
 So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark,engaging the black control rig,,which it had encountered about,a minute and a half before.,Now that exact same shark had engaged,,or encountered this SAMS rig,,which is the Elude SAMS rig,,about eight minutes before,,and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,,looking for what it couldnsmell and sense but not see,,and this was the final engagement.,Great white sharks are morenconfident than the tigers,,and here you see great white shark,engaging a control rig,,so a black neoprene wetsuit,,and going straight to the bottom,,coming up,and engaging.,In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,,this is the banded one,,where it's more tactile,,it's more investigative,,it's more apprehensive,,and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.,(Applause) 
 So, it's important for us that all nthe testing is done independently,,and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.,It'll be an ongoing process.,It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.,It's so important that this concept,is led with the science.,From the perspective of Shark nAttack Mitigation Systems,,we're a biotechnology licensing company,,so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.,We'll license others to do that. 
 But I thought you might be interested,in seeing what SAMS technology looks like,embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,,for the first time, live, worldwide --,(Laughter) —,I can show you what biological adaptation,,science and design looks like in real life.,So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,,from this side. Where are you, Sam?,(Applause),And Eduardo.,(Applause),Cheers, mate.,Cheers.,Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause) 
 So what have we done here?,Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet,and use science as a tool for invention,,we've paid attention to the biological evidence,,we've put importance to the,human anecdotal evidence,,and we've used science as a tool,for translation,,translation of something that was already there,into something that we can nuse for the benefit of mankind.,And it strikes me that this idea of science,as a tool for translation rather than invention,is one that we can apply much more widely than this,in the pursuit of innovation.,After all, did the Wright brothers,discover manned flight,,or did they observe the biological fact of flight,and translate that mechanically, replicate it,in a way that humans could use?,As for the humble wetsuit,,who knows what oceanwear will look like,in two years' time, in five years' time,or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,,I'm guessing there's a fair chance,it won't be pure black. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So when I do my job, people hate me.,In fact, the better I do my job,,the more people hate me.,And no, I'm not a meter maid,,and I'm not an undertaker.,I am a progressive, lesbianntalking head on Fox News. 
 (Applause) 
 So y'all heard that, right?nJust to make sure, right?,I am a gay talking head on Fox News.,I am going to tell you how I do it,,and the most important thing I've learned. 
 So I go on television.,I debate people who literally wantnto obliterate everything I believe in --,in some cases, who don't wantnme and people like me to even exist.,It's sort of like Thanksgivingnwith your conservative uncle,on steroids,,with a live televisionnaudience of millions.,It's totally almost just like that. 
 And that's just on air.,The hate mail I get is unbelievable.,Last week alone, I got 238npieces of nasty email,and more hate tweetsnthan I can even count.,I was called an idiot,na traitor, a scourge,,a cunt and an ugly man,,and that was just in one email. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what have I realized,,being on the receiving endnof all this ugliness?,Well, my biggest takeaway,is that for decades, we've been focusednon political correctness,,but what matters morenis emotional correctness.,Let me give you a small example.,I don't care if you call me a dyke.nI really don't.,I care about two things.,One, I care that you spell it right. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.,You'd totally be surprised.,And second, I don't care about the word,nI care about how you use it.,Are you being friendly?nAre you just being naive?,Or do you really wantnto hurt me personally? 
 Emotional correctnessnis the tone, the feeling,,how we say what we say,,the respect and compassionnwe show one another.,And what I've realizednis that political persuasion,doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.,Political persuasion beginsnwith being emotionally correct. 
 So when I first wentnto go work at Fox News,,true confession,,I expected there to be marks in the carpet,from all the knuckle-dragging.,That, by the way, in case you're payingnattention, is not emotionally correct.,But liberals on my side,,we can be self-righteous,nwe can be condescending,,we can be dismissive of anyonenwho doesn't agree with us.,In other words, we cannbe politically right,but emotionally wrong.,And incidentally, that means thatnpeople don't like us. Right? 
 Now here's the kicker.,Conservatives are really nice.,I mean, not all of them,,and not the ones who send me hate mail,,but you would be surprised.,Sean Hannity is one ofnthe sweetest guys I've ever met.,He spends his free timentrying to fix up his staff on blind dates,,and I know that if I ever had a problem,,he would do anything he could to help.,Now, I think Sean Hannitynis 99 percent politically wrong,,but his emotional correctnessnis strikingly impressive.,And that's why people listen to him.,Because you can't getnanyone to agree with you,if they don't even listen to you first.,We spend so much timentalking past each other,and not enough time talkingnthrough our disagreements.,And if we can start to findncompassion for one another,,then we have a shotnat building common ground.,It actually sounds really hokeynto say it standing up here,,but when you try to put it in practice,,it's really powerful. 
 So someone who says they hate immigrants,,I try to imagine how scared they must be,that their community is changingnfrom what they've always known.,Or someone who says theyndon't like teachers' unions,,I bet they're really devastated to seentheir kid's school going into the gutter,,and they're just lookingnfor someone to blame.,Our challenge is to findnthe compassion for others,that we want them to have for us.,That is emotional correctness. 
 I'm not saying it's easy.,An average of, like, 5.6 times per day,I have to stop myself from respondingnto all of my hate mail,with a flurry of vile profanities.,This whole finding compassionnand common ground with your enemies thing,is kind of like a political-spiritualnpractice for me,,and I ain't the Dalai Lama.,I'm not perfect,nbut what I am is optimistic.,Because I don't just get hate mail.,I get a lot of really nicenletters, lots of them.,And one of my all-time favorites begins:,"I am not a big fannof your political leanings,or your sometimes tortured logic, 
 (Laughter) 
 but I'm a big fan of you as a person.",Now this guy doesn'tnagree with me -- yet. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he's listening --,not because of what I said,nbut because of how I said it.,And somehow, even though we've never met,nwe've managed to form a connection.,That's emotional correctness,,and that's how we start the conversations,that really lead to change. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My job is to design, build and studynrobots that communicate with people.,But this story doesn't start with roboticsnat all, it starts with animation.,When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,",I was amazed by how muchnemotion they could put,into something as trivial as a desk lamp.,I mean, look at them --nat the end of this movie,,you actually feel somethingnfor two pieces of furniture. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said, I havento learn how to do this.,So I made a really bad career decision. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's what my momnwas like when I did it. 
 (Laughter) 
 I left a very cozy tech job in Israelnat a nice software company,and I moved to New Yorknto study animation.,And there I lived,in a collapsing apartment buildingnin Harlem with roommates.,I'm not using this phrasenmetaphorically --,the ceiling actually collapsednone day in our living room.,Whenever they did news storiesnabout building violations in New York,,they would put the reportnin front of our building,,as kind of, like, a backdropnto show how bad things are. 
 Anyway, during the day, I went to school,and at night I would sit and drawnframe by frame of pencil animation.,And I learned two surprising lessons.,One of them was thatnwhen you want to arouse emotions,,it doesn't matter so muchnhow something looks;,it's all in the motion, in the timingnof how the thing moves.,And the second was somethingnone of our teachers told us.,He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age.",And he said, "As an animator,nyou're not a director -- you're an actor.",So, if you want to findnthe right motion for a character,,don't think about it --ngo use your body to find it.,Stand in front of a mirror,nact it out in front of a camera --,whatever you need -- and thennput it back in your character. 
 A year later I found myself at MITnin the Robotic Life Group.,It was one of the first groupsnresearching the relationships,between humans and robots.,And I still had this dreamnto make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.,But I found that robots didn't movenat all in this engaging way,that I was used tonfrom my animation studies.,Instead, they were all --nhow should I put it --,they were all kind of robotic.,(Laughter),And I thought, what if I tooknwhatever I learned in animation school,,and used that to designnmy robotic desk lamp.,So I went and designed frame by frame,to try to make this robot as gracefulnand engaging as possible.,And here when you see the robotninteracting with me on a desktop --,and I'm actually redesigning the robot,,so, unbeknownst to itself,,it's kind of digging its ownngrave by helping me. 
 (Laughter) 
 I wanted it to be less of a mechanicalnstructure giving me light,,and more of a helpful,nkind of quiet apprentice,that's always there when you need itnand doesn't really interfere.,And when, for example, I'm lookingnfor a battery that I can't find,,in a subtle way, it'll show menwhere the battery is.,So you can see my confusion here.,I'm not an actor.,And I want you to noticenhow the same mechanical structure,can, at one point,njust by the way it moves,,seem gentle and caringnand in the other case,,seem violent and confrontational.,And it's the same structure,njust the motion is different.,Actor: "You want to know something?nWell, you want to know something?,He was already dead!,Just laying there, eyes glazed over!" 
 (Laughter) 
 But, moving in a graceful waynis just one building block,of this whole structurencalled human-robot interaction.,I was, at the time, doing my PhD,nI was working on human-robot teamwork,,teams of humans and robotsnworking together.,I was studying the engineering,,the psychology,nthe philosophy of teamwork,,and at the same time,,I found myself in my own kindnof teamwork situation,,with a good friend of mine,nwho's actually here.,And in that situation,nwe can easily imagine robots,in the near future being there with us.,It was after a Passover Seder.,We were folding upna lot of folding chairs,,and I was amazed at how quicklynwe found our own rhythm.,Everybody did their own part,nwe didn't have to divide our tasks.,We didn't have to communicatenverbally about this --,it all just happened. 
 And I thought, humans and robotsndon't look at all like this.,When humans and robots interact,nit's much more like a chess game:,the human does a thing, the robotnanalyzes whatever the human did,,the robot decides what to do next,nplans it and does it.,Then the human waits,nuntil it's their turn again.,So it's much more like a chess game,nand that makes sense,,because chess is great for mathematiciansnand computer scientists.,It's all about information, analysis,ndecision-making and planning. 
 But I wanted my robotnto be less of a chess player,,and more like a doer,that just clicks and works together.,So I made my secondnhorrible career choice:,I decided to study acting for a semester.,I took off from the PhD,nI went to acting classes.,I actually participated in a play --,I hope there’s no videonof that around still. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I got every booknI could find about acting,,including one from the 19th centurynthat I got from the library.,And I was really amazed, because my namenwas the second name on the list --,the previous name was in 1889. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this book wasnkind of waiting for 100 years,to be rediscovered for robotics.,And this book shows actors,how to move every muscle in the body,to match every kind of emotionnthat they want to express. 
 But the real revelation wasnwhen I learned about method acting.,It became very popularnin the 20th century.,And method acting said,you don't have to plannevery muscle in your body;,instead, you have to use your bodynto find the right movement.,You have to use your sense memorynto reconstruct the emotions,and kind of think with your bodynto find the right expression --,improvise, play off your scene partner.,And this came at the same time,as I was reading about this trendnin cognitive psychology,,called embodied cognition,nwhich also talks about the same ideas.,We use our bodies to think;,we don't just think with our brainsnand use our bodies to move,,but our bodies feed back into our brain,to generate the way that we behave. 
 And it was like a lightning bolt.,I went back to my office,,I wrote this paper,nwhich I never really published,,called "Acting Lessonsnfor Artificial Intelligence.",And I even took another month,to do what was then the first theater play,with a human and a robot acting together.,That's what you sawnbefore with the actors.,And I thought:,How can we make an artificialnintelligence model --,a computer, computational model --,that will model some of thesenideas of improvisation,,of taking risks, of taking chances,,even of making mistakes?,Maybe it can make for betternrobotic teammates.,So I worked for quitena long time on these models,and I implemented themnon a number of robots. 
 Here you can see a very early example,with the robots trying to usenthis embodied artificial intelligence,to try to match my movementsnas closely as possible.,It's sort of like a game.,Let's look at it.,You can see when I psychnit out, it gets fooled.,And it's a little bitnlike what you might see actors do,when they try to mirror each other,to find the right synchrony between them.,And then, I did another experiment,,and I got people off the streetnto use the robotic desk lamp,,and try out this ideanof embodied artificial intelligence.,So, I actually used two kindsnof brains for the same robot. 
 The robot is the same lamp that you saw,,and I put two brains in it.,For one half of the people,,I put in a brainnthat's kind of the traditional,,calculated robotic brain.,It waits for its turn,nit analyzes everything, it plans.,Let's call it the calculated brain.,The other got more the stagenactor, risk-taker brain.,Let's call it the adventurous brain.,It sometimes acts without knowingneverything it has to know.,It sometimes makes mistakesnand corrects them.,And I had them do this very tedious tasknthat took almost 20 minutes,,and they had to work together,,somehow simulating, like, a factory job,of repetitively doing the same thing.,What I found is that peoplenactually loved the adventurous robot.,They thought it was more intelligent,,more committed,na better member of the team,,contributed to the successnof the team more.,They even called it "he" and "she,",whereas people with the calculated brain,called it "it," and nobodynever called it "he" or "she.",When they talked about it after the task,nwith the adventurous brain,,they said, "By the end, we were goodnfriends and high-fived mentally.",Whatever that means. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sounds painful.,Whereas the peoplenwith the calculated brain,said it was just like a lazy apprentice.,It only did what it was supposednto do and nothing more,,which is almost what peoplenexpect robots to do,,so I was surprised that peoplenhad higher expectations of robots,than what anybody in roboticsnthought robots should be doing.,And in a way, I thought,nmaybe it's time --,just like method actingnchanged the way people thought,about acting in the 19th century,,from going from the very calculated,nplanned way of behaving,,to a more intuitive, risk-taking,nembodied way of behaving --,maybe it's time for robotsnto have the same kind of revolution. 
 A few years later, I was at my nextnresearch job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,,and I was working in a groupndealing with robotic musicians.,And I thought, music:nthat's the perfect place,to look at teamwork, coordination,ntiming, improvisation --,and we just got this robotnplaying marimba.,And the marimba, for everybody like me,,it was this huge, wooden xylophone.,And when I was looking at this,,I looked at other worksnin human-robot improvisation --,yes, there are other worksnin human-robot improvisation --,and they were also a little bitnlike a chess game.,The human would play,,the robot analyzed what was played,,and would improvise their own part.,So, this is what musicians calledna call-and-response interaction,,and it also fits very wellnrobots and artificial intelligence.,But I thought, if I use the same ideasnI used in the theater play,and in the teamwork studies,,maybe I can make the robotsnjam together like a band.,Everybody's riffing off each other,nnobody is stopping for a moment.,And so I tried to do the samenthings, this time with music,,where the robot doesn't really knownwhat it's about to play,,it just sort of moves its bodynand uses opportunities to play,,and does what my jazz teachernwhen I was 17 taught me.,She said, when you improvise,,sometimes you don't knownwhat you're doing, and you still do it.,So I tried to make a robot that doesn'tnactually know what it's doing,,but is still doing it.,So let's look at a few secondsnfrom this performance,,where the robot listensnto the human musician,and improvises.,And then, look how the humannmusician also responds,to what the robot is doing,and picking up from its behavior,,and at some point can even be surprisednby what the robot came up with. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Being a musiciannis not just about making notes,,otherwise nobodynwould ever go see a live show.,Musicians also communicatenwith their bodies,,with other band members,nwith the audience,,they use their bodiesnto express the music.,And I thought, we already havena robot musician on stage,,why not make it bena full-fledged musician?,And I started designingna socially expressive head,for the robot.,The head doesn’t actuallyntouch the marimba,,it just expresses what the music is like.,These are some napkin sketchesnfrom a bar in Atlanta,that was dangerouslynlocated exactly halfway,between my lab and my home.,So I spent, I would say, on average,nthree to four hours a day there.,I think. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I went back to my animationntools and tried to figure out,not just what a roboticnmusician would look like,,but especially what a roboticnmusician would move like,,to sort of show that it doesn't likenwhat the other person is playing --,and maybe show whatever beatnit's feeling at the moment. 
 So we ended up actually getting the moneynto build this robot, which was nice.,I'm going to show you nownthe same kind of performance,,this time with a socially expressive head.,And notice one thing --,how the robot is really showing us,the beat it's picking up from the human,,while also giving the human a sensenthat the robot knows what it's doing.,And also how it changes the way it moves,as soon as it starts its own solo. 
 (Music) 
 Now it's looking at me,nshowing that it's listening. 
 (Music) 
 Now look at the final chordnof the piece again.,And this time the robotncommunicates with its body,when it's busy doing its own thing,,and when it's ready to coordinatenthe final chord with me. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ending) 
 (Final chord) 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks.,I hope you see,how much this part of the bodynthat doesn't touch the instrument,actually helpsnwith the musical performance.,And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,,so obviously some rappernwill come into our lab at some point --,and we had this rapper come in and dona little jam with the robot.,Here you can see the robotnbasically responding to the beat.,Notice two things:,one, how irresistible it is to joinnthe robot while it's moving its head.,You kind of want to movenyour own head when it does it.,And second, even though the rappernis really focused on his iPhone,,as soon as the robot turnsnto him, he turns back.,So even though it's justnin the periphery of his vision,,in the corner of his eye,nit's very powerful.,And the reason is that we can't ignore,physical things moving in our environment.,We are wired for that.,So if you have a problem --,maybe your partner is lookingnat their iPhone or smartphone too much --,you might want to have a robotnthere to get their attention. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Just to introduce the last robotnthat we've worked on,,it came out of somethingnsurprising that we found:,Some point people didn't carenabout the robot being intelligent,,able to improvise and listen,,and do all these embodied intelligencenthings that I spent years developing.,They really liked that the robotnwas enjoying the music. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they didn't say the robotnwas moving to the music,,they said "enjoying" the music.,And we thought,nwhy don't we take this idea,,and I designed a new piece of furniture.,This time it wasn't a desk lamp,nit was a speaker dock,,one of those thingsnyou plug your smartphone in.,And I thought,,what would happen if your speaker dockndidn't just play the music for you,,but would actually enjoy it, too?,And so again, here are somenanimation tests from an early stage. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is what the finalnproduct looked like. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 So, a lot of bobbing heads. 
 (Applause) 
 A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,,so we can still seenrobots influence people.,And it's not just fun and games. 
 I think one of the reasons I care so much,about robots that usentheir body to communicate,and use their body to move is --,I'm going to let you in on a littlensecret we roboticists are hiding --,is that every one of younis going to be living with a robot,at some point in your life.,Somewhere in your future,nthere will be a robot in your life.,If not in yours, your children's lives.,And I want these robots to be more fluent,nmore engaging, more graceful,than currently they seem to be.,And for that I think maybe robotsnneed to be less like chess players,and more like stage actorsnand more like musicians.,Maybe they should be ablento take chances and improvise.,Maybe they should be ablento anticipate what you're about to do.,Maybe they even need to be ablento make mistakes and correct them,,because in the end, we are human.,And maybe as humans,nrobots that are a little less than perfect,are just perfect for us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Two years ago, I have to say there was no problem.,Two years ago, I knew exactly nwhat an icon looked like.,It looks like this.,Everybody's icon, but also the default position,of a curator of Italian Renaissance npaintings, which I was then.,And in a way, this is also another default selection.,Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image,of the "Lady with an Ermine.",And I use that word, soulful, deliberately.,Or then there's this, or rather these:,the two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks",that were about to come together nin London for the very first time.,In the exhibition that I was then in nthe absolute throes of organizing.,I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,,and I had been for three years.,So, he was occupying every part of my brain.,Leonardo had taught me, during that three years,,about what a picture can do.,About taking you from your own nmaterial world into a spiritual world.,He said, actually, that he believed nthe job of the painter,was to paint everything that was visible nand invisible in the universe.,That's a huge task. And yet, nsomehow he achieves it.,He shows us, I think, the human soul.,He shows us the capacity of ourselves,to move into a spiritual realm.,To see a vision of the universe that's nmore perfect than our own.,To see God's own plan, in some sense.,So this, in a sense, was really nwhat I believed an icon was. 
 At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell, 
 director here of the Metropolitan Museum,,about what my next move might be.,The move, in fact, back to an earlier life,,one I'd begun at the British Museum,,back to the world of three dimensions --,of sculpture and of decorative arts --,to take over the department of European sculpture nand decorative arts, here at the Met.,But it was an incredibly busy time.,All the conversations were done nat very peculiar times of the day --,over the phone.,In the end, I accepted the job,without actually having been here.,Again, I'd been there a couple of years before,,but on that particular visit.,So, it was just before the time that nthe Leonardo show was due to open,when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,,to see my new domain.,To see what European sculpture nand decorative arts looked like,,beyond those Renaissance collections nwith which I was so already familiar.,And I thought, on that very first day, nI better tour the galleries.,Fifty-seven of these galleries --,like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.,I walked through and I started in my comfort zonenin the Italian Renaissance.,And then I moved gradually around,,feeling a little lost sometimes.,My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition,that was about to open, and I came across this.,And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?,There was absolutely no connection in my mind,at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,,it was a kind of repulsion.,This object felt utterly and completely alien.,Silly at a level that I hadn't yet nunderstood silliness to be.,And then it was made worse --,there were two of them.,(Laughter),So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,,that I disliked this object so much.,What was the anatomy of my distaste?,Well, so much gold, so vulgar.,You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.,Leonardo himself had preached nagainst the use of gold,,so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.,And then there's little pretty sprigs nof flowers everywhere. (Laughter),And finally, that pink. That damned pink.,It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.,I mean, it's a color that I can't think of nanything that you actually see in nature,,that looks that shade.,The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter),This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit,that sits at the bottom of the vase.,It reminded me, in an odd kind of way,,of my niece's fifth birthday party.,Where all the little girls would come neither as a princess or a fairy.,There was one who would come as a fairy princess.,You should have seen the looks.,(Laughter),And I realize that this object was in my mind,,born from the same mind, from the same womb,,practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter),And then there's the elephants. (Laughter),Those extraordinary elephants,with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions,and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with nthese golden tusks and so on.,I realized this was an elephant that had,absolutely nothing to do with a majestic nmarch across the Serengeti.,It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter) 
 But something more profound nwas happening as well.,These objects, it seemed to me,,were quintessentially the kind that I nand my liberal left friends in London,had always seen as summing up,something deplorable about the French aristocracy,in the 18th century.,The label had told me that these pieces were made,by the Sèvres Manufactory,,made of porcelain in the late 1750s,,and designed by a designer called nJean-Claude Duplessis,,actually somebody of extraordinary distinction,as I later learned.,But for me, they summed up a kind of,,that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy,in the 18th century.,I and my colleagues had always thought,that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,,you know -- no wonder there was a revolution.,Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.,There was a sort of idea really, that,,if you owned a vase like this,,then there was really only one fate possible.,(Laughter) 
 So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.,But I took the job and I went non looking at these vases.,I sort of had to because they're non a through route in the Met.,So, almost anywhere I went, there they were.,They had this kind of odd sort of fascination,,like a car accident.,Where I couldn't stop looking.,And as I did so, I started thinking:,Well, what are we actually looking at here?,And what I started with was understanding this,as really a supreme piece of design.,It took me a little time.,But, that tutu for example --,actually, this is a piece that ndoes dance in its own way.,It has an extraordinary lightness,and yet, it is also amazing balanced.,It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.,And then the play between --,actually really quite carefully disposed ncolor and gilding, and the sculptural surface,,is really rather remarkable.,And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln,four times, at least four times nin order to arrive at this.,How many moments for accident can you think of,that could have happened to this piece?,And then remember, not just one, but two.,So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched,vases of this kind.,And then this question of uselessness.,Well actually, the end of the trunks nwere originally candle holders.,So what you would have had nwere candles on either side.,Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.,On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.,It would have glittered in an interior,,a little like a little firework. 
 And at that point, actually, na firework went off in my brain.,Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --,which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --,actually comes from the same nroot as the word 'fantasy.',And that what this object was just as much in a way,,in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,,is a portal to somewhere else.,This is an object of the imagination.,If you think about the mad 18th-century noperas of the time -- set in the Orient.,If you think about divans and perhaps even nopium-induced visions of pink elephants,,then at that point, this object starts to make sense.,This is an object which is all about escapism.,It's about an escapism that happens --,that the aristocracy in France sought,very deliberately,to distinguish themselves from ordinary people. 
 It's not an escapism that,we feel particularly happy with today, however.,And again, going on thinking about this,,I realize that in a way we're all victims,of a certain kind of tyranny,of the triumph of modernism,whereby form and function in an object,have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.,And the extraneous ornament is seen as really,,essentially, criminal.,It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeoisnvalues rather than aristocratic ones.,And that seems fine.,Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of nsequestration of imagination.,So just as in the 20th century, so many people,had the idea that their faith,took place on the Sabbath day,,and the rest of their lives --,their lives of washing machines and orthodontics --,took place on another day.,Then, I think we've started doing the same.,We've allowed ourselves to,lead our fantasy lives in front of screens.,In the dark of the cinema, with thentelevision in the corner of the room.,We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant,of the imagination that these vases nrepresented in people's lives.,So maybe it's time we got this back a little.,I think it's beginning to happen.,In London, for example,,with these extraordinary buildings,that have been appearing over the last few years.,Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction,,turning London into a kind of fantasy playground.,It's actually amazing to look out of na high building nowadays there.,But even then, there's a resistance.,London has called these buildings the nGherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --,bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.,There's an idea that we don't want these,anxious-making, imaginative journeys nto happen in our daily lives.,I feel lucky in a way,,I've encountered this object.,(Laughter),I found him on the Internet when nI was looking up a reference.,And there he was.,And unlike the pink elephant vase,,this was a kind of love at first sight.,In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.,And he now adorns my office.,He's a Staffordshire figure made nin the middle of the 19th century.,He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, nplaying Shakespeare's Richard III.,And it's based, actually, on a more nelevated piece of porcelain.,So I loved, on an art historical level,,I loved that layered quality that he has.,But more than that, I love him.,In a way that I think would have been impossible,without the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.,I love his orange and pink breeches.,I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,,having just finished the washing up. (Laughter),He seems also to have forgotten his sword.,I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.,In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.,He's, I hope, a little bit dignified,,but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter),And energetic, I hope, too.,I let him into my life because the Sèvresnpink elephant vase allowed me to do so.,And before that Leonardo,,I understood that this object could become npart of a journey for me every day,,sitting in my office.,I really hope that others, all of you,,visiting objects in the museum,,and taking them home and nfinding them for yourselves,,will allow those objects to flourish nin your imaginative lives.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Picture this:,It's Monday morning,,you're at the office,,you're settling in for the day at work,,and this guy that you sort of nrecognize from down the hall,,walks right into your cubicle,and he steals your chair.,Doesn't say a word —,just rolls away with it.,Doesn't give you any informationnabout why he took your chair,out of all the other chairs nthat are out there.,Doesn't acknowledge the fact nthat you might need your chair,to get some work done today.,You wouldn't stand for nit. You'd make a stink.,You'd follow that guynback to his cubicle,and you'd say, "Why my chair?" 
 Okay, so now it's Tuesday morningnand you're at the office,,and a meeting invitation pops nup in your calendar.,(Laughter),And it's from this woman who you nkind of know from down the hall,,and the subject line references some nproject that you heard a little bit about.,But there's no agenda.,There's no information about whynyou were invited to the meeting.,And yet you accept the nmeeting invitation, and you go.,And when this highly nunproductive session is over,,you go back to your desk,,and you stand at your ndesk and you say,,"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,,like I wish I had my chair back.",(Laughter) 
 Every day, we allow our coworkers,,who are otherwise very, nvery nice people,,to steal from us.,And I'm talking about something far nmore valuable than office furniture.,I'm talking about time. Your time.,In fact, I believe that,we are in the middlenof a global epidemic,of a terrible new illnessnknown as MAS:,Mindless Accept Syndrome.,(Laughter),The primary symptom of nMindless Accept Syndrome,is just accepting a meeting invitationnthe minute it pops up in your calendar.,(Laughter),It's an involuntary reflex — ding, nclick, bing — it's in your calendar,,"Gotta go, I'm already late nfor a meeting." (Laughter) 
 Meetings are important, right?,And collaboration is key to nthe success of any enterprise.,And a well-run meeting can yield nreally positive, actionable results.,But between globalization,and pervasive information technology,,the way that we work,has really changed dramatically nover the last few years.,And we're miserable. (Laughter),And we're miserable not because the nother guy can't run a good meeting,,it's because of MAS, our nMindless Accept Syndrome,,which is a self-inflicted wound. 
 Actually, I have evidence to proventhat MAS is a global epidemic.,Let me tell you why.,A couple of years ago, I put a video non Youtube, and in the video,,I acted out every terrible nconference call you've ever been on.,It goes on for about five minutes,,and it has all the things that we nhate about really bad meetings.,There's the moderator who has nno idea how to run the meeting.,There are the participants who nhave no idea why they're there.,The whole thing kind of collapsesninto this collaborative train wreck.,And everybody leaves very angry.,It's kind of funny.,(Laughter),Let's take a quick look.,(Video) Our goal today is to come to an nagreement on a very important proposal.,As a group, we need to decide if —,bloop bloop —,Hi, who just joined?,Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.,(Laughter),Hi, Joe. Thanks for njoining us today, great.,I was just saying, we have a lot of people non the call we'd like to get through,,so let's skip the roll call,and I'm gonna dive right in.,Our goal today is to come to an nagreement on a very important proposal.,As a group, we need to decide if —,bloop bloop —,(Laughter),Hi, who just joined?,No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter) 
 Sound familiar?,Yeah, it sounds familiar nto me, too.,A couple of weeks after I put that online,,500,000 people in dozens of countries,,I mean dozens of countries,,watched this video.,And three years later, it's still getting nthousands of views every month.,It's close to about a million right now.,And in fact, some of the biggestncompanies in the world,,companies that you've nheard of but I won't name,,have asked for my permission to use nthis video in their new-hire training,to teach their new employees how nnot to run a meeting at their company.,And if the numbers —,there are a million views and it'snbeing used by all these companies —,aren't enough proof that we have na global problem with meetings,,there are the many, many thousands,of comments posted online,after the video went up.,Thousands of people wrote things like,,"OMG, that was my day today!","That was my day every day!","This is my life.",One guy wrote,,"It's funny because it's true.,Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.,It made me laugh until I cried.,And cried. And I cried some more.",(Laughter),This poor guy said,,"My daily life until nretirement or death, sigh.",These are real quotes,and it's real sad. 
 A common theme running throughnall of these comments online,is this fundamental belief nthat we are powerless,to do anything other nthan go to meetings,and suffer through these npoorly run meetings,and live to meet another day.,But the truth is, we're nnot powerless at all.,In fact, the cure for MASnis right here in our hands.,It's right at our fingertips, literally.,It's something that I call ¡No MAS!,(Laughter),Which, if I remember my nhigh school Spanish,,means something like, n"Enough already, make it stop!" 
 Here's how No MAS nworks. It's very simple.,First of all, the next time you nget a meeting invitation,that doesn't have a lot nof information in it at all,,click the tentative button!,It's okay, you're allowed, nthat's why it's there.,It's right next to the accept button.,Or the maybe button, or whatever button nis there for you not to accept immediately.,Then, get in touch with the personnwho asked you to the meeting.,Tell them you're very excited nto support their work,,ask them what the goal nof the meeting is,,and tell them you're interested in learning nhow you can help them achieve their goal.,And if we do this often enough,,and we do it respectfully,,people might start to be na little bit more thoughtful,about the way they put togethernmeeting invitations.,And you can make more thoughtful ndecisions about accepting it.,People might actually start nsending out agendas. Imagine!,Or they might not have a conference callnwith 12 people to talk about a status,when they could just do a quicknemail and get it done with.,People just might start to change their nbehavior because you changed yours.,And they just might bringnyour chair back, too. (Laughter),No MAS!,Thank you.,(Applause).A couple of years ago,,Harvard Business School chose,the best business model of that year.,It chose Somali piracy.,Pretty much around the same time,,I discovered that there were 544 seafarers,being held hostage on ships,,often anchored just off the Somali coast,in plain sight. 
 And I learned these two facts, and I thought,,what's going on in shipping?,And I thought, would that happennin any other industry?,Would we see 544 airline pilots,held captive in their jumbo jets,on a runway for months, or a year?,Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?,It wouldn't happen. 
 So I started to get intrigued.,And I discovered another fact,,which to me was more astonishing,almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before,at the age of 42, 43.,That is how fundamentally nwe still depend on shipping.,Because perhaps the general public,thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,,something brought by sailboat,with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.,But shipping isn't that.,Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.,Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.,Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.,We are more dependent on it now than ever.,And yet, for such an enormous industry --,there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea —,it's become pretty much invisible. 
 Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,,because here shipping is so present,that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.,(Laughter),But elsewhere in the world,,if you ask the general public what they know,about shipping and how muchntrade is carried by sea,,you will get essentially a blank face.,You will ask someone on the street,if they've heard of Microsoft.,I should think they'll say yes,,because they'll know that they make software,that goes on computers,,and occasionally works.,But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,,I doubt you'd get the same response,,even though Maersk,,which is just one shipping company amongst many,,has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.,[$60.2 billion] 
 Now why is this?,A few years ago,,the first sea lord of the British admiralty --,he is called the first sea lord,,although the chief of the army is not called a land lord —,he said that we, and he meant,in the industrialized nations in the West,,that we suffer from sea blindness.,We are blind to the sea,as a place of industry or of work.,It's just something we fly over,,a patch of blue on an airline map.,Nothing to see, move along. 
 So I wanted to open my own eyes,to my own sea blindness,,so I ran away to sea.,A couple of years ago, I took a passage,on the Maersk Kendal,,a mid-sized container ship,carrying nearly 7,000 boxes,,and I departed from Felixstowe,,on the south coast of England,,and I ended up right here in Singapore,five weeks later,,considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.,And it was a revelation.,We traveled through five seas,,two oceans, nine ports,,and I learned a lot about shipping. 
 And one of the first things that surprised me,when I got on board Kendal,was, where are all the people?,I have friends in the Navy who tell me,they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,,but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.,Now that's because shipping is very efficient.,Containerization has made it very efficient.,Ships have automation now.,They can operate with small crews.,But it also means that, in the words,of a port chaplain I once met,,the average seafarer you're going to find,on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,,because the pace of modern shipping,is quite punishing for what the shipping calls,its human element,,a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize,sounds a little bit inhuman.,So most seafarers now working on container ships,often have less than two hours in port at a time.,They don't have time to relax.,They're at sea for months at a time,,and even when they're on board,,they don't have access to what,a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet. 
 And another thing that surprised menwhen I got on board Kendal,was who I was sitting next to --,Not the queen; I can't imagine whynthey put me underneath her portrait --,But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,,I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,,I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.,On the next table was a Chinese guy,,and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.,So that was a normal working ship. 
 Now how is that possible?,Because the biggest dramatic change,in shipping over the last 60 years,,when most of the general public stopped noticing it,,was something called an open registry,,or a flag of convenience.,Ships can now fly the flag of any nation,that provides a flag registry.,You can get a flag from the landlocked nation,of Bolivia, or Mongolia,,or North Korea, though that's not very popular.,(Laughter) 
 So we have these very multinational,,global, mobile crews on ships.,And that was a surprise to me.,And when we got to pirate waters,,down the Bab-el-Mandeb straitnand into the Indian Ocean,,the ship changed.,And that was also shocking, because suddenly,,I realized, as the captain said to me,,that I had been crazy to choose to go,through pirate waters on a container ship.,We were no longer allowed on deck.,There were double pirate watches.,And at that time, there were those n544 seafarers being held hostage,,and some of them were held hostage for years,because of the nature of shippingnand the flag of convenience.,Not all of them, but some of them were,,because for the minoritynof unscrupulous ship owners,,it can be easy to hide behind,the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience. 
 What else does our sea blindness mask?,Well, if you go out to sea on a ship,or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,,you'll see very black smoke.,And that's because shipping,has very tight margins,nand they want cheap fuel,,so they use something called bunker fuel,,which was described to menby someone in the tanker industry,as the dregs of the refinery,,or just one step up from asphalt.,And shipping is the greenest method of transport.,In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,,it emits about a thousandth of aviation,and about a tenth of trucking.,But it's not benign, because there's so much of it.,So shipping emissions arenabout three to four percent,,almost the same as aviation's.,And if you put shipping emissions,on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,,it would come in about sixth,,somewhere near Germany.,It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships,pollute in terms of particles and soot,and noxious gases,as much as all the cars in the world.,And the good news is that,people are now talking about sustainable shipping.,There are interesting initiatives going on.,But why has it taken so long?,When are we going to start talking and thinking,about shipping miles as well as air miles? 
 I also traveled to Cape Cod to look,at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,,because this to me was onenof the most surprising things,about my time at sea,,and what it made me think about.,We know about man's impact on the ocean,in terms of fishing and overfishing,,but we don't really know much about,what's happening underneath the water.,And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,,because shipping noise has contributed,to damaging the acousticnhabitats of ocean creatures.,Light doesn't penetrate beneathnthe surface of the water,,so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins,and even 800 species of fish,communicate by sound.,And a North Atlantic right whale,can transmit across hundreds of miles.,A humpback can transmit a sound,across a whole ocean.,But a supertanker can also be heard,coming across a whole ocean,,and because the noise thatnpropellers make underwater,is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,,then it can damage their acoustic habitat,,and they need this for breeding,,for finding feeding grounds,,for finding mates.,And the acoustic habitat of thenNorth Atlantic right whale,has been reduced by up to 90 percent.,But there are no laws governing nacoustic pollution yet. 
 And when I arrived in Singapore,,and I apologize for this, but I ndidn't want to get off my ship.,I'd really loved being on board Kendal.,I'd been well treated by the crew,,I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,,and I would happily have signed upnfor another five weeks,,something that the captain also said,I was crazy to think about.,But I wasn't there for nine months at a time,like the Filipino seafarers,,who, when I asked them to describe their job to me,,called it "dollar for homesickness.",They had good salaries,,but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life,in a dangerous and often difficult element. 
 But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,,because I want to salute those seafarers,who bring us 90 percent of everything,and get very little thanks or recognition for it.,I want to salute the 100,000 ships,that are at sea,that are doing that work, coming in and out,every day, bringing us what we need.,But I also want to see shipping,,and us, the general public,nwho know so little about it,,to have a bit more scrutiny,,to be a bit more transparent,,to have 90 percent transparency.,Because I think we could all benefit,from doing something very simple,,which is learning to see the sea. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have spent the last years,trying to resolve two enigmas:,Why is productivity so disappointing,in all the companies where I work?,I have worked with more than 500 companies.,Despite all the technological advances --,computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,,the Internet.,Enigma number two:,Why is there so little engagement at work?,Why do people feel so miserable,,even actively disengaged?,Disengaging their colleagues.,Acting against the interest of their company.,Despite all the affiliation events,,the celebration, the people initiatives,,the leadership development programs to train,managers on how to better motivate their teams. 
 At the beginning, I thought there was,a chicken and egg issue:,Because people are less engaged, nthey are less productive.,Or vice versa, because they are less productive,,we put more pressure and they are less engaged.,But as we were doing our analysis,we realized that there was a common root cause,to these two issues,that relates, in fact, to the basic npillars of management.,The way we organize is based on two pillars.,The hard -- structure, processes, systems.,The soft --,feelings, sentiments, interpersonalnrelationships, traits, personality.,And whenever a company,reorganizes, restructures, reengineers,,goes through a cultural transformation program,,it chooses these two pillars.,Now, we try to refine them,,we try to combine them.,The real issue is --,and this is the answer to the two enigmas --,these pillars are obsolete.,Everything you read in business books is based,either on one or the other,or their combination.,They are obsolete.,How do they work,when you try to use these approaches,in front of the new complexity of business?,The hard approach, basically nis that you start from strategy,,requirements, structures, processes, nsystems, KPIs, scorecards,,committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,,you name it.,I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, nmiddle offices and interfaces.,What happens basically on the left,,you have more complexity, the nnew complexity of business.,We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.,And every time there is a new requirement,,we use the same approach.,We create dedicated structure processed systems,,basically to deal with the nnew complexity of business.,The hard approach creates just complicatedness,in the organization. 
 Let's take an example.,An automotive company, the engineering division,is a five-dimensional matrix.,If you open any cell of the matrix,,you find another 20-dimensional matrix.,You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,,Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.,For any new requirement,,you have a dedicated function,in charge of aligning engineers against,the new requirement.,What happens when the new nrequirement emerges?,Some years ago, a new requirement,appeared on the marketplace:,the length of the warranty period.,So therefore the new requirement is repairability,,making cars easy to repair.,Otherwise when you bring the car nto the garage to fix the light,,if you have to remove the engine,to access the lights,,the car will have to stay one week in the garage,instead of two hours, and the nwarranty budget will explode.,So, what was the solution using the hard approach?,If repairability is the new requirement,,the solution is to create a new function,,Mr. Repairability.,And Mr. Repairability creates nthe repairability process.,With a repairability scorecard, nwith a repairability metric,and eventually repairability incentive.,That came on top of 25 other KPIs.,What percentage of these people is variable compensation?,Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,,repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.,What difference did it make in their actions,,their choices to simplify? Zero.,But what occurs for zero impact? nMr. Repairability, process,,scorecard, evaluation, coordination nwith the 25 other coordinators,to have zero impact. 
 Now, in front of the new complexity of business,,the only solution is not drawing boxes,with reporting lines.,It is basically the interplay.,How the parts work together.,The connections, the interactions, the synapses.,It is not the skeleton of boxes, nit is the nervous system,of adaptiveness and intelligence.,You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.,Whenever people cooperate,,they use less resources. In everything.,You know, the repairability issue,is a cooperation problem.,When you design cars, please take into account,the needs of those who will repair the cars,in the after sales garages.,When we don't cooperate we need more time,,more equipment, more systems, more teams.,We need -- When procurement, supply nchain, manufacturing don't cooperate,we need more stock, more inventories, nmore working capital.,Who will pay for that?,Shareholders? Customers?,No, they will refuse.,So who is left? nThe employees,,who have to compensate through their super,individual efforts for the lack of cooperation.,Stress, burnout, they are noverwhelmed, accidents.,No wonder they disengage.,How do the hard and the softntry to foster cooperation?,The hard: In banks, when there is a problem,between the back office and the front office,,they don't cooperate. What is the solution?,They create a middle office.,What happens one year later?,Instead of one problem nbetween the back and the front,,now I have two problems.,Between the back and the middle,and between the middle and the front.,Plus I have to pay for the middle office.,The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.,It can only add new boxes, nnew bones in the skeleton. 
 The soft approach:,To make people cooperate, we need nto make them like each other.,Improve interpersonal feelings,,the more people like each other, nthe more they will cooperate.,It is totally wrong.,It is even counterproductive.,Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?,Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.,(Laughter),Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.,And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife,is precisely because I love my wife.,If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:,You will watch my favorite football game,,if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?,(Laughter),The more we like each other,,the more we avoid the real cooperation,that would strain our relationships nby imposing tough tradeoffs.,And we go for a second TV or we escalate,the decision above for arbitration.,Definitely, these approaches are obsolete. 
 To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,,we have created what we call nthe smart simplicity approach,based on simple rules.,Simple rule number one:,Understand what others do.,What is their real work?,We need to go beyond the boxes,,the job descriptions, beyond the surface,of the container, to understand the real content.,Me, designer, if I put a wire here,,I know that it will mean that we will have to,remove the engine to access the lights.,Second, you need to reenforce integrators.,Integrators are not middle noffices, they are managers,,existing managers that you reinforce,so that they have power and interest,to make others cooperate.,How can you reinforce your nmanagers as integrators?,By removing layers.,When there are too many layers,people are too far from the action,,therefore they need KPIs, metrics,,they need poor proxies for reality.,They don't understand reality,and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.,By removing rules -- the bigger we are,,the more we need integrators,,therefore the less rules we must have,,to give discretionary power to managers.,And we do the opposite --,the bigger we are, the more rules we create.,And we end up with the Encyclopedia nBritannica of rules.,You need to increase the quanitity of power,so that you can empower everybody,to use their judgment, their intelligence.,You must give more cards to people,so that they have the critical mass of cards,to take the risk to cooperate,,to move out of insulation.,Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.,These rules, they come from game theory,and organizational sociology.,You can increase the shadow of the future.,Create feedback loops that expose people,to the consequences of their actions.,This is what the automotive company did,when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.,They said to the design engineers:,Now, in three years, when the new ncar is launched on the market,,you will move to the after sales nnetwork, and become in charge,of the warranty budget,,and if the warranty budget explodes,,it will explode in your face. (Laughter),Much more powerful than 0.8 npercent variable compensation.,You need also to increase reciprocity,,by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.,When you remove these buffers,,you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.,We will cooperate.,Remove the second TV.,There are many second TVs at work,that don't create value,,they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.,You need to reward those who cooperate,and blame those who don't cooperate.,The CEO of The Lego Group,,Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.,He says, blame is not for failure,,it is for failing to help or ask for help.,It changes everything.,Suddenly it becomes in myninterest to be transparent,on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,,because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,,but if I fail to help or ask for help.,When you do this, it has a lot of implications,on organizational design.,You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;,you look at their interplay.,It has a lot of implications on financial policies,that we use.,On human resource management practices.,When you do that, you can manage complexity,,the new complexity of business,,without getting complicated.,You create more value with lower cost.,You simultaneously improve nperformance and satisfaction at work,because you have removed the common root cause,that hinders both.,Complicatedness: This is your nbattle, business leaders.,The real battle is not against competitors.,This is rubbish, very abstract.,When do we meet competitors to fight them?,The real battle is against ourselves,,against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.,Only you can fight, can do it.,Thank you.,(Applause)"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,,and Mourners to and fro,kept treading -- treading --ntill [it seemed],that Sense was breaking through --,And when they all were seated,,a Service, like a Drum --,kept beating -- beating --ntill I [thought],my Mind was going numb --,And then I heard them lift a Boxnand creak across my Soul,with those same Boots of Lead, again,,then Space -- began to toll,,As [all] the Heavens were a Bell,nand Being, [but] an Ear,,and I, and Silence, some strange Race,,wrecked, solitary, here --,[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,,and I fell down and down --,and hit a World, at every plunge,,and Finished knowing -- then --" 
 We know depression through metaphors.,Emily Dickinson was ablento convey it in language,,Goya in an image.,Half the purpose of artnis to describe such iconic states. 
 As for me, I had alwaysnthought myself tough,,one of the people who could survive,if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. 
 In 1991, I had a series of losses.,My mother died,,a relationship I'd been in ended,,I moved back to the United Statesnfrom some years abroad,,and I got through all of thosenexperiences intact. 
 But in 1994, three years later,,I found myself losing interestnin almost everything.,I didn't want to do any of the thingsnI had previously wanted to do,,and I didn't know why.,The opposite of depressionnis not happiness, but vitality.,And it was vitality,that seemed to seep awaynfrom me in that moment.,Everything there was to donseemed like too much work.,I would come home,and I would see the red lightnflashing on my answering machine,,and instead of being thrillednto hear from my friends,,I would think,,"What a lot of people that isnto have to call back.",Or I would decide I should have lunch,,and then I would think,nbut I'd have to get the food out,and put it on a plate,and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,,and it felt to menlike the Stations of the Cross. 
 And one of the things that often gets lostnin discussions of depression,is that you know it's ridiculous.,You know it's ridiculousnwhile you're experiencing it.,You know that most people manage,to listen to their messages and eat lunch,and organize themselves to take a shower,and go out the front door,and that it's not a big deal,,and yet you are nonetheless in its grip,and you are unable to figure outnany way around it.,And so I began to feel myself doing less,and thinking less,and feeling less.,It was a kind of nullity. 
 And then the anxiety set in.,If you told me that I'd have to bendepressed for the next month,,I would say, "As long I know it'll be overnin November, I can do it.",But if you said to me,,"You have to have acute anxietynfor the next month,",I would rather slit my wristnthan go through it.,It was the feeling all the time,like that feeling you havenif you're walking,and you slip or tripnand the ground is rushing up at you,,but instead of lasting half a second,nthe way that does,,it lasted for six months.,It's a sensationnof being afraid all the time,but not even knowingnwhat it is that you're afraid of.,And it was at that pointnthat I began to think,that it was just too painful to be alive,,and that the only reasonnnot to kill oneself,was so as not to hurt other people. 
 And finally one day, I woke up,and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,,because I lay in bed completely frozen,,looking at the telephone, thinking,,"Something is wrongnand I should call for help,",and I couldn't reach out my arm,and pick up the phone and dial.,And finally, after four full hoursnof my lying and staring at it,,the phone rang,,and somehow I managed to pick it up,,and it was my father, and I said,,"I'm in serious trouble.nWe need to do something." 
 The next day I startednwith the medications and the therapy.,And I also started reckoningnwith this terrible question:,If I'm not the tough person,who could have made itnthrough a concentration camp,,then who am I?,And if I have to take medication,,is that medication making menmore fully myself,,or is it making me someone else?,And how do I feel about itnif it's making me someone else? 
 I had two advantagesnas I went into the fight.,The first is that I knew that,nobjectively speaking,,I had a nice life,,and that if I could only get well,,there was something at the other endnthat was worth living for.,And the other wasnthat I had access to good treatment. 
 But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,,and emerged and relapsed,,and emerged and relapsed,,and finally understood,I would have to be on medicationnand in therapy forever.,And I thought,,"But is it a chemical problemnor a psychological problem?,And does it need a chemical curenor a philosophical cure?",And I couldn't figure out which it was.,And then I understood that actually,,we aren't advanced enough in either areanfor it to explain things fully.,The chemical curenand the psychological cure,both have a role to play,,and I also figured outnthat depression was something,that was braided so deep into us,that there was no separating itnfrom our character and personality. 
 I want to say that the treatments we havenfor depression are appalling.,They're not very effective.,They're extremely costly.,They come with innumerable side effects.,They're a disaster.,But I am so grateful that I live nownand not 50 years ago,,when there would have beennalmost nothing to be done.,I hope that 50 years hence,,people will hear about my treatments,and be appalled that anyone endurednsuch primitive science. 
 Depression is the flaw in love.,If you were marriednto someone and thought,,"Well, if my wife dies,nI'll find another one,",it wouldn't be love as we know it.,There's no such thing as lovenwithout the anticipation of loss,,and that specter of despairncan be the engine of intimacy. 
 There are three thingsnpeople tend to confuse:,depression, grief and sadness.,Grief is explicitly reactive.,If you have a lossnand you feel incredibly unhappy,,and then, six months later,,you are still deeply sad,nbut you're functioning a little better,,it's probably grief,,and it will probably ultimatelynresolve itself in some measure.,If you experience a catastrophic loss,,and you feel terrible,,and six months laternyou can barely function at all,,then it's probably a depressionnthat was triggered,by the catastrophic circumstances.,The trajectory tells us a great deal.,People think of depressionnas being just sadness.,It's much, much too much sadness,,much too much grief,at far too slight a cause. 
 As I set out to understand depression,,and to interview peoplenwho had experienced it,,I found that there were peoplenwho seemed, on the surface,,to have what sounded likenrelatively mild depression,who were nonethelessnutterly disabled by it.,And there were other peoplenwho had what sounded,as they described itnlike terribly severe depression,who nonetheless had good lives,in the intersticesnbetween their depressive episodes.,And I set out to find outnwhat it is that causes some people,to be more resilient than other people.,What are the mechanismsnthat allow people to survive?,And I went out and I interviewednperson after person,who was suffering with depression. 
 One of the first people I interviewed,described depressionnas a slower way of being dead,,and that was a good thingnfor me to hear early on,because it reminded menthat that slow way of being dead,can lead to actual deadness,,that this is a serious business.,It's the leading disability worldwide,,and people die of it every day. 
 One of the people I talked tonwhen I was trying to understand this,was a beloved friendnwho I had known for many years,,and who had had a psychotic episodenin her freshman year of college,,and then plummetedninto a horrific depression.,She had bipolar illness,,or manic depression, as it was then known.,And then she did very wellnfor many years on lithium,,and then eventually,nshe was taken off her lithium,to see how she would do without it,,and she had another psychosis,,and then plunged into the worst depressionnthat I had ever seen,in which she satnin her parents' apartment,,more or less catatonic,nessentially without moving,,day after day after day.,And when I interviewed hernabout that experience some years later --,she's a poet and psychotherapistnnamed Maggie Robbins --,when I interviewed her, she said,,"I was singing 'Where HavenAll The Flowers Gone,',over and over, to occupy my mind.,I was singing to blot outnthe things my mind was saying,,which were, 'You are nothing.nYou are nobody.,You don't even deserve to live.',And that wasnwhen I really started thinking,about killing myself." 
 You don't think in depressionnthat you've put on a gray veil,and are seeing the worldnthrough the haze of a bad mood.,You think that the veilnhas been taken away,,the veil of happiness,,and that now you're seeing truly.,It's easier to helpnschizophrenics who perceive,that there's something foreignninside of them that needs to be exorcised,,but it's difficult with depressives,,because we believenwe are seeing the truth. 
 But the truth lies.,I became obsessed with that sentence:,"But the truth lies.",And I discovered,nas I talked to depressive people,,that they havenmany delusional perceptions.,People will say, "No one loves me.",And you say, "I love you,,your wife loves you,nyour mother loves you.",You can answer that one pretty readily,nat least for most people.,But people who are depressednwill also say,,"No matter what we do,nwe're all just going to die in the end.",Or they'll say,n"There can be no true communion,between two human beings.,Each of us is trapped in his own body.",To which you have to say,,"That's true,,but I think we should focus right nownon what to have for breakfast." 
 (Laughter) 
 A lot of the time,,what they are expressingnis not illness, but insight,,and one comes to thinknwhat's really extraordinary,is that most of us knownabout those existential questions,and they don't distract us very much.,There was a study I particularly liked,in which a group of depressednand a group of non-depressed people,were asked to play a videongame for an hour,,and at the end of the hour,,they were asked how many little monstersnthey thought they had killed.,The depressive group was usually accuratento within about 10 percent,,and the non-depressed people,guessed between 15 and 20 timesnas many little monsters -- 
 (Laughter) 
 as they had actually killed. 
 A lot of people said, when I chosento write about my depression,,that it must be very difficultnto be out of that closet,,to have people know.,They said, "Do peoplentalk to you differently?",I said, "Yes, peoplentalk to me differently.,They talk to me differently insofar,as they start telling menabout their experience,,or their sister's experience,,or their friend's experience.,Things are different because now I know,that depression is the family secretnthat everyone has. 
 I went a few years ago to a conference,,and on Friday of the three-day conference,,one of the participantsntook me aside, and she said,,"I suffer from depressionnand I'm a little embarrassed about it,,but I've been taking this medication,,and I just wanted to ask younwhat you think?",And so I did my best to give hernsuch advice as I could.,And then she said, "You know,nmy husband would never understand this.,He's really the kind of guy to whomnthis wouldn't make any sense,,so, you know, it's just between us.",And I said, "Yes, that's fine.",On Sunday of the same conference,,her husband took me aside, 
 (Laughter) 
 and he said, "My wife wouldn't think,that I was really muchnof a guy if she knew this,,but I've been dealing with this depressionnand I'm taking some medication,,and I wondered what you think?",They were hiding the same medication,in two different placesnin the same bedroom. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said that I thoughtncommunication within the marriage,might be triggeringnsome of their problems. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I was also struck,by the burdensome naturenof such mutual secrecy.,Depression is so exhausting.,It takes up so muchnof your time and energy,,and silence about it,,it really does make the depression worse. 
 And then I began thinking,about all the waysnpeople make themselves better.,I'd started off as a medical conservative.,I thought there were a fewnkinds of therapy that worked,,it was clear what they were --,there was medication,,there were certain psychotherapies,,there was possiblynelectroconvulsive treatment,,and that everything else was nonsense.,But then I discovered something.,If you have brain cancer,,and you say that standing on your headnfor 20 minutes every morning,makes you feel better,,it may make you feel better,nbut you still have brain cancer,,and you'll still probably die from it.,But if you say that you have depression,,and standing on your headnfor 20 minutes every day,makes you feel better, then it's worked,,because depressionnis an illness of how you feel,,and if you feel better,,then you are effectivelynnot depressed anymore.,So I became much more tolerant,of the vast worldnof alternative treatments. 
 And I get letters,nI get hundreds of letters,from people writing to tell menabout what's worked for them.,Someone was asking menbackstage today about meditation.,My favorite of the letters that I gotnwas the one that came from a woman,who wrote and saidnthat she had tried therapy, medication,,she had tried pretty much everything,,and she had found a solutionnand hoped I would tell the world,,and that was makingnlittle things from yarn. 
 (Laughter) 
 She sent me some of them. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm not wearing them right now. 
 (Laughter) 
 I suggested to hernthat she also should look up,obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM. 
 And yet, when I went to looknat alternative treatments,,I also gained perspectivenon other treatments.,I went throughna tribal exorcism in Senegal,that involved a great deal of ram's blood,and that I'm not goingnto detail right now,,but a few years afterwardsnI was in Rwanda,,working on a different project,,and I happened to describenmy experience to someone,,and he said,,"Well, that's West Africa,nand we're in East Africa,,and our rituals arenin some ways very different,,but we do have some rituals,that have something in commonnwith what you're describing.",And he said,,"But we've had a lot of troublenwith Western mental health workers,,especially the ones who camenright after the genocide.",I said, "What kindnof trouble did you have?",And he said, "Well,nthey would do this bizarre thing.,They didn't take people outnin the sunshine,where you begin to feel better.,They didn't include drummingnor music to get people's blood going.,They didn't involve the whole community.,They didn't externalizenthe depression as an invasive spirit.,Instead what they did was they took peoplenone at a time into dingy little rooms,and had them talk for an hour,about bad thingsnthat had happened to them." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 He said, "We had to ask themnto leave the country." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now at the other endnof alternative treatments,,let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.,Frank Russakoff had the worst depressionnperhaps that I've ever seen in a man.,He was constantly depressed.,He was, when I met him,,at a point at which every month,nhe would have electroshock treatment.,Then he would feelnsort of disoriented for a week.,Then he would feel okay for a week.,Then he would have a weeknof going downhill.,And then he would have anothernelectroshock treatment.,And he said to me when I met him,,"It's unbearable to gonthrough my weeks this way.,I can't go on this way,,and I've figured outnhow I'm going to end it,if I don't get better.","But," he said to me,n"I heard about a protocol at Mass General,for a procedure called a cingulotomy,nwhich is a brain surgery,,and I think I'm going to give that a try.",And I remember being amazednat that point to think that someone,who clearly had so many bad experiences,with so many different treatments,still had buried in him,nsomewhere, enough optimism,to reach out for one more.,And he had the cingulotomy,nand it was incredibly successful. 
 He's now a friend of mine.,He has a lovely wifenand two beautiful children.,He wrote me a letternthe Christmas after the surgery,,and he said,,"My father sent me two presents this year,,First, a motorized CD racknfrom The Sharper Image,that I didn't really need,,but I knew he was giving itnto me to celebrate,the fact that I'm living on my ownnand have a job I seem to love.,And the other presentnwas a photo of my grandmother,,who committed suicide.,As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,,and my mother came over and said,,'Are you crying becausenof the relatives you never knew?',And I said, 'She hadnthe same disease I have.',I'm crying now as I write to you.,It's not that I'm so sad,nbut I get overwhelmed,,I think, because I couldnhave killed myself,,but my parents kept me going,nand so did the doctors,,and I had the surgery.,I'm alive and grateful.,We live in the right time,neven if it doesn't always feel like it." 
 I was struck by the fact that depression,is broadly perceived to bena modern, Western, middle-class thing,,and I went to look at how it operatednin a variety of other contexts,,and one of the thingsnI was most interested in,was depression among the indigent.,And so I went out to try to look,at what was being donenfor poor people with depression.,And what I discovered is that poor people,are mostly not beingntreated for depression.,Depression is the resultnof a genetic vulnerability,,which is presumablynevenly distributed in the population,,and triggering circumstances,,which are likely to be more severenfor people who are impoverished.,And yet it turns out that if you havena really lovely life,but feel miserable all the time,,you think, "Why do I feel like this?,I must have depression.",And you set out to find treatment for it.,But if you have a perfectly awful life,,and you feel miserable all the time,,the way you feelnis commensurate with your life,,and it doesn't occur to you to think,,"Maybe this is treatable." 
 And so we have an epidemic in this country,of depression among impoverished people,that's not being picked upnand that's not being treated,and that's not being addressed,,and it's a tragedy of a grand order.,And so I found an academic,who was doing a research projectnin slums outside of D.C.,,where she picked up womennwho had come in for other health problems,and diagnosed them with depression,,and then provided six monthsnof the experimental protocol.,One of them, Lolly, came in,,and this is what she saidnthe day she came in.,She said, and she was a woman,nby the way, who had seven children.,She said, "I used to have a jobnbut I had to give it up,because I couldn't go out of the house.,I have nothing to say to my children.,In the morning,nI can't wait for them to leave,,and then I climb in bednand pull the covers over my head,,and three o'clock when they come home,,it just comes so fast.",She said, "I've been takingna lot of Tylenol,,anything I can takenso that I can sleep more.,My husband has been telling menI'm stupid, I'm ugly.,I wish I could stop the pain." 
 Well, she was broughtninto this experimental protocol,,and when I interviewed hernsix months later,,she had taken a job working in childcare,for the U.S. Navy,nshe had left the abusive husband,,and she said to me,,"My kids are so much happier now.",She said, "There's one roomnin my new place for the boys,and one room for the girls,,but at night, they're justnall up on my bed,,and we're doing homeworknall together and everything.,One of them wants to be a preacher,,one of them wants to be a firefighter,,and one of the girls saysnshe's going to be a lawyer.,They don't cry like they used to,,and they don't fight like they did.,That's all I need now, is my kids.,Things keep on changing,,the way I dress,nthe way I feel, the way I act.,I can go outside not being afraid anymore,,and I don't thinknthose bad feelings are coming back,,and if it weren'tnfor Dr. Miranda and that,,I would still be at homenwith the covers pulled over my head,,if I were still alive at all.,I asked the Lord to send me an angel,,and He heard my prayers." 
 I was really moved by these experiences,,and I decided that I wantednto write about them,not only in a book I was working on,nbut also in an article,,and I got a commissionnfrom The New York Times Magazine,to write about depressionnamong the indigent. 
 And I turned in my story,,and my editor called me and said,n"We really can't publish this." 
 And I said, "Why not?" 
 And she said, "It just is too far-fetched.,These people who are sort ofnat the very bottom rung of society,and then they getna few months of treatment,and they're virtually readynto run Morgan Stanley?,It's just too implausible.",She said, "I've never even heardnof anything like it." 
 And I said, "The factnthat you've never heard of it,is an indication that it is news." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "And you are a news magazine." 
 So after a certain amount of negotiation,nthey agreed to it.,But I think a lot of what they saidnwas connected in some strange way,to this distaste that people still havenfor the idea of treatment,,the notion that somehow if we went out,and treated a lot of peoplenin indigent communities,,that would be exploitative,,because we would be changing them.,There is this false moral imperativenthat seems to be all around us,,that treatment of depression,,the medications and so on,nare an artifice,,and that it's not natural.,And I think that's very misguided.,It would be naturalnfor people's teeth to fall out,,but there is nobody militatingnagainst toothpaste,,at least not in my circles. 
 People then say,,"But isn't depression part of what peoplenare supposed to experience?,Didn't we evolve to have depression?,Isn't it part of your personality?",To which I would say, mood is adaptive.,Being able to have sadness and fear,and joy and pleasure,and all of the other moods that we have,nthat's incredibly valuable.,And major depression,is something that happensnwhen that system gets broken.,It's maladaptive. 
 People will come to me and say,,"I think, though, if I justnstick it out for another year,,I think I can just get through this." 
 And I always say to them,n"You may get through it,,but you'll never be 37 again.,Life is short, and that's a whole yearnyou're talking about giving up.,Think it through." 
 It's a strange povertynof the English language,,and indeed of many other languages,,that we use this same word, depression,,to describe how a kid feelsnwhen it rains on his birthday,,and to describe how somebody feelsnthe minute before they commit suicide. 
 People say to me, "Well, is itncontinuous with normal sadness?",And I say, in a way it's continuousnwith normal sadness.,There is a certain amount of continuity,,but it's the same way there's continuity,between having an iron fencenoutside your house,that gets a little rust spot,that you have to sand offnand do a little repainting,,and what happens if you leaventhe house for 100 years,and it rusts throughnuntil it's only a pile of orange dust.,And it's that orange dust spot,,that orange dust problem,,that's the onenwe're setting out to address. 
 So now people say,,"You take these happy pills,nand do you feel happy?",And I don't.,But I don't feel sadnabout having to eat lunch,,and I don't feel sadnabout my answering machine,,and I don't feel sadnabout taking a shower.,I feel more, in fact, I think,,because I can feelnsadness without nullity.,I feel sad about professionalndisappointments,,about damaged relationships,,about global warming.,Those are the thingsnthat I feel sad about now.,And I said to myself, well,nwhat is the conclusion?,How did those people who have better lives,even with bigger depressionnmanage to get through?,What is the mechanism of resilience? 
 And what I came up with over time,was that the peoplenwho deny their experience,,and say, "I was depressed a long time ago,,I never want to think about it again,,I'm not going to look at it,and I'm just goingnto get on with my life,",ironically, those are the peoplenwho are most enslaved by what they have.,Shutting out the depressionnstrengthens it.,While you hide from it, it grows.,And the people who do better,are the ones who are able to toleratenthe fact that they have this condition.,Those who can tolerate their depressionnare the ones who achieve resilience. 
 So Frank Russakoff said to me,,"If I had a do-over,nI suppose I wouldn't do it this way,,but in a strange way,nI'm grateful for what I've experienced.,I'm glad to have beennin the hospital 40 times.,It taught me so much about love,,and my relationshipnwith my parents and my doctors,has been so precious to me,nand will be always." 
 And Maggie Robbins said,,"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,,and I would just talk and talk and talk,,and the people I was dealing withnweren't very responsive, and I thought,,'That's not very friendlynor helpful of them.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 "And then I realized,,I realized thatnthey weren't going to do more,than make those firstnfew minutes of small talk.,It was simply going to be an occasion,where I didn't have AIDSnand I wasn't dying,,but could tolerate the fact that they did,and they were.,Our needs are our greatest assets.,It turns out I've learned to givenall the things I need." 
 Valuing one's depressionndoes not prevent a relapse,,but it may make the prospect of relapse,and even relapse itselfneasier to tolerate.,The question is not so muchnof finding great meaning,and deciding your depressionnhas been very meaningful.,It's of seeking that meaningnand thinking, when it comes again,,"This will be hellish,nbut I will learn something from it.",I have learned in my own depression,how big an emotion can be,,how it can be more real than facts,,and I have found that that experience,has allowed me to experiencenpositive emotion,in a more intense and more focused way.,The opposite of depressionnis not happiness,,but vitality,,and these days, my life is vital,,even on the days when I'm sad.,I felt that funeral in my brain,,and I sat next to the colossusnat the edge of the world,,and I have discoverednsomething inside of myself,that I would have to call a soul,that I had never formulatednuntil that day 20 years ago,when hell came to pay me a surprise visit. 
 I think that while I hated being depressed,and would hate to be depressed again,,I've found a way to love my depression.,I love it because it has forced mento find and cling to joy.,I love it because each day I decide,,sometimes gamely,,and sometimes against the moment's reason,,to cleave to the reasons for living.,And that, I think,nis a highly privileged rapture. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may be wondering,why a marine biologist from Oceana,would come here today to talk to you,about world hunger.,I'm here today because,saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.,It's more than a thing we're doing,because we want to create jobs for fishermen,or preserve fishermen's jobs.,It's more than an economic pursuit.,Saving the oceans can feed the world.,Let me show you how. 
 As you know, there are already,more than a billion hungry people on this planet.,We're expecting that problem to get worse,as world population grows to nine billion,or 10 billion by midcentury,,and we can expect to have greater pressure,on our food resources.,And this is a big concern,,especially considering where we are now.,Now we know that our arable land per capita,is already on the decline,in both developed and developing countries.,We know that we're headed for climate change,,which is going to change rainfall patterns,,making some areas drier, as you can see in orange,,and others wetter, in blue,,causing droughts in our breadbaskets,,in places like the Midwest and Central Europe,,and floods in others.,It's going to make it harder for the land,to help us solve the hunger problem.,And that's why the oceans neednto be their most abundant,,so that the oceans can provide us,as much food as possible. 
 And that's something the oceans have been doing,for us for a long time.,As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase,in the amount of food we've been able to harvest,from our oceans.,It just seemed like it was continuing to increase,,until about 1980,,when we started to see a decline.,You've heard of peak oil.,Maybe this is peak fish.,I hope not. I'm going to come back to that.,But you can see about an 18-percent decline,in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch,since 1980.,And this is a big problem. It's continuing.,This red line is continuing to go down. 
 But we know how to turn it around,,and that's what I'm going to talk about today.,We know how to turn that curve back upwards.,This doesn't have to be peak fish.,If we do a few simple things in targeted places,,we can bring our fisheries back and use them,to feed people. 
 First we want to know where the fish are,,so let's look where the fish are.,It turns out the fish, conveniently,,are located for the most part,in our coastal areas of the countries,,in coastal zones,,and these are areas that national jurisdictions,have control over,,and they can manage their fisheries,in these coastal areas.,Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions,that go out about 200 nautical miles,,in areas that are called exclusive economic zones,,and this is a good thing that they can control,their fisheries in these areas,,because the high seas,,which are the darker areas on this map,,the high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,,because it has to be done internationally.,You get into international agreements,,and if any of you are trackingnthe climate change agreement,,you know this can be a very slow,,frustrating, tedious process.,And so controlling things nationally,is a great thing to be able to do. 
 How many fish are actually in these coastal areas,compared to the high seas?,Well, you can see here about,seven times as many fish in the coastal areas,than there are in the high seas,,so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,,because we can actually get a lot done.,We can restore a lot of our fisheries,if we focus in these coastal areas. 
 But how many of these countriesndo we have to work in?,There's something like 80 coastal countries.,Do we have to fix fisheries management,in all of those countries?,So we asked ourselves, how many countries,do we need to focus on,,keeping in mind that the European Union,conveniently manages its fisheries,through a common fisheries policy?,So if we got good fisheries management,in the European Union and,nsay, nine other countries,,how much of our fisheries would we be covering?,Turns out, European Union plus nine countries,covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.,If we took it up to 24 countriesnplus the European Union,,we would up to 90 percent,,almost all of the world's fish catch.,So we think we can work inna limited number of places,to make the fisheries come back.,But what do we have to do in these places?,Well, based on our work in the United States,and elsewhere, we know that there are,three key things we have to do,to bring fisheries back, and they are:,We need to set quotas or limits,on how much we take;,we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental,catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,,and it's very wasteful;,and three, we need to protect habitats,,the nursery areas, the spawning areas,that these fish need to grownand reproduce successfully,so that they can rebuild their populations.,If we do those three things, we nknow the fisheries will come back. 
 How do we know?,We know because we've seen it happening,in a lot of different places.,This is a slide that shows,the herring population in Norway,that was crashing since the 1950s.,It was coming down, and when Norway set limits,,or quotas, on its fishery, what happens?,The fishery comes back.,This is another example, alsonhappens to be from Norway,,of the Norwegian Arctic cod.,Same deal. The fishery is crashing.,They set limits on discards.,Discards are these fish they weren't targeting,and they get thrown overboard wastefully.,When they set the discard limit,,the fishery came back.,And it's not just in Norway.,We've seen this happening in countries,all around the world, time and time again.,When these countries step in and they,put in sustainable fisheries management policies,,the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,,are starting to come back.,So there's a lot of promise here. 
 What does this mean for the world fish catch?,This means that if we take that fishery catch,that's on the decline,and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it,up to 100 million metric tons per year.,So we didn't have peak fish yet.,We still have an opportunity,to not only bring the fish back,but to actually get more fish,that can feed more people,than we currently are now.,How many more? Right about now,,we can feed about 450 million people,a fish meal a day,based on the current world fish catch,,which, of course, you know is going down,,so that number will go down over time,if we don't fix it,,but if we put fishery management practices,like the ones I've described in place,in 10 to 25 countries,,we could bring that number up,and feed as many as 700 million people a year,a healthy fish meal. 
 We should obviously do this just because,it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,,but it's also cost-effective.,It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein,on the planet.,If you look at how much fish protein you get,per dollar invested,compared to all of the other animal proteins,,obviously, fish is a good business decision.,It also doesn't need a lot of land,,something that's in short supply,,compared to other protein sources.,And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.,It uses a lot less fresh water than,,for example, cattle,,where you have to irrigate a field,so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.,It also has a very low carbon footprint.,It has a little bit of a carbon footprint,because we do have to get out and catch the fish.,It takes a little bit of fuel,,but as you know, agriculturencan have a carbon footprint,,and fish has a much smaller one,,so it's less polluting.,It's already a big part of our diet,,but it can be a bigger part of our diet,,which is a good thing, because we know,that it's healthy for us.,It can reduce our risks of cancer,,heart disease and obesity.,In fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,,who is the originator of this concept, actually,,he likes to say fish is the perfect protein.,Andy also talks about the fact that,our ocean conservation movement really grew,out of the land conservation movement,,and in land conservation,,we have this problem where biodiversity,is at war with food production.,You have to cut down the biodiverse forest,if you want to get the field,to grow the corn to feed people with,,and so there's a constant push-pull there.,There's a constant tough decision,that has to be made between,two very important things:,maintaining biodiversity and feeding people.,But in the oceans, we don't have that war.,In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war,with abundance.,In fact, they're aligned.,When we do things that produce biodiversity,,we actually get more abundance,,and that's important so that we can feed people. 
 Now, there's a catch. 
 Didn't anyone get that? (Laughter) 
 Illegal fishing.,Illegal fishing undermines the type of,sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.,It can be when you catch fish using gears,that have been prohibited,,when you fish in places wherenyou're not supposed to fish,,you catch fish that are the wrongnsize or the wrong species.,Illegal fishing cheats the consumer,and it also cheats honest fishermen,,and it needs to stop.,The way illegal fish get into our nmarket is through seafood fraud.,You might have heard about this.,It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.,Think about the last time you had fish.,What were you eating?,Are you sure that's what it was?,Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples,and about a third of them,were not what they were labeled to be.,Snappers, nine out of 10nsnappers were not snapper.,Fifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested,was mislabeled.,And red snapper, we tested 120 samples,,and only seven of them were really red snapper,,so good luck finding a red snapper. 
 Seafood has a really complex supply chain,,and at every step in this supply chain,,there's an opportunity for seafood fraud,,unless we have traceability.,Traceability is a way where the seafood industry,can track the seafood from the boat to the plate,to make sure that the consumer can then find out,where their seafood came from. 
 This is a really important thing.,It's being done by some innthe industry, but not enough,,so we're pushing a law in Congress,called the SAFE Seafood Act,,and I'm very excited today to announce the release,of a chef's petition, where 450 chefs,have signed a petition calling on Congress,to support the SAFE Seafood Act.,It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know --,Anthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,,Barton Seaver and others —,and they've signed it because they believe,that people have a right to know,about what they're eating. 
 (Applause) 
 Fishermen like it too, so there's a good chance,we can get the kind of support we need,to get this bill through,,and it comes at a critical time,,because this is the way we stop seafood fraud,,this is the way we curb illegal fishing,,and this is the way we make sure,that quotas, habitat protection,,and bycatch reductions can do the jobs,they can do. 
 We know that we can managenour fisheries sustainably.,We know that we can produce,healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people,that don't use the land, that don't use much water,,have a low carbon footprint,,and are cost-effective.,We know that saving the oceans,can feed the world,,and we need to start now. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause)So I'm here to talk to younabout the walkable city.,What is the walkable city?,Well, for want of a better definition,,it's a city in which the carnis an optional instrument of freedom,,rather than a prosthetic device.,And I'd like to talk aboutnwhy we need the walkable city,,and I'd like to talk aboutnhow to do the walkable city. 
 Most of the talks I give these daysnare about why we need it,,but you guys are smart.,And also I gave that talknexactly a month ago,,and you can see it at TED.com.,So today I want to talknabout how to do it.,In a lot of time thinking about this,,I've come up with what I callnthe general theory of walkability.,A bit of a pretentious term,nit's a little tongue-in-cheek,,but it's somethingnI've thought about for a long time,,and I'd like to sharenwhat I think I've figured out. 
 In the American city,nthe typical American city --,the typical American citynis not Washington, DC,,or New York, or San Francisco;,it's Grand Rapids or CedarnRapids or Memphis --,in the typical American citynin which most people own cars,and the temptationnis to drive them all the time,,if you're going to get them to walk,nthen you have to offer a walk,that's as good as a drive or better.,What does that mean?,It means you need to offernfour things simultaneously:,there needs to be a proper reason to walk,,the walk has to be safe and feel safe,,the walk has to be comfortable,and the walk has to be interesting.,You need to do all fournof these things simultaneously,,and that's the structure of my talk today,,to take you through each of those. 
 The reason to walknis a story I learned from my mentors,,Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,,the founders of the New Urbanism movement.,And I should say half the slidesnand half of my talk today,I learned from them.,It's the story of planning,,the story of the formationnof the planning profession.,When in the 19th centurynpeople were choking,from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,,the planners said, hey, let's moventhe housing away from the mills.,And lifespans increasednimmediately, dramatically,,and we like to say,the planners have been trying to repeatnthat experience ever since. 
 So there's the onsetnof what we call Euclidean zoning,,the separation of the landscapeninto large areas of single use.,And typically when I arrivenin a city to do a plan,,a plan like this already awaits menon the property that I'm looking at.,And all a plan like this guarantees,is that you will not have a walkable city,,because nothing is locatednnear anything else.,The alternative, of course,nis our most walkable city,,and I like to say, you know,nthis is a Rothko,,and this is a Seurat.,It's just a different way --nhe was the pointilist --,it's a different way of making places.,And even this map of Manhattannis a bit misleading,because the red colornis uses that are mixed vertically. 
 So this is the big storynof the New Urbanists --,to acknowledgenthat there are only two ways,that have been tested by the thousands,to build communities,nin the world and throughout history.,One is the traditional neighborhood.,You see here several neighborhoodsnof Newburyport, Massachusetts,,which is defined as being compactnand being diverse --,places to live, work, shop,nrecreate, get educated --,all within walking distance.,And it's defined as being walkable.,There are lots of small streets.,Each one is comfortable to walk on.,And we contrast that to the other way,,an invention that happenednafter the Second World War,,suburban sprawl,,clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,nand it's not walkable,,because so few of the streets connect,,that those streets that do connectnbecome overburdened,,and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.,And I want to thank Alex Maclean,nthe aerial photographer,,for many of these beautiful picturesnthat I'm showing you today. 
 So it's fun to break sprawl downninto its constituent parts.,It's so easy to understand,,the places where you only live,nthe places where you only work,,the places where you only shop,,and our super-sized public institutions.,Schools get bigger and bigger,,and therefore, furthernand further from each other.,And the ratio of the sizenof the parking lot,to the size of the school,tells you all you need to know,,which is that no childnhas ever walked to this school,,no child will ever walk to this school.,The seniors and juniors are drivingnthe freshmen and the sophomores,,and of course we haventhe crash statistics to prove it. 
 And then the super-sizingnof our other civic institutions,like playing fields --,it's wonderful that Westinnin the Ft. Lauderdale area,has eight soccer fieldsnand eight baseball diamonds,and 20 tennis courts,,but look at the roadnthat takes you to that location,,and would you let your child bike on it?,And this is why we haventhe soccer mom now.,When I was young, I had one soccer field,,one baseball diamond and one tennis court,,but I could walk to it,nbecause it was in my neighborhood. 
 Then the final part of sprawlnthat everyone forgot to count:,if you're going to separate everythingnfrom everything else,and reconnect itnonly with automotive infrastructure,,then this is what your landscapenbegins to look like.,The main message here is:,if you want to have a walkable city,nyou can't start with the sprawl model.,you need the bones of an urban model.,This is the outcomenof that form of design,,as is this.,And this is somethingnthat a lot of Americans want.,But we have to understandnit's a two-part American dream.,If you're dreaming for this,,you're also going to be dreaming of this,noften to absurd extremes,,when we build our landscapento accommodate cars first.,And the experiencenof being in these places -- 
 (Laughter) 
 This is not Photoshopped.,Walter Kulash took this slide.,It's in Panama City.,This is a real place.,And being a driverncan be a bit of a nuisance,,and being a pedestrianncan be a bit of a nuisance,in these places.,This is a slide that epidemiologistsnhave been showing for some time now, 
 (Laughter) 
 The fact that we have a societynwhere you drive to the parking lot,to take the escalator to the treadmill,shows that we're doing something wrong.,But we know how to do it better. 
 Here are the two models contrasted.,I show this slide,,which has been a formative documentnof the New Urbanism now,for almost 30 years,,to show that sprawl and the traditionalnneighborhood contain the same things.,It's just how big are they,,how close are they to each other,,how are they interspersed together,and do you have a street network,nrather than a cul-de-sac,or a collector system of streets? 
 So when we look at a downtown area,,at a place that has a hopenof being walkable,,and mostly that's our downtownsnin America's cities,and towns and villages,,we look at them and saynwe want the proper balance of uses.,So what is missing or underrepresented?,And again, in the typical American citiesnin which most Americans live,,it is housing that is lacking.,The jobs-to-housing balance is off.,And you find that whennyou bring housing back,,these other things start to come back too,,and housing is usually firstnamong those things.,And, of course, the thingnthat shows up last and eventually,is the schools,,because the people have to move in,,the young pioneers have to move in,nget older, have kids,and fight, and then the schoolsnget pretty good eventually. 
 The other part of this part,,the useful city part,,is transit,,and you can have a perfectlynwalkable neighborhood without it.,But perfectly walkable citiesnrequire transit,,because if you don't have accessnto the whole city as a pedestrian,,then you get a car,,and if you get a car,,the city begins to reshape itselfnaround your needs,,and the streets get widernand the parking lots get bigger,and you no longer have a walkable city.,So transit is essential.,But every transit experience,nevery transit trip,,begins or ends as a walk,,and so we have to remember to buildnwalkability around our transit stations. 
 Next category, the biggest one,nis the safe walk.,It's what most walkabilitynexperts talk about.,It is essential, but alone not enoughnto get people to walk.,And there are so many moving partsnthat add up to a walkable city. 
 The first is block size.,This is Portland, Oregon,,famously 200-foot blocks,nfamously walkable.,This is Salt Lake City,,famously 600-foot blocks,,famously unwalkable.,If you look at the two,nit's almost like two different planets,,but these places were both built by humans,and in fact, the story is that whennyou have a 200-foot block city,,you can have a two-lane city,,or a two-to-four lane city,,and a 600-foot block citynis a six-lane city, and that's a problem.,These are the crash statistics.,When you double the block size --,this was a studynof 24 California cities --,when you double the block size,,you almost quadruplenthe number of fatal accidents,on non-highway streets. 
 So how many lanes do we have?,This is where I'm going to tell younwhat I tell every audience I meet,,which is to remind younabout induced demand.,Induced demand appliesnboth to highways and to city streets.,And induced demand tells usnthat when we widen the streets,to accept the congestionnthat we're anticipating,,or the additional tripsnthat we're anticipating,in congested systems,nit is principally that congestion,that is constraining demand,,and so that the widening comes,,and there are all of these latent tripsnthat are ready to happen.,People move further from work,and make other choicesnabout when they commute,,and those lanes fill upnvery quickly with traffic,,so we widen the street again,nand they fill up again.,And we've learned thatnin congested systems,,we cannot satisfy the automobile. 
 This is from Newsweek Magazine --nhardly an esoteric publication:,"Today's engineers acknowledge,that building new roadsnusually makes traffic worse.",My response to reading this was,nmay I please meet some of these engineers,,because these are not the ones that I --,there are great exceptionsnthat I'm working with now --,but these are not the engineersnone typically meets working in a city,,where they say, "Oh, that roadnis too crowded, we need to add a lane.",So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,,and they say, "See, I told younwe needed that lane.",This applies both to highwaysnand to city streets if they're congested. 
 But the amazing thingnabout most American cities that I work in,,the more typical cities,,is that they have a lot of streetsnthat are actually oversized,for the congestionnthey're currently experiencing.,This was the case in Oklahoma City,,when the mayor came runningnto me, very upset,,because they were namednin Prevention Magazine,the worst city for pedestriansnin the entire country.,Now that can't possibly be true,,but it certainly is enoughnto make a mayor do something about it.,We did a walkability study,,and what we found, lookingnat the car counts on the street --,these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts,and we know that two lanesncan handle 10,000 cars per day.,Look at these numbers --nthey're all near or under 10,000 cars,,and these were the streetsnthat were designated,in the new downtown plan,to be four lanes to six lanes wide.,So you had a fundamental disconnectnbetween the number of lanes,and the number of carsnthat wanted to use them. 
 So it was my job to redesignnevery street in the downtown,from curb face to curb face,,and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,,and we're rebuilding it now.,So a typical oversized street to nowhere,is being narrowed, and nownunder construction,,and the project is half done.,The typical street like this, you know,,when you do that,nyou find room for medians.,You find room for bike lanes.,We've doubled the amountnof on-street parking.,We've added a full bike networknwhere one didn't exist before. 
 But not everyone has the moneynthat Oklahoma City has,,because they have an extractionneconomy that's doing quite well.,The typical city is morenlike Cedar Rapids,,where they have an all four-lanensystem, half one-way system.,And it's a little hard to see,,but what we've done -- what we're doing;nit's in process right now,,it's in engineering right now --,is turning an all four-lanensystem, half one-way,into an all two-lane system, all two-way,,and in so doing, we're addingn70 percent more on-street parking,,which the merchants love,,and it protects the sidewalk.,That parking makes the sidewalk safe,,and we're adding a much morenrobust bicycle network. 
 Then the lanes themselves.nHow wide are they?,That's really important.,The standards have changednsuch that, as Andrés Duany says,,the typical roadnto a subdivision in America,allows you to seenthe curvature of the Earth. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a subdivisionnoutside of Washington from the 1960s.,Look very carefullynat the width of the streets.,This is a subdivision from the 1980s.,1960s, 1980s.,The standards have changednto such a degree,that my old neighborhood of South Beach,,when it was time to fix the streetnthat wasn't draining properly,,they had to widen itnand take away half our sidewalk,,because the standards were wider.,People go faster on wider streets.,People know this.,The engineers deny it,nbut the citizens know it,,so that in Birmingham, Michigan,nthey fight for narrower streets.,Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,,instituted its "Skinny Streets" programnin its residential neighborhood.,We know that skinny streets are safer.,The developer Vince Graham,nin his project I'On,,which we worked on in South Carolina,,he goes to conferences and he showsnhis amazing 22-foot roads.,These are two-way roads,nvery narrow rights of way,,and he shows this well-known philosopher,,who said, "Broad is the roadnthat leads to destruction ...,narrow is the road that leads to life." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This plays very well in the South. 
 Now: bicycles.,Bicycles and bicyclingnare the current revolution underway,in only some American cities.,But where you build it, they come.,As a planner, I hate to say that,nbut the one thing I can say,is that bicycle populationnis a function of bicycle infrastructure.,I asked my friend Tom Brennannfrom NelsonNygaard in Portland,to send me some picturesnof the Portland bike commute.,He sent me this. I said,n"Was that bike to work day?",He said, "No, that was Tuesday.",When you do what Portland did and spendnmoney on bicycle infrastructure --,New York City has doubled the numbernof bikers in it several times now,by painting these bright green lanes.,Even automotive citiesnlike Long Beach, California:,vast uptick in the number of bikersnbased on the infrastructure.,And of course, what really does it,,if you know 15th Streetnhere in Washington, DC --,please meet Rahm Emanuel'snnew bike lanes in Chicago,,the buffered lane, the parallel parkingnpulled off the curb,,the bikes between the parkedncars and the curb --,these mint cyclists.,If, however, as in Pasadena,nevery lane is a bike lane,,then no lane is a bike lane.,And this is the only bicyclistnthat I met in Pasadena, so ... 
 (Laughter) 
 The parallel parking I mentioned --,it's an essential barrier of steel,that protects the curb and pedestriansnfrom moving vehicles.,This is Ft. Lauderdale;none side of the street, you can park,,the other side of the street, you can't.,This is happy hour on the parking side.,This is sad hour on the other side.,And then the trees themselvesnslow cars down.,They move slower when treesnare next to the road,,and, of course, sometimesnthey slow down very quickly.,All the little details --nthe curb return radius.,Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?,How swoopy is that curb to determinenhow fast the car goes,and how much room you have to cross.,And then I love this,nbecause this is objective journalism.,"Some say the entrance to CityCenternis not inviting to pedestrians.",When every aspectnof the landscape is swoopy,,is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,,it says: "This is a vehicular place.",So no one detail, no one speciality,ncan be allowed to set the stage.,And here, you know, this street:,yes, it will drain within a minutenof the hundred-year storm,,but this poor womannhas to mount the curb every day. 
 So then quickly, the comfortable walknhas to do with the fact,that all animals seek, simultaneously,nprospect and refuge.,We want to be able to see our predators,,but we also want to feelnthat our flanks are covered.,And so we're drawn to placesnthat have good edges,,and if you don't supply the edges,npeople won't want to be there.,What's the proper rationof height to width?,Is it one to one? Three to one?,If you get beyond one to six,nyou're not very comfortable anymore.,You don't feel enclosed.,Now, six to one in Salzburgncan be perfectly delightful.,The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.,The point being the parking lotnis the principal problem here.,However, missing teeth, those empty lotsncan be issues as well,,and if you have a missing cornernbecause of an outdated zoning code,,then you could have a missing nosenin your neighborhood.,That's what we had in my neighborhood.,This was the zoning code that saidnI couldn't build on that site.,As you may know, Washington, DCnis now changing its zoning,to allow sites like thisnto become sites like this.,We needed a lot of variances to do that.,Triangular housesncan be interesting to build,,but if you get one built,npeople generally like it.,So you've got to fill those missing noses. 
 And then, finally, the interesting walk:,signs of humanity.,We are among the social primates.,Nothing interests us morenthan other people.,We want signs of people.,So the perfect one-to-one ratio,nit's a great thing.,This is Grand Rapids,na very walkable city,,but nobody walks on this street,that connects the twonbest hotels together,,because if on the left,nyou have an exposed parking deck,,and on the right,nyou have a conference facility,that was apparently designednin admiration for that parking deck,,then you don't attract that many people.,Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term,nMayor of Charleston, South Carolina,,taught us it only takesn25 feet of building,to hide 250 feet of garage.,This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.nIt's in South Beach.,That active ground floor. 
 I want to end with this projectnthat I love to show.,It's by Meleca Architects.nIt's in Columbus, Ohio.,To the left is the convention centernneighborhood, full of pedestrians.,To the right is the Short Northnneighborhood -- ethnic,,great restaurants,ngreat shops, struggling.,It wasn't doing very wellnbecause this was the bridge,,and no one was walkingnfrom the convention center,into that neighborhood.,Well, when they rebuilt the highway,nthey added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.,Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridgenover the highway.,The city paid 1.9 million dollars,,they gave the site to a developer,,the developer built this,and now the Short Northnhas come back to life.,And everyone says, the newspapers,nnot the planning magazines,,the newspapers saynit's because of that bridge. 
 So that's it. That's the generalntheory of walkability.,Think about your own cities.,Think about how you can apply it.,You've got to do all four things at once.,So find those placesnwhere you have most of them,and fix what you can,,fix what still needs fixingnin those places. 
 I really appreciate your attention,,and thank you for coming today. 
 (Applause)Sarge Salman: All the way fromnLos Altos Hills, California,,Mr. Henry Evans. 
 (Applause) 
 Henry Evans: Hello.,My name is Henry Evans,,and until August 29, 2002,,I was living my version of the American dream.,I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.,My dad was a lawyer.,My mom was a homemaker.,My six siblings and I were good kids,,but caused our fair share of trouble.,After high school, I left home to study,and learn more about the world.,I went to Notre Dame University,and graduated with degreesnin accounting and German,,including spending a year of study in Austria.,Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.,I married my high school sweetheart, Jane.,I am lucky to have her.,Together, we raised four wonderful children.,I worked and studied hardnto move up the career ladder,,eventually becoming a chief financial officer,in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.,My family and I bought our first and only home,on December 13, 2001,,a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot,of Los Altos Hills, California,,from where I am speaking to you now. 
 We were looking forward to rebuilding it,,but eight months after we moved in,,I suffered a stroke-like attackncaused by a birth defect.,Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic,at the ripe old age of 40.,It took me several years,,but with the help of an incredibly supportive family,,I finally decided life was still worth living.,I became fascinated with using technology,to help the severely disabled.,Head tracking devices sold commercially,by the company Madentec,convert my tiny head movementsninto cursor movements,,and enable my use of a regular computer.,I can surf the web, exchange email with people,,and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins,in online word games.,This technology allows me to remain engaged,,mentally active,,and feel like I am a part of the world. 
 One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,,when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp,of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech,demonstrating a PR2 robot.,I emailed Charlie andnSteve Cousins of Willow Garage,,and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.,For about two years, Robots for Humanity,developed ways for me to use the PR2,as my body surrogate.,I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.,From my home in California,,I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter),I handed out Halloween candy.,I opened my refrigerator on my own.,I began doing tasks around the house.,I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities,to live and contribute,,both for myself and others in my circumstance. 
 All of us have disabilities in one form or another.,For example, if either of usnwants to go 60 miles an hour,,both of us will need an assistive device called a car.,Your disability doesn't make younany less of a person,,and neither does mine.,By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter),Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability,to fly on our own. 
 Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage,connected with me Chad Jenkins.,Chad showed me how easy it is,to purchase and fly aerial drones.,It was then I realized that I could also use,an aerial drone to expand the worlds,of bedridden people through flight,,giving a sense of movement and control,that is incredible.,Using a mouse cursor I control with my head,,these web interfaces allow me,to see video from the robot,and send control commands,by pressing buttons in a web browser.,With a little practice, I becamengood enough with this interface,to drive around my home on my own.,I could look around our garden,and see the grapes we are growing.,I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter),One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone,on our basketball hoop.,I went even further by seeing if I could use,a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,,as modified by Fighting Walrus,,to have an immersive experience,controlling the drone.,With Chad's group at Brown,,I regularly fly drones around his lab,several times a week,nfrom my home 3,000 miles away.,All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,,so we also find time to play friendly games,of robot soccer. (Laughter),I never thought I would be able to casually,move around a campus like Brown on my own.,I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter) 
 Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,,I bet all of these people here,would love to see you fly this drone,from your bed in California 3,000 miles away. 
 (Applause) 
 Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately? 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic? 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Can you show us how excited you are? 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, big finish.,Can you show us how good of a pilot you are? 
 (Applause) 
 All right, we still have a little ways to go with that,,but I think it shows the promise. 
 What makes Henry's story amazing,is it's about understanding Henry's needs,,understanding what people in Henry's situation,need from technology,,and then also understanding,what advanced technology can provide,,and then bringing those two things together,for use in a wise and responsible way.,What we're trying to do is democratize robotics,,so that anybody can be a part of this.,We're providing affordable,noff-the-shelf robot platforms,such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,,the Suitable Technologies beam,nonly 17,000 dollars,,along with open-source robotics software,so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.,And our hope is that, by providing these tools,,that you'll be able to think of better ways,to provide movement for the disabled,,to provide care for our aging population,,to help better educate our children,,to think about what the new types,of middle class jobs could be for the future,,to both monitor and protect our environment,,and to explore the universe. 
 Back to you, Henry. 
 HE: Thank you, Chad. 
 With this drone setup, we show the potential,for bedridden people to once again be able,to explore the outside world,,and robotics will eventually provide,a level playing field,where one is only limited by their mental acuity,and imagination,,where the disabled are able to perform,the same activities as everyone else,,and perhaps better,,and technology will even allow us to provide,an outlet for many people who are presently,considered vegetables.,One hundred years ago,,I would have been treated like a vegetable.,Actually, that's not true.,I would have died. 
 It is up to us, all of us, to decide how,robotics will be used, for good or for evil,,for simply replacing people,or for making people better,,for allowing us to do and enjoy more. 
 Our goal for robotics is tonunlock everyone's mental power,by making the world more physically accessible,to people such as myself and others like me,around the globe.,With the help of people like you,,we can make this dream a reality. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The two most likely largest inventions,of our generation,are the Internet and the mobile phone.,They've changed the world.,However, largely to our surprise,,they also turned out to be the perfect tools,for the surveillance state.,It turned out that the capability,to collect data, information and connections,about basically any of us and all of us,is exactly what we've been hearing,throughout of the summernthrough revelations and leaks,about Western intelligence agencies,,mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,,watching over the rest of the world. 
 We've heard about these starting with the,revelations from June 6.,Edward Snowden started leaking information,,top secret classified information,,from the U.S. intelligence agencies,,and we started learning about things like PRISM,and XKeyscore and others.,And these are examples of the kinds of programs,U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,,against the whole rest of the world. 
 And if you look back about the forecasts,on surveillance by George Orwell,,well it turns out that,George Orwell was an optimist.,(Laughter),We are right now seeing a much larger scale,of tracking of individual citizens,than he could have ever imagined. 
 And this here is the infamous,NSA data center in Utah.,Due to be opened very soon,,it will be both a supercomputing center,and a data storage center.,You could basically imagine it has a large hall,filled with hard drives storing data,they are collecting.,And it's a pretty big building.,How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --,140,000 square meters --,but that doesn't really tell you very much.,Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.,You think about the largest IKEA store,you've ever been in.,This is five times larger.,How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?,Right? It's pretty big.,We estimate that just the electricity bill,for running this data center,is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.,And this kind of wholesale surveillance,means that they can collect our data,and keep it basically forever,,keep it for extended periods of time,,keep it for years, keep it for decades.,And this opens up completely new kinds of risks,to us all.,And what this is is that it is wholesale,blanket surveillance on everyone. 
 Well, not exactly everyone,,because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right,to monitor foreigners.,They can monitor foreigners,when foreigners' data connections,end up in the United States or passnthrough the United States.,And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad,until you realize,that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.,In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners. 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? 
 So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,,all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet. 
 But don't get me wrong:,There are actually typesnof surveillance that are okay.,I love freedom, but even I agree,that some surveillance is fine.,If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,,or they're trying to catch a drug lord,or trying to prevent a school shooting,,and they have leads and they have suspects,,then it's perfectly fine for themnto tap the suspect's phone,,and to intercept his Internet communications.,I'm not arguing that at all,,but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.,They are not about doing surveillance on people,that they have reasonnto suspect of some wrongdoings.,They're about doing surveillance on people,they know are innocent. 
 So the four main arguments,supporting surveillance like this,,well, the first of all is that whenever you start,discussing about these revelations,,there will be naysayers trying to minimize,the importance of these revelations, saying that,we knew all this already,,we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.,And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you,that we knew this already,nbecause we did not know this already.,Our worst fears might have been something like this,,but we didn't know this was happening.,Now we know for a fact it's happening.,We didn't know about this.nWe didn't know about PRISM.,We didn't know about XKeyscore.nWe didn't know about Cybertrans.,We didn't know about DoubleArrow.,We did not know about Skywriter --,all these different programs,run by U.S. intelligence agencies.,But now we do. 
 And we did not know,that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes,such as infiltrating standardization bodies,to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.,And what that means,is that you take something which is secure,,an encryption algorithm which is so secure,that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,,nobody can decrypt that file.,Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,,it's going to take millions of years.,So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.,You take something which is that good,and then you weaken it on purpose,,making all of us less secure as an end result.,A real-world equivalent would be that,intelligence agencies would force,some secret pin code into every single house alarm,so they could get into every single house,because, you know, bad peoplenmight have house alarms,,but it will also make all of us,less secure as an end result.,Backdooring encryption algorithms,just boggles the mind.,But of course, these intelligence agenciesnare doing their job.,This is what they have been told to do:,do signals intelligence,,monitor telecommunications,,monitor Internet traffic.,That's what they're trying to do,,and since most, a very big partnof the Internet traffic today is encrypted,,they're trying to find ways around the encryption.,One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,,which is a great example,about how U.S. intelligence agencies,are running loose.,They are completely out of control,,and they should be brought back under control. 
 So what do we actually know about the leaks?,Everything is based on the files,leaked by Mr. Snowden.,The very first PRISM slides,from the beginning of June,detail a collection program where the data,is collected from service providers,,and they actually go and name the service providers,they have access to.,They even have a specific date,on when the collection of data began,for each of the service providers.,So for example, they namenthe collection from Microsoft,started on September 11, 2007,,for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,,and then others: Google, Facebook,,Skype, Apple and so on. 
 And every single one of these companies denies.,They all say that this simply isn't true,,that they are not givingnbackdoor access to their data.,Yet we have these files.,So is one of the parties lying,,or is there some other alternative explanation?,And one explanation would be,that these parties, these service providers,,are not cooperating.,Instead, they've been hacked.,That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.,In this case, they've been hackednby their own government.,That might sound outlandish,,but we already have cases where this has happened,,for example, the case of the Flame malware,which we strongly believe was authored,by the U.S. government,,and which, to spread, subverted the security,of the Windows Update network,,meaning here, the company was hacked,by their own government.,And there's more evidence,supporting this theory as well.,Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information,about the operations run by the elite hacker units,operating inside these intelligence agencies.,Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO,,Tailored Access Operations,,and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,,it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.,And these recent leaks of these three slides,detail an operation,run by this GCHQ intelligence agency,from the United Kingdom,targeting a telecom here in Belgium.,And what this really means,is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency,is breaching the security,of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,,and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,,business as usual.,Here's the primary target,,here's the secondary target,,here's the teaming.,They probably have a team buildingnon Thursday evening in a pub.,They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art,like, you know, "Success,",when they gain access to services like this.,What the hell? 
 And then there's the argument,that okay, yes, this might be going on,,but then again, other countries are doing it as well.,All countries spy.,And maybe that's true.,Many countries spy, not all of them,nbut let's take an example.,Let's take, for example, Sweden.,I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden,has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.,When your data traffic goes through Sweden,,their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law,to intercept that traffic.,All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers,and politicians and business leaders,use, every day, U.S.-based services,,like, you know, run Windows or OSX,,or use Facebook or LinkedIn,,or store their data in clouds like iCloud,or Skydrive or DropBox,,or maybe use online services likenAmazon web services or sales support?,And the answer is, every single Swedishnbusiness leader does that every single day.,And then we turn it around.,How many American leaders,use Swedish webmails and cloud services?,And the answer is zero.,So this is not balanced.,It's not balanced by any means, not even close. 
 And when we do have the occasional,European success story,,even those, then, typically end up being soldnto the United States.,Like, Skype used to be secure.,It used to be end-to-end encrypted.,Then it was sold to the United States.,Today, it no longer is secure.,So once again, we take something which is secure,and then we make it less secure on purpose,,making all of us less secure as an outcome. 
 And then the argument that the United States,is only fighting terrorists.,It's the war on terror.,You shouldn't worry about it.,Well, it's not the war on terror.,Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,,there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,,and we should fight them,,but we know through these leaks,that they have used the same techniques,to listen to phone calls of European leaders,,to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,,to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,,and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists,from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?,It's not the war on terror.,Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,,but are we really thinking about terrorists,as such an existential threat,that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?,Are the Americans readynto throw away the Constituion,and throw it in the trashnjust because there are terrorists?,And the same thing with the Bill of Rightsnand all the amendments,and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,and the E.U. conventions on human rightsnand fundamental freedoms,and the press freedom?,Do we really think terrorismnis such an existential threat,,we are ready to do anything at all? 
 But people are scared about terrorists,,and then they think thatnmaybe that surveillance is okay,because they have nothing to hide.,Feel free to survey me if that helps.,And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide,simply hasn't thought about this long enough. 
 (Applause) 
 Because we have this thing called privacy,,and if you really think that you have nothing to hide,,please make sure that's the first thing you tell me,,because then I know,that I should not trust you with any secrets,,because obviously you can't keep a secret.,But people are brutally honest with the Internet,,and when these leaks started,,many people were asking me about this.,And I have nothing to hide.,I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.,Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular,like to share with an intelligence agency,,especially a foreign intelligence agency.,And if we indeed need a Big Brother,,I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother,than a foreign Big Brother.,And when the leaks started,nthe very first thing I tweeted about this,was a comment about how,,when you've been using search engines,,you've been potentially leaking all thatnto U.S. intelligence.,And two minutes later, I got a reply,by somebody called Kimberly from the United States,challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?,What am I sending to worry about this?nAm I sending naked pictures or something?,And my answer to Kimberly was,that what I'm sending is none of your business,,and it should be nonenof your government's business either.,Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.,Privacy is nonnegotiable.,It should be built in to all the systems we use. 
 (Applause) 
 And one thing we should all understand,is that we are brutally honest with search engines.,You show me your search history,,and I'll find something incriminating,or something embarrassing there in five minutes.,We are more honest with search engines,than we are with our families.,Search engines know more about you,than your family members know about you.,And this is all the kindnof information we are giving away,,we are giving away to the United States. 
 And surveillance changes history.,We know this through examplesnof corrupt presidents like Nixon.,Imagine if he would have had the kindnof surveillance tools that are available today.,And let me actually quote,the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.,She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.,Her email was read, and she spoke,at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,,"If there is no right to privacy,,there can be no true freedomnof expression and opinion,,and therefore, there can be no effective democracy." 
 That's what it's about.,Privacy is the building block of our democracies.,And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,,he said that the United Statesnis right now treating the Internet,as it would be treating one of its colonies.,So we are back to the age of colonization,,and we, the foreign users of the Internet,,we should think about Americans as our masters. 
 So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.,Some are blaming him for causing problems,for the U.S. cloud industrynand software companies with these revelations --,and blaming Snowden for causing problemsnfor the U.S. cloud industry,would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore,for causing global warming. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, what is there to be done?,Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.,We should be angry, because this is wrong,,and it's rude, and it should not be done.,But that's not going to really change the situation.,What's going to change the situationnfor the rest of the world,is to try to steer away,from systems built in the United States.,And that's much easier said than done.,How do you do that?,A single country, any single country in Europe,cannot replace and build replacements,for the U.S.-made operating systemsnand cloud services. 
 But maybe you don't have to do it alone.,Maybe you can do it together with other countries.,The solution is open source.,By building together open, free, secure systems,,we can go around such surveillance,,and then one country doesn't havento solve the problem by itself.,It only has to solve one little problem.,And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,,one country only has to make a small wave,,but those small waves together become a tide,,and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,,and the tide we will build,with secure, free, open-source systems,,will become the tide that will lift all of us,up and above the surveillance state. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)In 2007, I became the attorney general,of the state of New Jersey.,Before that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,,first in the Manhattan district attorney's office,,and then at the United States Department of Justice. 
 But when I became the attorney general,,two things happened that changed nthe way I see criminal justice.,The first is that I asked what I thought,were really basic questions.,I wanted to understand who we were arresting,,who we were charging,,and who we were putting in our nation's jails,and prisons.,I also wanted to understand,if we were making decisions,in a way that made us safer.,And I couldn't get this information out.,It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies,like my own,didn't track the things that matter.,So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,,I walked down into a conference room,that was filled with detectives,and stacks and stacks of case files,,and the detectives were sitting there,with yellow legal pads taking notes.,They were trying to get the information,I was looking for,by going through case by case,for the past five years.,And as you can imagine,,when we finally got the results, they weren't good.,It turned out that we were doing,a lot of low-level drug cases,on the streets just around the corner,from our office in Trenton. 
 The second thing that happened,is that I spent the day in the Camden,nNew Jersey police department.,Now, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,,was the most dangerous city in America.,I ran the Camden PolicenDepartment because of that.,I spent the day in the police department,,and I was taken into a roomnwith senior police officials,,all of whom were working hard,and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.,And what I saw in that room,,as we talked about how to reduce crime,,were a series of officers with anlot of little yellow sticky notes.,And they would take a yellow stickynand they would write something on it,and they would put it up on a board.,And one of them said, n"We had a robbery two weeks ago.,We have no suspects.",And another said, "We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.",We weren't using data-driven policing.,We were essentially trying to fight crime,with yellow Post-it notes. 
 Now, both of these things made me realize,fundamentally that we were failing.,We didn't even know who wasnin our criminal justice system,,we didn't have any data aboutnthe things that mattered,,and we didn't share data or use analytics,or tools to help us make better decisions,and to reduce crime.,And for the first time, I started to think,about how we made decisions.,When I was an assistant D.A.,,and when I was a federal prosecutor,,I looked at the cases in front of me,,and I generally made decisions based on my instinct,and my experience.,When I became attorney general,,I could look at the system as a whole,,and what surprised me is that I found,that that was exactly how we were doing it,across the entire system --,in police departments, in prosecutors's offices,,in courts and in jails.,And what I learned very quickly,is that we weren't doing a good job.,So I wanted to do things differently.,I wanted to introduce data and analytics,and rigorous statistical analysis,into our work.,In short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice. 
 Now, moneyball, as many of you know,,is what the Oakland A's did,,where they used smart data and statistics,to figure out how to pick players,that would help them win games,,and they went from a system that nwas based on baseball scouts,who used to go out and watch players,and use their instinct and experience,,the scouts' instincts and experience,,to pick players, from one to use,smart data and rigorous statistical analysis,to figure out how to pick playersnthat would help them win games. 
 It worked for the Oakland A's,,and it worked in the state of New Jersey.,We took Camden off the top of the list,as the most dangerous city in America.,We reduced murders there by 41 percent,,which actually means 37 lives were saved.,And we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.,We also changed the waynwe did criminal prosecutions.,So we went from doing low-level drug crimes,that were outside our building,to doing cases of statewide importance,,on things like reducing violencenwith the most violent offenders,,prosecuting street gangs,,gun and drug trafficking, and political corruption. 
 And all of this matters greatly,,because public safety to me,is the most important function of government.,If we're not safe, we can't be educated,,we can't be healthy,,we can't do any of the other thingsnwe want to do in our lives.,And we live in a country today,where we face serious criminal justice problems.,We have 12 million arrests every single year.,The vast majority of those arrests,are for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,,70 to 80 percent.,Less than five percent of all arrests,are for violent crime.,Yet we spend 75 billion,,that's b for billion,,dollars a year on state and local corrections costs.,Right now, today, we have 2.3 million people,in our jails and prisons.,And we face unbelievable public safety challenges,because we have a situation,in which two thirds of the people in our jails,are there waiting for trial.,They haven't yet been convicted of a crime.,They're just waiting for their day in court.,And 67 percent of people come back.,Our recidivism rate is amongst nthe highest in the world.,Almost seven in 10 people who are released,from prison will be rearrested,in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration. 
 So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,,I came back to looking at a lot of these questions,,and I came back to thinking about how,we had used data and analytics to transform,the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.,And when I look at the criminal justice system,in the United States today,,I feel the exact same way that I did,about the state of New Jersey when I started there,,which is that we absolutely have to do better,,and I know that we can do better. 
 So I decided to focus,on using data and analytics,to help make the most critical decision,in public safety,,and that decision is the determination,of whether, when someone has been arrested,,whether they pose a risk to public safety,and should be detained,,or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety,and should be released.,Everything that happens in criminal cases,comes out of this one decision.,It impacts everything.,It impacts sentencing.,It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.,It impacts crime and violence.,And when I talk to judges around the United States,,which I do all the time now,,they all say the same thing,,which is that we put dangerous people in jail,,and we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.,They mean it and they believe it.,But when you start to look at the data,,which, by the way, the judges don't have,,when we start to look at the data,,what we find time and time again,,is that this isn't the case.,We find low-risk offenders,,which makes up 50 percent of ournentire criminal justice population,,we find that they're in jail.,Take Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man,who stole four blankets on a cold winter night.,He was arrested, and he was kept in jail,on 3,500 dollars bail,,an amount that he could not afford to pay.,And he stayed in jail for eight months,until his case came up for trial,,at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.,And at the other end of the spectrum,,we're doing an equally terrible job.,The people who we find,are the highest-risk offenders,,the people who we think have the highest likelihood,of committing a new crime if they're released,,we see nationally that 50 percent of those people,are being released. 
 The reason for this is the way we make decisions.,Judges have the best intentions,when they make these decisions about risk,,but they're making them subjectively.,They're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago,who were using their instinct and their experience,to try to decide what risk someone poses.,They're being subjective,,and we know what happensnwith subjective decision making,,which is that we are often wrong.,What we need in this space,are strong data and analytics. 
 What I decided to look for,was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,,something that would let judges actually understand,with a scientific and objective way,what the risk was that was posed,by someone in front of them.,I looked all over the country,,and I found that between five and 10 percent,of all U.S. jurisdictions,actually use any type of risk assessment tool,,and when I looked at these tools,,I quickly realized why.,They were unbelievably expensive to administer,,they were time-consuming,,they were limited to the local jurisdiction,in which they'd been created.,So basically, they couldn't be scaled,or transferred to other places. 
 So I went out and built a phenomenal team,of data scientists and researchers,and statisticians,to build a universal risk assessment tool,,so that every single judge innthe United States of America,can have an objective, scientific measure of risk.,In the tool that we've built,,what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases,from all around the United States,,from cities, from counties,,from every single state in the country,,the federal districts.,And with those 1.5 million cases,,which is the largest data set on pretrial,in the United States today,,we were able to basically find that there were,900-plus risk factors that we could look at,to try to figure out what mattered most.,And we found that there were nine specific things,that mattered all across the country,and that were the most highly predictive of risk.,And so we built a universal risk assessment tool.,And it looks like this.,As you'll see, we put some information in,,but most of it is incredibly simple,,it's easy to use,,it focuses on things like thendefendant's prior convictions,,whether they've been sentenced to incarceration,,whether they've engaged in violence before,,whether they've even failed to come back to court.,And with this tool, we can predict three things.,First, whether or not someone will commit,a new crime if they're released.,Second, for the first time,,and I think this is incredibly important,,we can predict whether someone will commit,an act of violence if they're released.,And that's the single most important thing,that judges say when you talk to them.,And third, we can predict whether someone,will come back to court.,And every single judge in thenUnited States of America can use it,,because it's been created on a universal data set. 
 What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool,is this -- it's a dashboard.,At the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,,six of course being the highest,,and then in the middle younsee, "Elevated risk of violence.",What that says is that this person,is someone who has an elevated risk of violence,that the judge should look twice at.,And then, towards the bottom,,you see the Failure to Appear Score,,which again is the likelihood,that someone will come back to court. 
 Now I want to say something really important.,It's not that I think we should be eliminating,the judge's instinct and experience,from this process.,I don't.,I actually believe the problem that we see,and the reason that we haventhese incredible system errors,,where we're incarceratingnlow-level, nonviolent people,and we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people,,is that we don't have an objective measure of risk.,But what I believe should happen,is that we should take thatndata-driven risk assessment,and combine that with thenjudge's instinct and experience,to lead us to better decision making.,The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,,and we're about to go up in annumber of other U.S. jurisdictions.,Our goal, quite simply, is that every single judge,in the United States will use a data-driven risk tool,within the next five years.,We're now working on risk tools,for prosecutors and for police officers as well,,to try to take a system that runs today,in America the same way it did 50 years ago,,based on instinct and experience,,and make it into one that runs,on data and analytics. 
 Now, the great news about all this,,and we have a ton of work left to do,,and we have a lot of culture to change,,but the great news about all of it,is that we know it works.,It's why Google is Google,,and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball,to win games.,The great news for us as well,is that it's the way that we can transform,the American criminal justice system.,It's how we can make our streets safer,,we can reduce our prison costs,,and we can make our system much fairer,and more just.,Some people call it data science.,I call it moneyballing criminal justice. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student,living two lives.,In one, I used NASA supercomputers,to design next-generation spacecraft,,and in the other I was a data scientist,looking for potential smugglers,of sensitive nuclear technologies.,As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,,mostly of facilities,,industrial facilities around the world.,And I was always looking for a better canvas,to tie these all together.,And one day, I was thinking about how,all data has a location,,and I realized that the answer,had been staring me in the face.,Although I was a satellite engineer,,I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery,in my work. 
 Now, like most of us, I'd been online,,I'd see my house, so I thought,,I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up,some of these facilities.,And what I found really surprised me.,The pictures that I was finding,were years out of date,,and because of that,,it had relatively little relevance,to the work that I was doing today.,But I was intrigued.,I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.,There are millions and millions of sensors,surrounding us today,,but there's still so much wendon't know on a daily basis.,How much oil is stored in all of China?,How much corn is being produced?,How many ships are in all of our world's ports?,Now, in theory, all of these questions,could be answered by imagery,,but not if it's old.,And if this data was so valuable,,then how come I couldn't get my hands,on more recent pictures? 
 So the story begins over 50 years ago,with the launch of the first generation,of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.,And today, there's a handful,of the great, great grandchildren,of these early Cold War machines,which are now operated by private companies,and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery,that you and I see on a daily basis comes.,During this period, launching things into space,,just the rocket to get the satellite up there,,has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,,and that's created tremendous pressure,to launch things infrequently,and to make sure that when you do,,you cram as much functionality in there as possible.,All of this has only made satellites,bigger and bigger and bigger,and more expensive,,now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.,Because they are so expensive,,there aren't very many of them.,Because there aren't very many of them,,the pictures that we see on a daily basis,tend to be old. 
 I think a lot of people actuallynunderstand this anecdotally,,but in order to visualize just how sparsely,our planet is collected,,some friends and I put together a dataset,of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered,by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.,As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world,are barely seen, less than once a year,,and even the areas that are seen most frequently,,those in red, are seen at best once a quarter.,Now as aerospace engineering grad students,,this chart cried out to us as a challenge.,Why do these things have to be so expensive?,Does a single satellite really have to cost,the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?,Wasn't there a way to build a smaller,,simpler, new satellite design that could enable,more timely imaging? 
 I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy,that we were going to go out and just,begin designing satellites,,but fortunately we had help.,In the late 1990s, a couple of professors,proposed a concept for radically reducing the price,of putting things in space.,This was hitchhiking small satellites,alongside much larger satellites.,This dropped the cost of putting objects up there,by over a factor of 100,,and suddenly we could afford to experiment,,to take a little bit of risk,,and to realize a lot of innovation.,And a new generation of engineers and scientists,,mostly out of universities,,began launching these very small,,breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.,And these were built with electronics obtained,from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin. 
 Now it was using the lessonsnlearned from these early missions,that my friends and I began a series of sketches,of our own satellite design.,And I can't remember a specific day,where we made a conscious decision,that we were actually going tongo out and build these things,,but once we got that idea in our minds,of the world as a dataset,,of being able to capture millions of data points,on a daily basis describing the global economy,,of being able to unearth billions of connections,between them that had never before been found,,it just seemed boring,to go work on anything else. 
 And so we moved into a cramped,,windowless office in Palo Alto,,and began working to take our design,from the drawing board into the lab.,The first major question we had to tackle,was just how big to build this thing.,In space, size drives cost,,and we had worked with these very small,,breadbox-sized satellites in school,,but as we began to betternunderstand the laws of physics,,we found that the quality of pictures,those satellites could take was very limited,,because the laws of physics dictate,that the best picture youncan take through a telescope,is a function of the diameter of that telescope,,and these satellites had a very small,,very constrained volume.,And we found that the best picture we would,have been able to get looked something like this.,Although this was the low-cost option,,quite frankly it was just too blurry,to see the things that makensatellite imagery valuable.,So about three or four weeks later,,we met a group of engineers randomly,who had worked on the first,private imaging satellite ever developed,,and they told us that back in the 1970s,,the U.S. government had found a powerful,optimal tradeoff --,that in taking pictures at rightnabout one meter resolution,,being able to see objects one meter in size,,they had found that they could notnjust get very high-quality images,,but get a lot of them at an affordable price.,From our own computer simulations,,we quickly found that one meter really was,the minimum viable product,to be able to see the drivers of our global economy,,for the first time, being able to count,the ships and cars and shippingncontainers and trucks,that move around our world on a daily basis,,while conveniently still notnbeing able to see individuals.,We had found our compromise.,We would have to build something larger,than the original breadbox,,now more like a mini-fridge,,but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.,So now we had our constraint.,The laws of physics dictated,the absolute minimum-sizedntelescope that we could build. 
 What came next was making the rest of the satellite,as small and as simple as possible,,basically a flying telescope with four walls,and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book,that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.,The big challenge became actually taking,the pictures through that telescope.,Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,,similar to a Xerox machine,,and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,,scanning row by row by row,to build the complete image.,Now people use these because they get a lot of light,,which means less of the noise you see,in a low-cost cell phone image.,The problem with them is they require,very sophisticated pointing.,You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target,from over 600 miles away,while moving at more thannseven kilometers a second,,which requires an awesome degree of complexity.,So instead, we turned to a newngeneration of video sensors,,originally created for use in night vision goggles.,Instead of taking a single, high quality image,,we could take a videostream,of individually noisier frames,,but then we could recombine,all of those frames together,into very high-quality images,using sophisticated pixel processing techniques,here on the ground,,at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.,And we applied this technique,to many of the other systems on the satellite as well,,and day by day, our design evolved,from CAD to prototypes,to production units. 
 A few short weeks ago,,we packed up SkySat 1,,put our signatures on it,,and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.,Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration,ready to blast off in a few short weeks.,And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching,a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites,and beginning to build the scalable analytics,that will allow us to unearth the insights,in the petabytes of data we will collect. 
 So why do all of this? Why build these satellites?,Well, it turns out imaging satellites,have a unique ability to provide global transparency,,and providing that transparency on a timely basis,is simply an idea whose time has come.,We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,,and beyond economic data,,unlocking the human story, moment by moment.,For a data scientist,that just happened to go to space camp as a kid,,it just doesn't get much better than that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Einstein said that,"I never think about the future —nit comes soon enough." 
 And he was right, of course.,So today, I'm here to ask you to think of,how the future is happening now.,Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced,two major waves of innovation.,First, the Industrial Revolution,brought us machines and factories, railways,,electricity, air travel,,and our lives have never been the same.,Then the Internet revolution,brought us computing power, data networks,,unprecedented access,to information and communication,,and our lives have never been the same. 
 Now we are experiencing,another metamorphic change:,the industrial Internet.,It brings together intelligent machines,,advanced analytics,,and the creativity of people at work.,It's the marriage of minds and machines.,And our lives will never be the same. 
 In my current role, I see up close,how technology is beginning to transform,industrial sectors that play a huge role,in our economy and in our lives:,energy, aviation, transportation, health care.,For an economist, this is highly unusual,,and it's extremely exciting,,because this is a transformation,as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,,and before the Industrial Revolution,,there was no economic growth to speak of. 
 So what is this industrial Internet?,Industrial machines are being equipped,with a growing number of electronic sensors,that allow them to see, hear, feel,a lot more than ever before,,generating prodigious amounts of data.,Increasingly sophisticated analytics,then sift through the data,,providing insights that allow us,to operate the machines in entirely new ways,,a lot more efficiently.,And not just individual machines,,but fleets of locomotives, airplanes,,entire systems like power grids, hospitals.,It is asset optimization and system optimization.,Of course, electronic sensors,have been around for some time,,but something has changed:,a sharp decline in the cost of sensors,and, thanks to advances in cloud computing,,a rapid decrease in the cost of storing,and processing data. 
 So we are moving to a world,where the machines we work with,are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.,They are self-aware, they are predictive,,reactive and social.,It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,,medical devices, communicating seamlessly,with each other and with us.,It's a world where information itself,becomes intelligent and comes to us,automatically when we need it,without having to look for it.,We are beginning to deploy,throughout the industrial system,embedded virtualization,,multi-core processor technology,,advanced cloud-based communications,,a new software-defined machine infrastructure,which allows machine functionality,to become virtualized in software,,decoupling machine software from hardware,,and allowing us to remotely and automatically,monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets. 
 Why does any of this matter at all?,Well first of all, it's already allowing us,to shift towards preventive,,condition-based maintenance,,which means fixing machines,just before they break,,without wasting time,servicing them on a fixed schedule.,And this, in turn, is pushing us towards,zero unplanned downtime,,which means there will be no more power outages,,no more flight delays. 
 So let me give you a few examples,of how these brilliant machines work,,and some of the examples may seem trivial,,some are clearly more profound,,but all of them are going tonhave a very powerful impact. 
 Let's start with aviation.,Today, 10 percent of all flights,cancellations and delays,are due to unscheduled maintenance events.,Something goes wrong unexpectedly.,This results in eight billion dollars in costs,for the airline industry globally every year,,not to mention the impact on all of us:,stress, inconvenience,,missed meetings as we sit helplessly,in an airport terminal.,So how can the industrial Internet help here?,We've developed a preventive maintenance system,which can be installed on any aircraft.,It's self-learning and able to predict issues,that a human operator would miss.,The aircraft, while in flight,,will communicate with technicians on the ground.,By the time it lands, they will already know,if anything needs to be serviced.,Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent,over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,,helping seven million passengers,get to their destinations on time. 
 Or take healthcare.,Today, nurses spend an average,of 21 minutes per shift,looking for medical equipment.,That seems trivial, but it's less time spent,caring for patients.,St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,,which has deployed industrial Internet technology,to electronically monitor and connect,patients, staff and medical equipment,,has reduced bed turnaround times,by nearly one hour.,If you need surgery, one hour matters.,It means more patients can be treated,,more lives can be saved.,Another medical center, in Washington state,,is piloting an application that allows,medical images from city scanners and MRIs,to be analyzed in the cloud,,developing better analytics,at a lower cost.,Imagine a patient,who has suffered a severe trauma,,and needs the attention of several specialists:,a neurologist, a cardiologist,,an orthopedic surgeon.,If all of them can have instantaneousnand simultaneous access,to scans and images as they are taken,,they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.,So all of this translates into better health outcomes,,but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.,Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies,could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars,to the healthcare industry worldwide,,and that is just a drop in the sea,compared to what we need to do to make healthcare,affordable on a sustainable basis. 
 Similar advances are happening in energy,,including renewable energy.,Wind farms equipped with newnremote monitorings and diagnostics,that allow wind turbines to talk to each other,and adjust the pitch of theirnblades in a coordinated way,,depending on how the wind is blowing,,can now produce electricity at a cost,of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.,Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents,,six times as much. 
 The list goes on, and it will grow fast,,because industrial data arennow growing exponentially.,By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent,of all digital information. 
 But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears,and tell you how this is impacting already,the jobs we do every day,,because this new wave of innovation,is bringing about new tools and applications,that will allow us to collaborate,in a smarter and faster way,,making our jobs not just more efficient,but more rewarding.,Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm,with a handheld device telling her,which turbines need servicing.,She already has all the spare parts,,because the problems were diagnosed in advanced.,And if she faces an unexpected issue,,the same handheld device will allow her to,communicate with colleagues at the service center,,let them see what she sees,,transmit data that they can run through diagnostics,,and they can stream videos that will guide her,,step by step, through whatever complex procedure,is needed to get the machines back up and running.,And their interaction gets documented,and stored in a searchable database. 
 Let's stop and think about this for a minute,,because this is a very important point.,This new wave of innovation is fundamentally,changing the way we work.,And I know that many of you will be concerned nabout the impact that innovation might have on jobs.,Unemployment is already high,,and there is always a fear nthat innovation will destroy jobs.,And innovation is disruptive.,But let me stress two things here.,First, we've already lived through,mechanization of agriculture,nautomation of industry,,and employment has gone up,,because innovation is fundamentally about growth.,It makes products more affordable.,It creates new demand, new jobs.,Second, there is a concern that in the future,,there will only be room for engineers,,data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.,And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.,But think about it:,Just as a child can easily figure out,how to operate an iPad,,so a new generation of mobile and intuitive,industrial applications will make life easier,for workers of all skill levels.,The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man,than the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times.",And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:,mechanical digital engineers who understand,both the machines and the data;,managers who understand their industry,and the analytics and can reorganize the business,to take full advantage of the technology. 
 But now let's take a step back.,Let's look at the big picture.,There are people who argue that today's innovation,is all about social media and silly games,,with nowhere near the transformational power,of the Industrial Revolution.,They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations,are behind us.,And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that,even back in the Stone Age,,there must have been a group of cavemen,sitting around a fire one day,looking very grumpy,,and looking disapprovinglynat another group of cavemen,rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,,and saying to each other,,"Yeah, this wheel thing,,cool toy, sure, but compared to fire,,it will have no impact.,The big discoveries are all behind us.",(Laughter) 
 This technological revolution,is as inspiring and transformational,as anything we have ever seen.,Human creativity and innovationnhave always propelled us forward.,They've created jobs.,They've raised living standards.,They've made our lives,healthier and more rewarding.,And the new wave of innovation,which is beginning to sweep through industry,is no different.,In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet,could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent,over the next 15 years,,boosting growth to rates wenhaven't seen in a long time,,and adding between 10 and 15ntrillion dollars to global GDP.,That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today. 
 But this is not a foregone conclusion.,We are just at the beginning of this transformation,,and there will be barriers to break,,obstacles to overcome.,We will need to invest in the new technologies.,We will need to adapt organizationsnand managerial practices.,We will need a robust cybersecurity approach,that protects sensitive informationnand intellectual property,and safeguards critical infrastructurenfrom cyberattacks.,And the education system will need to evolve,to ensure students are equipped with the right skills.,It's not going to be easy,,but it is going to be worth it.,The economic challenges facing us are hard,,but when I walk the factory floor,,and I see how humans and brilliant machines,are becoming interconnected,,and I see the difference this makes,in a hospital, in an airport,,in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,,I'm enthusiastic.,This new technological revolution is upon us. 
 So think about the future —nit will be here soon enough. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What makes a great leader today?,Many of us carry this image,of this all-knowing superhero,who stands and commands,and protects his followers.,But that's kind of an image from another time,,and what's also outdated,are the leadership development programs,that are based on success models,for a world that was, not a world that is,or that is coming. 
 We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,,and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness,of your leadership development programs.,Fifty-eight percent of the companies,cited significant talent gaps,for critical leadership roles.,That means that despitencorporate training programs,,off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,,more than half the companies,had failed to grow enough great leaders.,You may be asking yourself,,is my company helping me to prepare,to be a great 21st-century leader?,The odds are, probably not. 
 Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life,observing what makes great leaders.,I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,,I've advised over 200 CEOs,,and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines,than you can imagine.,But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend,in leadership preparation.,I noticed that, despite all the efforts,,there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing,about individuals.,One story was about Chris,,a high-potential, superstar leader,who moves to a new unit and fails,,destroying unrecoverable value.,And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,,who was so frustrated,because her company is cited,as a best company for leaders,,but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped,to lead their crucial initiatives.,And then there were stories,like the senior leadership team,of a once-thriving business,that's surprised by a market shift,,finds itself having to force the company,to reduce its size in half,or go out of business. 
 Now, these recurring stories,cause me to ask two questions.,Why are the leadership gaps widening,when there's so much more investment,in leadership development?,And what are the great leaders doing,distinctly different to thrive and grow?,One of the things that I did,,I was so consumed by these questions,and also frustrated by those stories,,that I left my job,so that I could study this full time,,and I took a year to travel,to different parts of the world,to learn about effective and ineffective,leadership practices in companies,,countries and nonprofit organizations.,And so I did things like travel to South Africa,,where I had an opportunity to understand,how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time,in anticipating and navigating,his political, social and economic context.,I also met a number of nonprofit leaders,who, despite very limited financial resources,,were making a huge impact in the world,,often bringing together seeming adversaries.,And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries,trying to understand how the environment,had shaped the leaders,,the moves that they made,,and then the impact of those moves,beyond their tenure.,And then, when I returned to work full time,,in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues,who were also interested in these questions. 
 Now, from all this, I distilled,the characteristics of leaders who are thriving,and what they do differently,,and then I also distilled,the preparation practices that enable people,to grow to their potential.,I want to share some of those with you now. 
 ("What makes a great leader in the 21st century?") 
 In a 21st-century world, which is more global,,digitally enabled and transparent,,with faster speeds of information nflow and innovation,,and where nothing big gets done,without some kind of a complex matrix,,relying on traditional development practices,will stunt your growth as a leader.,In fact, traditional assessments,like narrow 360 surveys ornoutdated performance criteria,will give you false positives,,lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared,than you really are.,Leadership in the 21st century is defined,and evidenced by three questions. 
 Where are you looking,to anticipate the next change,to your business model or your life?,The answer to this question is on your calendar.,Who are you spending time with? On what topics?,Where are you traveling? What are you reading?,And then how are you distilling this,into understanding potential discontinuities,,and then making a decision to do something,right now so that you're prepared and ready?,There's a leadership team that does a practice,where they bring together each member,collecting, here are trends that impact me,,here are trends that impact another team member,,and they share these,,and then make decisions,nto course-correct a strategy,or to anticipate a new move.,Great leaders are not head-down.,They see around corners,,shaping their future, not just reacting to it. 
 The second question is,,what is the diversity measure,of your personal and professionalnstakeholder network?,You know, we hear often about ngood ol' boy networks,and they're certainly alive and nwell in many institutions.,But to some extent, we all have a network,of people that we're comfortable with.,So this question is about your capacity,to develop relationships with people,that are very different than you.,And those differences can be biological,,physical, functional, political, ncultural, socioeconomic.,And yet, despite all these differences,,they connect with you,and they trust you enough,to cooperate with you,in achieving a shared goal.,Great leaders understand,that having a more diverse network,is a source of pattern identification,at greater levels and also of solutions,,because you have people that are thinking,differently than you are. 
 Third question: are you courageous enough,to abandon a practice that has nmade you successful in the past?,There's an expression: Go along to get along.,But if you follow this advice,,chances are as a leader,,you're going to keep doingnwhat's familiar and comfortable.,Great leaders dare to be different.,They don't just talk about risk-taking,,they actually do it.,And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that,the most impactful development comes,when you are able to build the emotional stamina,to withstand people telling you that your new idea,is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid.,Now interestingly, the people who will join you,are not your usual suspects in your network.,They're often people that think differently,and therefore are willing to join you,in taking a courageous leap.,And it's a leap, not a step.,More than traditional leadership programs,,answering these three questions,will determine your effectiveness,as a 21st-century leader. 
 So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?,I've met many, and they stand out.,They are women and men,who are preparing themselves,not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday,but also for the realities of today,and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Music),For any of you who have visitednor lived in New York City,,these shots might start to look familiar.,This is Central Park,,one of the most beautifully designed,public spaces in America.,But to anyone who hasn't visited,,these images can't really fully convey.,To really understand Central Park,,you have to physically be there.,Well, the same is true of the music,,which my brother and I composed and mapped,specifically for Central Park.,(Music) 
 I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work,that my brother Hays and I are doing --,That's us there. That's both of us actually —,specifically about a concept that we've beenndeveloping over the last few years,,this idea of location-aware music. 
 Now, my brother and I, we're musicians,and music producers.,We've been working together since,,well, since we were kids, really.,But recently, we've becomenmore and more interested,in projects where art,and technology intersect,,from creating sight-specific audio,and video installation,to engineering interactive concerts. 
 But today I want to focus on this concept,of composition for physical space. 
 But before I go too much further into that,,let me tell you a little bit about how we got started,with this idea.,My brother and I were living in New York City,when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude,did their temporary installation, The Gates,,in Central Park.,Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures,decorated the park for a number of weeks,,and unlike work that's exhibited,in a more neutral space,,like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,,this was work that was really in dialogue,with this place,,and in a lot of ways, The Gates,was really a celebration,of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.,This was an experience that stayed with us,for a long time, and years later,,my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,,and we started to ask the question,,would it be possible,,in the same way that The Gates,responded to the physical layout of the park,,to compose music for a landscape?,Which brought us to this. 
 (Music) 
 On Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,",a location-aware album,released exclusively as a mobile app,that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality,to sonically map the entire park,in our hometown of Washington, D.C.,Hundreds of musical segments,are geo-tagged throughout the entire park,so that as a listener traverses the landscape,,a musical score is actually unfolding around them.,So this is not a playlist or a list of songs,intended for the park,,but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms,that fit together like pieces of a puzzle,and blend seamlessly,based on a listener's chosen trajectory.,So think of this as,a choose-your-own-adventure of an album. 
 Let's take a closer look.,Let's look at one example here.,So using the app,,as you make your way towards the grounds,surrounding the Washington Monument,,you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,,which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron,spelling out a very simple melody.,This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.,Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,,until you finally reach the top of the hill,and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks,and all sorts of musical craziness,,as if all of these sounds are radiating out,from this giant obelisk that punctuates,the center of the park.,But were you to walk in the opposite direction,,this entire sequence happens in reverse.,And were you to actually exitnthe perimeter of the park,,the music would fade to silence,,and the play button would disappear. 
 We're sometimes contacted by npeople in other parts of the world,who can't travel to the United States,,but would like to hear this record.,Well, unlike a normal album,,we haven't been able to accommodate this request.,When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,,we just can't make that happen,,and the reason is because,this isn't a promotional app,or a game to promote or accompany,the release of a traditional record.,In this case, the app is the work itself,,and the architecture of the landscape,is intrinsic to the listening experience. 
 Six months later, we did a location-aware album,for Central Park,,a park that is over two timesnthe size of the National Mall,,with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow,to the Ramble to the Reservoir. 
 Currently, my brother and I are working on,projects all over the country,,but last spring we started a project,,here actually at Stanford's,Experimental Media Art Department,,where we're creating our largestnlocation-aware album to date,,one that will span the entirety of Highway 1,here on the Pacific Coast. 
 But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,,is really just one idea.,But it speaks to a larger vision,for a music industry that's sometimes struggled,to find its footing in this digital age,,that they begin to see these new technologies,not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles,to an existing model,,but to dream up entirely new ways,for people to interact with,and experience music. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Thirteen years ago,,we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.,After some success,,we've hit a big hurdle.,The aftermath of the financial crisis,has begun to hit aid payments,,which have fallen for two consecutive years.,My question is whether the lessons learned,from saving the financial system,can be used to help us overcome that hurdle,and help millions.,Can we simply print money for aid? 
 "Surely not.",It's a common reaction.,(Laughter),It's a quick talk.,Others channel John McEnroe.,"You cannot be serious!" 
 Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,,thanks to these two children,,who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart,of my talk.,On the left, we have Pia.,She lives in England.,She has two loving parents,,one of whom is standing right here.,Dorothy, on the right,,lives in rural Kenya.,She's one of 13,000 orphans,and vulnerable children,who are assisted by a charity that I support.,I do that because I believe,that Dorothy, like Pia,,deserves the best life chances,that we can afford to give her.,You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.,The U.N. agrees too.,Their overriding aim,for international aid,is to strive for a life of dignity for all. 
 But -- and here's that hurdle --,can we afford our aid aspirations?,History suggests not.,In 1970, governments set themselves a target,to increase overseas aid payments,to 0.7 percent,of their national income.,As you can see, a big gap opens up,between actual aid and that target.,But then come the Millennium Development Goals,,eight ambitious targets,to be met by 2015.,If I tell you that just one of those targets,is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,,you get a sense of the ambition.,There's also been some success.,The number of people living,on less than $1.25 a day has halved.,But a lot remains to be done in two years.,One in eight remain hungry.,In the context of this auditorium,,the front two rows aren't going to get any food.,We can't settle for that,,which is why the concern about the eighth goal,,which relates to funding,,which I said at the beginning is falling,,is so troubling. 
 So what can be done?,Well, I work in financial markets,,not development.,I study the behavior of investors,,how they react to policy and the economy.,It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.,But it took an innocent question,from my then-four-year-old daughter,to make me appreciate that. 
 Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe,and we passed a man collecting for charity.,I didn't have any change to give him,,and she was disappointed.,Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book,and starts scribbling.,After a little while, I ask her what she's doing,,and she shows me a drawing,of a £5 note,to give to the man outside.,It's so sweet,,and more generous than Dad would have been.,But of course I explained to her,,"You can't do that; it's not allowed.",To which I get the classic four-year-old response:,"Why not?",Now I'm excited, because I actually think,I can answer this time.,So I launch into an explanation of how,an unlimited supply of money,chasing a limited number of goods,sends prices to the moon. 
 Something about that exchange stuck with me,,not because of the look of relief,on Pia's face when I finally finished,,but because it related,to the sanctity of the money supply,,a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned,by the reaction of central banks,to the financial crisis.,To reassure investors,,central banks began buying assets,to try and encourage investors to do the same.,They funded these purchases,with money they created themselves.,The money wasn't actually physically printed.,It's still sort of locked awaynin the banking system today.,But the amount created was unprecedented.,Together, the central banks of the U.S.,,U.K and Japan,increased the stock of money in their economies,by 3.7 trillion dollars.,That's three times, in factnthat's more than three times,,the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.,Three times! 
 Before the crisis,,this would have been utterly unthinkable,,yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.,The price of gold,,an asset thought to protect against inflation,,did jump,,but investors bought other assets,that offered little protection from inflation.,They bought fixed income securities, bonds.,They bought equities too.,For all the scare stories,,the actual actions of investors,spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence. 
 That confidence was based on two pillars.,The first was that, after years,of keeping inflation under control,,central banks were trusted,to take the money-printing away,if inflation became a threat.,Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.,As you can see, in the United States,,inflation for most of this period,remained below average.,It was the same elsewhere. 
 So how does all this relate to aid?,Well, this is where Dorothy,and the Mango Tree charity,that supports her comes in.,I was at one of their fundraising events,earlier this year,,and I was inspired to give a one-off donation,when I remembered that my firm,offers to match the charitable contributions,its employees make.,So think of this:,Instead of just being able to help Dorothy,and four of her classmates,to go through secondary school for a few years,,I was able to double my contribution.,Brilliant. 
 So following that conversation with my daughter,,and seeing the absence of inflation,in the face of money-printing,,and knowing that international aid payments,were falling at just the wrong time,,this made me wonder:,Could we match,but just on a much grander scale?,Let's call this scheme "Print Aid.",And here's how it might work.,Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,,the central bank would be mandated,to match the government's overseas aid payments,up to a certain limit.,Governments have been aiming to get aid,to 0.7 percent for years,,so let's set the limit at half of that,,0.35 percent of their income.,So it would work like this: If in a given year,the government gave 0.2 percent of its income,to overseas aid,,the central bank would simply top it up,with a further 0.2 percent.,So far so good. 
 How risky is this?,Well, this involves the creation of money,to buy goods, not assets.,It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.,But there are two important mitigating factors here.,The first is that by definition,,this money printed would be spent overseas.,So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation,in the country doing the actual printing,unless it leads to a currencyndepreciation of that country.,That is unlikely for the second reason:,the scale of the money that would be printed,under this scheme.,So let's think of an example,where Print Aid was in place,in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.,To match the aid payments made,by those governments over the last four years,,Print Aid would have generated,200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.,What would that look like,in the context of the increase in the money stock,that had already happened in those countries,to save the financial system?,Are you read for this?,You might struggle to see that at the back,,because the gap is quite small.,So what we're saying here,is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble,to save our financial systems,,and you know what, it paid off.,There was no inflation.,Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk,to print an extra 200 billion for aid?,Would the risks really be that different?,To me, it's not that clear.,What is clear is the impact on aid.,Even though this is the printing,of just three central banks,,the global aid that's given,over this period is up by almost 40 percent.,Aid as a proportion of national income,all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.,Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.,Governments are still incentivized to give.,But you know what, that's the npoint of a matching scheme. 
 So I think what we've learned,is that the risks from this money creation scheme,are quite modest,,but the benefits,are potentially huge.,Imagine what we could donwith 40 percent more funding.,We might be able to feed the front row. 
 The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,,apart from the fact that I've run out of time,,is that the window of opportunity for this idea,is a short one.,Today, money creation by central banks,is an accepted policy tool.,That may not always be the case.,Today there are universally agreed aims,for international aid.,That may not always be the case.,Today might be the only time,that these two things coincide,,such that we can afford the aid,that we've always aspired to give. 
 So, can we print money for international aid?,I seriously believe the question should be,,why not? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So this is a picture of my dad and me,nat the beach in Far Rockaway,,or actually Rockaway Park.,I'm the one with the blond hair.,My dad's the guy with the cigarette.,It was the 60's.,A lot of people smoked back then.,In the summer of 2009,nmy dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.,Cancer is one of those thingsnthat actually touches everybody.,If you're a man in the US,,you've got about a one in two chance,of being diagnosed with cancernduring your lifetime.,If you're a woman, you've gotnabout a one in three chance,of being diagnosed with cancer.,Everybody knows somebodynwho's been diagnosed with cancer. 
 Now, my dad's doing better today,,and part of the reason for that is thatnhe was able to participate in the trial,of an experimental new drugnthat happened to be specially formulated,and very good for his particularnkind of cancer.,There are over 200 kinds of cancer.,And what I want to talk about today,is how we can helpnmore people like my dad,,because we have to change the waynwe think about raising money,to fund cancer research. 
 So a while after my dad was diagnosed,,I was having coffeenwith my friend Andrew Lo.,He's the head of the Laboratorynfor Financial Engineering at MIT,,where I also have a position,,and we were talking about cancer.,And Andrew had been doingnhis own bits of research,,and one of the thingsnthat he had been told,and that he'd learnednfrom studying the literature,was that there's actuallyna big bottleneck.,It's very difficult to develop new drugs,,and the reason it's difficultnto develop new drugs,is because in the early stagesnof drug development,,the drugs are very risky,nand they're very expensive.,So Andrew asked menif I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,,work on some of the math and the analytics,and see if we could figure outnsomething we could do. 
 Now I'm not a scientist.,You know, I don't knownhow to build a drug.,And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lonor Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --,none of those guys are scientists either.,We don't know the first thingnabout how to make a cancer drug.,But we know a little bitnabout risk mitigation,and a little bitnabout financial engineering,,and so we started thinking,nwhat could we do?,I'm going to tell you about some work,we've been doingnover the last couple years,that we think couldnfundamentally change the way,research for cancernand lots of other things gets done.,We want to let the researchndrive the funding,,not the other way around. 
 So in order to get started,,let me tell younhow you get a drug financed.,Imagine that you're in your lab --nyou're a scientist, you're not like me --,and you've developed a new compound,that you think might be therapeuticnfor somebody with cancer.,Well, what you do is, you test in animals,nyou test in test tubes,,but there's this notionnof going from the bench to the bedside,,and in order to get from the bench,nthe lab, to the bedside, to the patients,,you've got to get the drug tested.,And the way the drug gets tested,is through a series of,nbasically, experiments,,through these large,nthey're called trials,,that they do to determinenwhether the drug is safe,and whether it works and all these things.,So the FDA has a very specific protocol.,In the first phase of this testing,,which is called testing for toxicity,nit's called Phase I.,In the first phase,nyou give the drug to healthy people,and you see if it actuallynmakes them sick.,In other words, are the sideneffects just so severe,that no matter how much good it does,,it's not going to be worth it?,Does it cause heart attacks,nkill people, liver failure?,And it turns out,nthat's a pretty high hurdle.,About a third of all drugsndrop out at that point.,In the next phase, you testnto see if the drug's effective,,and you give it to people with cancer,and you see if it makes them better.,And that's also a higher hurdle.nPeople drop out.,And in the third phase,nyou test it on a very large sample,,and you're trying to determinenwhat the right dose is,,is it better than what's available today?nIf not, then why build it?,When you're done with all that,,what you have is a very smallnpercentage of drugs,that start the processnactually come out the other side.,So those blue bottles --nthose blue bottles save lives,,and they're also worth billions,nsometimes billions a year. 
 So now here's a question:,if I were to ask you, for example,,to make a one-time investment of, say,n200 million dollars,to buy one of those bottles,,so 200 million dollars up front, one time,nto buy one of those bottles,,I won't tell you which one it is,,and in 10 years, I'll tell you whethernyou have one of the blue ones.,Does that sound like a goodndeal for anybody?,No. No, right?,And of course, it's a very,nvery risky trial position,,and that's why it's very hardnto get funding,,but to a first approximation,nthat's actually the proposal.,You have to fund these thingsnfrom the early stages on.,It takes a long time. 
 So Andrew said to me, he said,,"What if we stop thinkingnabout these as drugs?,What if we start thinkingnabout them as financial assets?",They've got really weird payoffnstructures and all that,,but let's throw everything we knownabout financial engineering at them.,Let's see if we can usenall the tricks of the trade,to figure out how to make these drugsnwork as financial assets. 
 Let's create a giant fund.,In finance, we know what to donwith assets that are risky.,You put them in a portfolionand you try to smooth out the returns.,So we did some math, and it turned outnyou could make this work,,but in order to make it work,nyou need about 80 to 150 drugs. 
 Now the good news is,nthere's plenty of drugs,that are waiting to be tested.,We've been told that there's a backlognof about 20 years of drugs,that are waiting to be testednbut can't be funded.,In fact, that early stagenof the funding process,,that Phase I and preclinical stuff,,that's actually, in the industry,ncalled the Valley of Death,because it's where drugs go to die.,It's very hard to for themnto get through there,,and of course, if you can'tnget through there,,you can't get to the later stages. 
 So we did this math,nand we figured out, OK,,well, you need about 80 to, say, 150,nor something like that, drugs.,And then we did a little morenmath, and we said, OK,,well, that's a fund of about threento 15 billion dollars.,So we kind of created a new problemnby solving the old one.,We got rid of the risk,nbut now we need a lot of capital,,and you can only get that kindnof capital in the capital markets.,Venture capitalistsnand philanthropies don't have it.,But we have to figure outnhow to get people in the capital markets,,who traditionally don't invest in this,nto want to invest in this stuff.,So again, financial engineeringnwas helpful here.,Imagine the megafund starts empty,,and what it does is it issuesnsome debt and some equity,,and that generates cash flow.,That cash flow is used, then, to buynthat big portfolio of drugs that you need,,and those drugs start working their waynthrough that approval process,,and each time they go throughna phase of approval,,they gain value.,Most of them don't make it,nbut a few of them do,,and with the ones that gainnvalue, you can sell some,,and when you sell them,,you have money to paynthe interest on those bonds,,but also to fund the next round of trials.,It's almost self-funding.,You do that for the coursenof the transaction,,and when you're done,nyou liquidate the portfolio,,pay back the bonds, and you can giventhe equity holders a nice return. 
 That was the theory,nand we talked about it,,we did a bunch of experiments,,and then we said,nlet's really try to test it.,We spent the next two yearsndoing research.,We talked to hundreds of expertsnin drug financing and venture capital.,We talked to peoplenwho have developed drugs.,We talked to pharmaceutical companies.,We actually looked at the data for drugs,,over 2,000 drugs that had been approvednor denied or withdrawn,,and we also ran millions of simulations.,And all that actually took a lot of time.,But when we were done, we found somethingnthat was sort of surprising.,It was feasible to structure that fund,such that when you were donenstructuring it,,you could actually produce low-risk bondsnthat would be attractive to bond holders,,that would give you yieldsnof about five to eight percent,,and you could produce equity,that would give equity holdersnabout a 12 percent return.,Now those returns aren't goingnto be attractive to a venture capitalist.,They want to make those big bets,and get those billion dollar payoffs.,But it turns out there are lots of othernfolks that would be interested.,That's right in the investment sweet spotnof pension funds and 401(k) plans,and all this other stuff. 
 So we published some articlesnin the academic press,,in medical journals, in finance journals.,But it wasn't until we actuallyngot the popular press interested in this,that we began to get some traction. 
 We wanted to do morenthan just make people aware of it.,We wanted people to get involved.,So we took all of our computer codenand made that available online,under an open-source licensento anybody that wanted it.,And you guys can download it today,if you want to run your own experimentsnto see if this would work.,And that was really effective,,because people that didn'tnbelieve our assumptions,could try their ownnand see how it would work. 
 Now there's an obvious problem, which is,,is there enough moneynin the world to fund this?,I've told you there's enough drugs,nbut is there enough money?,There's 100 trillion dollars of capital,currently investednin fixed-income securities.,That's a hundred thousand billion.,There's plenty of money. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we realized it's more thannjust money that's required.,We had to get people motivated, involved,,and get them to understand this.,And we started thinking about allnthe different things that could go wrong.,What are all the challengesnthat might get in the way?,And we had a long list.,We assigned a bunch of people,nincluding ourselves,,different pieces of this problem.,And we said, could you startna work stream on credit risk?,Could you start a work streamnon the regulatory aspects?,Could you start a work streamnon how you would manage so many projects?,And we had all these experts get togethernand do these different work streams,,and then we held a conference.,The conference was heldnover this past summer.,It was an invitation-only conference.,It was sponsorednby the American Cancer Society,and done in collaborationnwith the National Cancer Institute.,We had experts from every fieldnwe thought would be important,,including the government, and peoplenthat run research centers,,and for two days they heard the reports,from those five work streams,nand talked about it.,It was the first time the peoplenwho could make this happen,sat across the table from each othernand had these conversations. 
 Now these conferences,nit's typical to have a dinner,,and at that dinner,nyou get to know each other,,sort of like what we're doing here.,I happened to look out the window,,and hand on my heart,,on the night of this conference --nit was the summertime --,and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.,So I'd like to think it was a good sign. 
 Since the conference, we've got peoplenworking between Paris and San Francisco,,lots of different folks working on this,to try to see if we cannreally make it happen.,We're not looking to start a fund,nbut we want somebody else to do this.,Because, again, I'm not a scientist.,I can't build a drug.,I'm never going to have enough moneynto fund even one of those trials.,But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,,with our 529 plans,nwith our pension plans,,all of us together can actuallynfund hundreds of trials,and get paid well for doing it,and save millions of lives like my dad. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy,and its relationship with technology.,We tend to think of business strategy,as being a rather abstract body,of essentially economic thought,,perhaps rather timeless.,I'm going to argue that, in fact,,business strategy has always been premised,on assumptions about technology,,that those assumptions are changing,,and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,,and that therefore what that will drive us to,is a different concept of what we mean,by business strategy. 
 Let me start, if I may,,with a little bit of history.,The idea of strategy in business,owes its origins to two intellectual giants:,Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,,and Michael Porter, professornat the Harvard Business School.,Henderson's central idea was what you might call,the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass,against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.,What Henderson recognized was that,,in the business world,,there are many phenomena which are characterized,by what economists would call increasing returns --,scale, experience.,The more you do of something,,disproportionately the better you get.,And therefore he found a logic for investing,in such kinds of overwhelming mass,in order to achieve competitive advantage.,And that was the first introduction,of essentially a military concept of strategy,into the business world. 
 Porter agreed with that premise,,but he qualified it.,He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,,but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.,They have different components,,and each of those components might be driven,by a different kind of strategy.,A company or a businessnmight actually be advantaged,in some activities but disadvantaged in others.,He formed the concept of the value chain,,essentially the sequence of steps with which,a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,,becomes assembled into a finished product,,and then is distributed, for example,,and he argued that advantage accrued,to each of those components,,and that the advantage of the whole,was in some sense the sum or the average,of that of its parts.,And this idea of the value chain was predicated,on the recognition that,what holds a business together is transaction costs,,that in essence you need to coordinate,,organizations are more efficient at coordination,than markets, very often,,and therefore the nature and role and boundaries,of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.,It was on those two ideas,,Henderson's idea of increasing returns,to scale and experience,,and Porter's idea of the value chain,,encompassing heterogenous elements,,that the whole edifice of business strategy,was subsequently erected. 
 Now what I'm going to argue is,that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.,First of all, let's think about transaction costs.,There are really two componentsnto transaction costs.,One is about processing information,nand the other is about communication.,These are the economics ofnprocessing and communicating,as they have evolved over a long period of time.,As we all know from so many contexts,,they have been radically transformed,since the days when Porter and Henderson,first formulated their theories.,In particular, since the mid-'90s,,communications costs have actually been falling,even faster than transaction costs,,which is why communication, the Internet,,has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.,Now, those falling transaction costs,have profound consequences,,because if transaction costs are the glue,that hold value chains together, and they are falling,,there is less to economize on.,There is less need for verticallynintegrated organization,,and value chains at least can break up.,They needn't necessarily, but they can.,In particular, it then becomes possible for,a competitor in one business,to use their position in one step of the value chain,in order to penetrate or attack,or disintermediate the competitor in another. 
 That is not just an abstract proposition.,There are many very specific stories,of how that actually happened.,A poster child example wasnthe encyclopedia business.,The encyclopedia business,in the days of leatherbound books,was basically a distribution business.,Most of the cost was thencommission to the salesmen.,The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,,new technologies made the distribution of knowledge,many orders of magnitude cheaper,,and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.,It's now, of course, a very familiar story.,This, in fact, more generally was the story,of the first generation of the Internet economy.,It was about falling transaction costs,breaking up value chains,and therefore allowing disintermediation,,or what we call deconstruction. 
 One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,,well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia,when Britannica no longer has a business model?,And it was a while beforenthe answer became manifest.,Now, of course, we knownwhat it is: it's the Wikipedia.,Now what's special about thenWikipedia is not its distribution.,What's special about the Wikipedianis the way it's produced.,The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia,created by its users.,And this, in fact, defines what you might call,the second decade of the Internet economy,,the decade in which the Internet as a noun,became the Internet as a verb.,It became a set of conversations,,the era in which user-generatedncontent and social networks,became the dominant phenomenon.,Now what that really meant,in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework,was the collapse of certainnkinds of economies of scale.,It turned out that tens of thousands,of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia,could do just as good a job,,and certainly a much cheaper job,,than professionals in a hierarchical organization.,So basically what was happening was that one layer,of this value chain was becoming fragmented,,as individuals could take over,where organizations were no longer needed. 
 But there's another questionnthat obviously this graph poses,,which is, okay, we'vengone through two decades --,does anything distinguish the third?,And what I'm going to argue is that indeed,something does distinguish the third,,and it maps exactly on to the kind of,Porter-Henderson logic thatnwe've been talking about.,And that is, about data.,If we go back to around 2000,,a lot of people were talkingnabout the information revolution,,and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data,was growing, indeed growing quite fast.,but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.,We go forward to 2007,,not only had the world's stock of data exploded,,but there'd been this massive substitution,of digital for analog.,And more important even than that,,if you look more carefully at this graph,,what you will observe is that about a half,of that digital data,is information that has an I.P. address.,It's on a server or it's on a P.C.,But having an I.P. address means that it,can be connected to any other data,that has an I.P. address.,It means it becomes possible,to put together half of the world's knowledge,in order to see patterns,,an entirely new thing.,If we run the numbers forward to today,,it probably looks something like this.,We're not really sure.,If we run the numbers forward to 2020,,we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.,It's curious that the future is so muchnmore predictable than the present.,And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication,in the stock of information that is connected,via an I.P. address.,Now, if the number of connections that we can make,is proportional to the number of pairs of data points,,a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data,is a ten-thousandfold multiplication,in the number of patterns,that we can see in that data,,this just in the last 10 or 11 years.,This, I would submit, is a sea change,,a profound change in the economics,of the world that we live in. 
 The first human genome,,that of James Watson,,was mapped as the culmination of thenHuman Genome Project in the year 2000,,and it took about 200 million dollars,and about 10 years of work to map,just one person's genomic makeup.,Since then, the costs of mappingnthe genome have come down.,In fact, they've come down in recent years,very dramatically indeed,,to the point where the cost nis now below 1,000 dollars,,and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015,it will be below 100 dollars --,a five or six order of magnitude drop,in the cost of genomic mapping,in just a 15-year period,,an extraordinary phenomenon.,Now, in the days when mapping a genome,cost millions, or even tens of thousands,,it was basically a research enterprise.,Scientists would gather some representative people,,and they would see patterns, and they would try,and make generalizations aboutnhuman nature and disease,from the abstract patterns they find,from these particular selected individuals.,But when the genome can nbe mapped for 100 bucks,,99 dollars while you wait,,then what happens is, it becomes retail.,It becomes above all clinical.,You go the doctor with a cold,,and if he or she hasn't done it already,,the first thing they do is map your genome,,at which point what they're now doing,is not starting from some abstract nknowledge of genomic medicine,and trying to work out how it applies to you,,but they're starting from your particular genome.,Now think of the power of that.,Think of where that takes us,when we can combine genomic data,with clinical data,with data about drug interactions,with the kind of ambient data that devices,like our phone and medical sensors,will increasingly be collecting.,Think what happens when we collect all of that data,and we can put it together,in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.,This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,,but this will drive a revolution in medicine.,Fabulous, lots of people talk about this. 
 But there's one thing thatndoesn't get much attention.,How is that model of colossal sharing,across all of those kinds of databases,compatible with the business models,of institutions and organizations and corporations,that are involved in this business today?,If your business is based on proprietary data,,if your competitive advantagenis defined by your data,,how on Earth is that company or is that society,in fact going to achieve the value,that's implicit in the technology? They can't. 
 So essentially what's happening here,,and genomics is merely one example of this,,is that technology is driving,the natural scaling of the activity,beyond the institutional boundaries within which,we have been used to thinking about it,,and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries,in terms of which business strategy,as a discipline is formulated.,The basic story here is that what used to be,vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition,among essentially similar kinds of competitors,is evolving, by one means or another,,from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.,Why is that happening?,It's happening becausentransaction costs are plummeting,and because scale is polarizing.,The plummeting of transaction costs,weakens the glue that holds value chains together,,and allows them to separate.,The polarization of scale economies,towards the very small -- small is beautiful --,allows for scalable communities,to substitute for conventional corporate production.,The scaling in the opposite direction,,towards things like big data,,drive the structure of business,towards the creation of new kinds of institutions,that can achieve that scale.,But either way, the typically vertical structure,gets driven to becoming more horizontal. 
 The logic isn't just about big data.,If we were to look, for example,nat the telecommunications industry,,you can tell the same story about fiber optics.,If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,,or, for that matter, university research,,you can say exactly the same story,about so-called "big science.",And in the opposite direction,,if we look, say, at the energy sector,,where all the talk is about how households,will be efficient producers of green energy,and efficient conservers of energy,,that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.,That is the fragmentation of scale,because the very small can substitute,for the traditional corporate scale. 
 Either way, what we are driven to,is this horizontalization of the structure of industries,,and that implies fundamental changes,in how we think about strategy.,It means, for example, that we need to think,about strategy as the curation,of these kinds of horizontal structure,,where things like business definition,and even industry definition,are actually the outcomes of strategy,,not something that the strategy presupposes.,It means, for example, we need to work out,how to accommodate collaboration,and competition simultaneously.,Think about the genome.,We need to accommodate the very large,and the very small simultaneously.,And we need industry structures,that will accommodate very,nvery different motivations,,from the amateur motivationsnof people in communities,to maybe the social motivations,of infrastructure built by governments,,or, for that matter, cooperative institutions,built by companies that are otherwise competing,,because that is the only waynthat they can get to scale. 
 These kinds of transformations,render the traditional premises nof business strategy obsolete.,They drive us into a completely new world.,They require us, whether we are,in the public sector or the private sector,,to think very fundamentally differently,about the structure of business,,and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The first time I stoodnin the operating room,and watched a real surgery,,I had no idea what to expect.,I was a college student in engineering.,I thought it was going to be like on TV.,Ominous music playing in the background,,beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.,But it wasn't like that at all.,There was music playing on this day,,I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter),And there was plenty of conversation,,not just about the patient's heart rate,,but about sports and weekend plans.,And since then, the more surgeries I watched,,the more I realized this is how it is.,In some weird way, it's justnanother day at the office.,But every so often,the music gets turned down,,everyone stops talking,,and stares at exactly the same thing.,And that's when you knownthat something absolutely critical,and dangerous is happening. 
 The first time I saw that,I was watching a type of surgery,called laparoscopic surgery,And for those of you who are unfamiliar,,laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large,open incision you mightnbe used to with surgery,,a laparoscopic surgerynis where the surgeon creates,these three or more smallnincisions in the patient.,And then inserts these long, thin instruments,and a camera,,and actually does the procedure inside the patient.,This is great because there'snmuch less risk of infection,,much less pain, shorter recovery time.,But there is a trade-off,,because these incisions are created,with a long, pointed device,called a trocar.,And the way the surgeon uses this device,is that he takes it,and he presses it into the abdomen,until it punctures through.,And now the reason why neveryone in the operating room,was staring at that device on that day,was because he had to be absolutely careful,not to plunge it through,and puncture it into the organs nand blood vessels below.,But this problem should seem npretty familiar to all of you,because I'm pretty sure nyou've seen it somewhere else.,(Laughter),Remember this?,(Applause),You knew that at any second,that straw was going to plunge through,,and you didn't know if it was ngoing to go out the other side,and straight into your hand,,or if you were going tonget juice everywhere,,but you were terrified. Right?,Every single time you did this,,you experienced the samenfundamental physics,that I was watching in the operating room that day.,And it turns out it really is a problem.,In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said,that trocar incisions might nbe the most dangerous step,in minimally invasive surgery.,Again in 2009, we see a paper that says,that trocars account for over half,of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.,And, oh by the way,,this hasn't changed for 25 years. 
 So when I got to graduate school,,this is what I wanted to work on.,I was trying to explain to a friend of mine,what exactly I was spending my time doing,,and I said,,"It's like when you're drilling through a wall,to hang something in your apartment.,There's that moment when the drillnfirst punctures through the wall,and there's this plunge. Right?,And he looked at me and he said,,"You mean like when they drill ninto people's brains?",And I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter),And then I looked it up and theyndo drill into people's brains.,A lot of neurosurgical procedures,actually start with a drillnincision through the skull.,And if the surgeon isn't careful,,he can plunge directly into the brain.,So this is the moment when I started thinking,,okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,,why not other areas of medicine?,Because think about it, when wasnthe last time you went to the doctor,and you didn't get stuck with something? Right?,So the truth is,in medicine puncture is everywhere.,And here are just a couplenof the procedures that I've found,that involve some tissue puncture step.,And if we take just three of them —,laparoscopic surgery, nepidurals, and cranial drilling —,these procedures account nfor over 30,000 complications,every year in this country alone.,I call that a problem worth solving. 
 So let's take a look at some of the devices,that are used in these types of procedures.,I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.,It's used to puncture through nthe ligaments in the spine,and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.,Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.,These are actually usednto burrow into the bone,and collect bone marrownor sample bone lesions.,Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.,(Laughter),If I had told you it was a nmedical puncture device,you probably would have believed me.,Because what's the difference?,So, the more I did this research,the more I thought there has to be,a better way to do this.,And for me the key to this problem,is that all these different puncture devices,share a common set of fundamental physics. 
 So what are those physics?,Let's go back to drilling through a wall.,So you're applying a force non a drill towards the wall.,And Newton says the wallnis going to apply force back,,equal and opposite.,So, as you drill through the wall,,those forces balance.,But then there's that moment,when the drill first puncturesnthrough the other side of the wall,,and right at that moment nthe wall can't push back anymore.,But your brain hasn't reacted nto that change in force.,So for that millisecond,,or however long it takes you nto react, you're still pushing,,and that unbalanced force ncauses an acceleration,,and that is the plunge.,But what if right at the moment of puncture,you could pull that tip back,,actually oppose the forward acceleration?,That's what I set out to do. 
 So imagine you have a device,and it's got some kind of sharp tip nto cut through tissue.,What's the simplest way nyou could pull that tip back?,I chose a spring.,So when you extend that spring, nyou extend that tip out,so it's ready to puncture tissue,,the spring wants to pull the tip back.,How do you keep the tip in place,until the moment of puncture?,I used this mechanism.,When the tip of the devicenis pressed against tissue,,the mechanism expands outwards nand wedges in place against the wall.,And the friction that's generated,locks it in place and preventsnthe spring from retracting the tip.,But right at the moment of puncture,,the tissue can't push backnon the tip anymore.,So the mechanism unlocks nand the spring retracts the tip.,Let me show you that nhappening in slow motion.,This is about 2,000 frames a second,,and I'd like you to notice the tip,that's right there on the bottom, nabout to puncture through tissue.,And you'll see that nright at the moment of puncture,,right there, the mechanism unlocks nand retracts that tip back.,I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.,You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,,and right when it punctures nthat rubber membrane,it's going to disappearninto this white blunt sheath.,Right there.,That happens within four 100ths nof a second after puncture.,And because this device is designednto address the physics of puncture,and not the specifics of cranial drilling,or laparoscopic surgery, nor another procedure,,it's applicable across thesendifferent medical disciplines,and across different length scales. 
 But it didn't always look like this.,This was my first prototype.,Yes, those are popsicle sticks,,and there's a rubber band at the top.,It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.,And it proved to me that my idea worked,and it justified the next couplenyears of work on this project.,I worked on this because,this problem really fascinated me.,It kept me up at night.,But I think it should fascinate you too,,because I said puncture is everywhere.,That means at some point nit's going to be your problem too.,That first day in the operating room,I never expected to find myself non the other end of a trocar.,But last year, I got appendicitis nwhen I was visiting Greece.,So I was in the hospital in Athens,,and the surgeon was telling me,he was going to perform na laparoscopic surgery.,He was going to remove my appendix nthrough these tiny incisions,,and he was talking about whatnI could expect for the recovery,,and what was going to happen.,He said, "Do you have any questions?"nAnd I said, "Just one, doc.,What kind of trocar do you use?" 
 So my favorite quote nabout laparoscopic surgery,comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:,"It is puncture itself that causes risk.",That's my favorite quote nbecause H.C. Jacobaeus,was the first person to ever perform nlaparoscopic surgery on humans,,and he wrote that in 1912.,This is a problem that's been injuring andneven killing people for over 100 years. 
 So it's easy to think that fornevery major problem out there,there's some team of experts nworking around the clock to solve it.,The truth is that's not always the case.,We have to be better at finding those problems,and finding ways to solve them.,So if you come across a problem that grabs you,,let it keep you up at night.,Allow yourself to be fascinated,,because there are so many lives to save. 
 (Applause)So how many of you have evernbeen in a cave before?,Okay, a few of you.,When you think of a cave, most of you think,of a tunnel going through solid rock,,and in fact, that's how most caves are.,Around this half of the country,,most of your caves are made of limestone.,Back where I'm from, most of our ncaves are made of lava rock,,because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.,But the caves I want to share nwith you today are made,completely of ice, specifically glacier ice,that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain,in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood. 
 Now Mount Hood's only none hour's drive from Portland,,the largest city in Oregon,,where over two million people live.,Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer,is to find a new cave,and be the first human to ever go into it.,The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer,is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.,Now these days, with so many people hiking around,,it's pretty hard to find a new cave,,so you can imagine how excited we were,to find three new caves,within sight of Oregon's largest city,and realize that they had never been explored,or mapped before.,It was kind of like being an astronaut,,because we were getting tonsee things and go places,that no one had ever seen or gone to before. 
 So what is a glacier?,Well, those of you who havenever seen or touched snow,,you know that it's really light,,because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystalsnclumped together, and it's mostly air.,If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,,it gets really small, hard and dense.,Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows,over 20 feet a year,,it crushes the air out of it,and gradually forms it into hard blue ice.,Now each year, more and more icenstacks up on top of it,,and eventually it gets so heavy,that it starts to slide down the mountain,under its own weight,,forming a slow-moving river of ice.,When ice packed like that starts to move,,we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.,The name of the glacier these caves are formed in,is the Sandy Glacier.,Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,,it melts in the summer sun,,and it forms little rivers of waternon the flow along the ice,,and they start to melt and borentheir way down through the glacier,,forming big networks of caves,,sometimes going all the way downnto the underlying bedrock.,Now the crazy thing about glacier caves,is that each year, new tunnels form.,Different waterfalls pop up or move around,from place to place inside the cave.,Warm water from the top of the ice,is boring its way down,,and warm air from below the mountain,actually rises up, gets into the cave,,and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.,But the weirdest thing about glacier caves,is that the entire cave is moving,,because it's formed inside a block of ice,the size of a small city,that's slowly sliding down the mountain. 
 Now this is Brent McGregor,,my cave exploration partner.,He and I have both been exploring caves a long time,and we've been climbing mountains a long time,,but neither one of us had ever reallynexplored a glacier cave before.,Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video,of a couple of hikers that stumbled acrossnthe entrance to one of these caves.,There were no GPS coordinates for it,,and all we knew was that it was somewhere,out on the Sandy Glacier.,So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,,and we found a big crack in the ice.,We had to build snow and ice anchors,so that we could tie off ropesnand rappel down into the hole.,This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.,At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel,going right up the mountain,underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.,We followed this cave back for about a half mile,until it came to an end,,and then with the help of our survey tools,we made a three-dimensional map of the cave,on our way back out. 
 So how do you map a cave?,Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps,because they have pits and holes ngoing to overlapping levels.,To make a cave map, you have to set up,survey stations every few feet inside the cave,,and you use a laser to measurenthe distance between those stations.,Then you use a compass and an inclinometer,to measure the direction the cave is headed,and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.,Now those of you taking trigonometry,,that particular type of math is very useful,for making maps like this,because it allows you to measurenheights and distances,without actually having to go there.,In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,,the more useful I found all that math,that I originally hated in school to be.,So when you're done surveying,,you take all this data andnyou punch it into a computer,and you find someone that can draw really well,,and you have them draft up a map,that looks something like this,,and it'll show you both anbird's-eye view of the passage,as well as a profile view of the passage,,kind of like an ant farm view.,We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave,because it was like a big dragonnsleeping under the snow.,Now later this summer, as morensnow melted off the glacier,,we found more caves, and we realizednthey were all connected. 
 Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,,Brent discovered this new cave not very far away.,The inside of it was coated with ice,,so we had to wear big spikesnon our feet called crampons,so we could walk around without slipping.,This cave was amazing.,The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green,because the sunlight from far above,was shining through the ice and lighting it all up.,And we couldn't understand why this cave,was so much colder than Snow Dragon,until we got to the end and we found out why.,There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin,going 130 feet straight upnto the surface of the glacier.,Cold air from the top of the mountain,was flowing down this holenand blasting through the cave,,freezing everything inside of it.,And we were so excited about finding this new pit,,we actually came back in January the following year,so we could be the first ones to explore it.,It was so cold outside,,we actually had to sleep inside the cave.,There's our camp on the left side nof this entrance room.,The next morning, we climbed out of the cave,and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,,where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit,for the very first time.,Brent named this cave Pure Imagination,,I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there,were beyond what we could have ever imagined. 
 So besides really cool ice,nwhat else is inside these caves?,Well not too much lives in them nbecause they're so cold,and the entrance is actually covered up with snow,for about eight months of the year.,But there are some really cool things in there.,There's weird bacteria living in the water,that actually eat and digest rocks,to make their own food,to live under this ice.,In fact, this past summer, scientists collected,samples of water and ice,specifically to see if things called extremophiles,,tiny lifeforms that are evolvednto live in completely hostile conditions,,might be living under the ice,,kind of like what they hope to findnon the polar icecaps of Mars someday.,Another really cool things is that,,as seeds and birds land onnthe surface of the glacier and die,,they get buried in the snow,and gradually become part of the glacier,,sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.,As these caves form and melt ntheir way up into the ice,,they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling,and fall onto the cave floor,nwhere we end up finding them.,For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.,It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,,and it's just now starting to sprout.,This mallard duck feather,was found over 1,800 feetnin the back of Snow Dragon Cave.,This duck died on the surfacenof the glacier long, long ago,,and its feathers have finally made itndown through over 100 feet of ice,before falling inside the cave.,And this beautiful quartz crystal,was also found in the back of Snow Dragon. 
 Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe,that all these discoveries were nessentially in our own backyard,,hidden away, just waiting to be found.,Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering,in this busy world we live in,kind of seems like something nyou can only do with space travel now,,but that's not true.,Every year, new caves get discovered,that no one has ever been in before.,So it's actually not too late for one of you,to become a discoverer yourself.,You just have to be willing to look,and go where people don't often go,and focus your eyes and your mind,to recognize the discovery when you see it,,because it might be in your own backyard. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Women represent,50 percent of middle management,and professional positions,,but the percentages of womennat the top of organizations,represent not even a third of that number.,So some people hear that statistic and they ask,,why do we have so few women leaders?,But I look at that statistic,and, if you, like me, believe,that leadership manifests at every level,,you would see that there's a tremendous,,awesome resource of leaders,who are leading in middle management,,which raises a different question:,Why are there so many women,mired in the middle,and what has to happen,to take them to the top? 
 So some of you might be some of those women,who are in middle management,and seeking to move up in your organization.,Well, Tonya is a great examplenof one of these women.,I met her two years ago.,She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,,and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,,"I've worked really hard to improve my confidence,and my assertiveness and develop a great brand,,I get terrific performance evals from my boss,,my 360s in the organization let me know,that my teams love working for me,,I've taken every management course that I can here,,I am working with a terrific mentor,,and yet I've been passed over,twice for advancement opportunities,,even when my manager knows,that I'm committed to moving up,and even interested in an international assignment.,I don't understand why,I'm being passed over." 
 So what Tonya doesn't realize,is that there's a missing 33 percent,of the career success equation for women,,and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is,that's required to close the gender gap at the top. 
 In order to move up in organizations,,you have to be known for your leadership skills,,and this would apply to any of you,,women or men.,It means that you have to be recognized,for using the greatness in you,to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes,by engaging the greatness in others.,Put in other language,,it means you have to use your skills,and talents and abilities,to help the organization achieve,its strategic financial goals,and do that by working effectively with others,inside of the organization and outside.,And although all three of these elements,of leadership are important,,when it comes to moving up in organizations,,they aren't equally important.,So pay attention to the green box,as I move forward. 
 In seeking and identifying,employees with high potential,,the potential to go to the top of organizations,,the skills and competencies,that relate to that green box,are rated twice as heavily,as those in the other two elements of leadership.,These skills and competencies,can be summarized as business,,strategic, and financial acumen.,In other words, this skill set has to do,with understanding where the organization is going,,what its strategy is,,what financial targets it has in place,,and understanding your role,in moving the organization forward.,This is that missing 33 percent,of the career success equation for women,,not because it's missing in our capabilities,or abilities,,but because it's missing in the advice,that we're given. 
 Here's what I mean by that.,Five years ago, I was asked to moderate,a panel of executives,,and the topic for the evening was,"What do you look for in nhigh-potential employees?",So think about the three elements of leadership,as I summarize for you what they told me. 
 They said, "We look for people,who are smart and hard working and committed,and trustworthy and resilient.",So which element of leadership does that relate to?,Personal greatness. 
 They said, "We look for employees,who are great with our customers,,who empower their teams,,who negotiate effectively,,who are able to manage conflict well,,and are overall great communicators.",Which element of leadership does that equate to?,Engaging the greatness in others. 
 And then they pretty much stopped.,So I asked,,"Well, what about people,who understand your business,,where it's going,,and their role in taking it there?,And what about people who are able,to scan the external environment,,identify risks and opportunities,,make strategy or make strategic recommendations?,And what about people who are able,to look at the financials of your business,,understand the story that the financials tell,,and either take appropriate action,or make appropriate recommendations?" 
 And to a man, they said,,"That's a given." 
 So I turned to the audience,of 150 women and I asked,,"How many of you have ever been told,that the door-opener for career advancement,is your business, strategic and financial acumen,,and that all the other important stuff,is what differentiates you in the talent pool?",Three women raised their hand,,and I've asked this question of women,all around the globe in the five years since,,and the percentage is never much different. 
 So this is obvious, right?,But how can it be?,Well, there are primarily three reasons,that there's this missing 33 percent,in the career success advice given to women?,When organizations direct women,toward resources,that focus on the conventional advice,that we've been hearing for over 40 years,,there's a notable absence of advice that relates,to business, strategic and financial acumen.,Much of the advice is emphasizing,personal actions that we need to take,,like become more assertive, become more confident,,develop your personal brand,,things that Tonya's been working on,,and advice about working with other people,,things like learn to self-promote,,get a mentor, enhance your network,,and virtually nothing said,about the importance of business, strategic,and financial acumen.,This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.,What it means is that this is advice,that's absolutely essential for breaking through,from career start to middle management,,but it's not the advice,that gets women to break through,from the middle, where we're 50 percent,,to senior and executive positions.,And this is why conventional advice to women,in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top,and won't close it. 
 Now, the second reason,relates to Tonya's comments,about having had excellent performance evals,,great feedback from her teams,,and having taken every management training program,she can lay her hands on.,So you would think that she's getting,messages from her organization,through the talent development systems,and performance management systems,that let her know how important it is,to develop business, strategic and financial acumen,,but here again, that green square is quite small.,On average,,talent and performance management systems,in the organizations that I've worked with,focus three to one,on the other two elements of leadership,compared to the importance of business,,strategic and financial acumen,,which is why typical talent and performance systems,haven't closed and won't close,the gender gap at the top. 
 Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,,and this is really important to talk about,,because if organizations,,talent and performance systems,aren't giving people in general,information about the importance of,business, strategic and financial acumen,,how are men getting to the top?,Well, there are primarily two ways.,One is because of the positions,they're guided into,,and the other is because of informal mentoring,and sponsorship. 
 So what's women's experience,as it relates to mentoring?,Well, this comment from an executive,that I worked with recently,illustrates that experience.,He was very proud of the fact that last year,,he had two protégés: a man and a woman.,And he said, "I helped the woman build confidence,,I helped the man learn the business,,and I didn't realize that I was treating them,any differently.",And he was sincere about that. 
 So what this illustrates is that,as managers, whether we're women or men,,we have mindsets about women and men,,about careers in leadership,,and these unexamined mindsets,won't close the gender gap at the top.,So how do we take this idea,of the missing 33 percent,and turn it into action?,Well, for women, the answer is obvious:,we have to begin to focus more,on developing and demonstrating,the skills we have,that show that we're people who understand,our businesses, where they're headed,,and our role in taking it there.,That's what enables that breakthrough,from middle management,to leadership at the top.,But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.,One young scientist that works in a biotech firm,used her insight about the missing 33 percent,to weave financial impact data,into a project update she did,and got tremendous positive feedback,from the managers in the room. 
 So we don't want to put 100 percent,of the responsibility on women's shoulders,,nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:,In order for companies to achieve,their strategic financial goals,,executives understand that they have to have,everyone pulling in the same direction.,In other words, the term we use in business is,,we have to have strategic alignment.,And executives know this very well,,and yet only 37 percent,,according to a recent Conference Board report,,believe that they have that,strategic alignment in place.,So for 63 percent of organizations,,achieving their strategic financial goals,is questionable.,And if you think about what I've just shared,,that you have situations where at least 50 percent,of your middle managers,haven't received clear messaging,that they have to become focused on the business,,where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,,it's not surprising that that percentage,of executives who are confident about alignment,is so low,,which is why there are other people,who have a role to play in this.,It's important for directors on boards,to expect from their executives,proportional pools of women when they sit down,once a year for their succession discussions.,Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,,it could be a red flag,that their organization isn't as aligned,as it could potentially be.,It's important for CEOs,to also expect these proportional pools,,and if they hear comments like,,"Well, she doesn't havenenough business experience,",ask the question,,"What are we going to do about that?",It's important for H.R. executives,to make sure that the missing 33 percent,is appropriately emphasized,,and it's important for women and men,who are in management positions,to examine the mindsets we hold,about women and men, about careers and success,,to make sure we are creating a level playing field,for everybody. 
 So let me close with the latest chapter,in Tonya's story.,Tonya emailed me two months ago,,and she said that she had beenninterviewed for a new position,,and during the interview, they probed,about her business acumen,and her strategic insights into the industry,,and she said that she was so happy to report,that now she has a new position,reporting directly to the nchief information officer,at her company.,So for some of you, the missing 33 percent,is an idea for you to put into action,,and I hope that for all of you,,you will see it as an idea worth spreading,in order to help organizations be more effective,,to help women create careers that soar,,and to help close the gender gap at the top. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.,I've always had stage fright,,and not just a little bit,,it's a big bit.,And it didn't even matter until I was 27.,That's when I started writing songs, and even then,I only played them for myself.,Just knowing my roommates were in the nsame house made me uncomfortable. 
 But after a couple of years, njust writing songs wasn't enough.,I had all these stories and ideas,nand I wanted to share them with people,,but physiologically, I couldn't do it.,I had this irrational fear.,But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,,the more I wanted to perform. 
 So on the week of my 30th birthday,,I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,,and put this fear behind me.,Well, when I got there, it was packed.,There were like 20 people there.,(Laughter),And they all looked angry.,But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,,and I felt pretty good. 
 Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,,when my whole body rebelled, and nthis wave of anxiety just washed over me.,Now, when you experience fear, nyour sympathetic nervous system kicks in.,So you have a rush of adrenaline, nyour heart rate increases,,your breathing gets faster.,Next your non-essential systems start nto shut down, like digestion. (Laughter),So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routednaway from your extremities,,so your fingers don't work anymore.,Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,nyour Spidey sense tingles,,basically your whole body is trigger-happy.n(Laughter),That condition is not conducive nto performing folk music.,(Laughter),I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.,Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference,between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers,on a Tuesday night open mic?,(Laughter),I have never been more terrified -- until now.,(Laughter and cheers) 
 So then it was my turn,,and somehow, I get myself onto nthe stage, I start my song,,I open my mouth to sing the first line,,and this completely horrible vibrato --,you know, when your voice wavers -- ncomes streaming out.,And this is not the good kind of vibrato, nlike an opera singer has,,this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.,I mean, it's a nightmare.,I'm embarrassed, the audience nis clearly uncomfortable,,they're focused on my discomfort.,It was so bad.,But that was my first real experience nas a solo singer-songwriter. 
 And something good did happen --nI had the tiniest little glimpse,of that audience connection that I was hoping for.,And I wanted more. But I knew nI had to get past this nervousness. 
 That night I promised myself: nI would go back every week,until I wasn't nervous anymore.,And I did. I went back every single week,,and sure enough, week after week,,it didn't get any better. The same nthing happened every week. (Laughter),I couldn't shake it. 
 And that's when I had an epiphany.,And I remember it really well, because I ndon't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter),All I had to do was write a song nthat exploits my nervousness.,That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,,and the more nervous I was,,the better the song would be. Easy.,So I started writing a song about having stage fright.,First, fessing up to the problem,,the physical manifestations, how I would feel,,how the listener might feel.,And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,,and I knew I would be singing about a nhalf-octave higher than normal,,because I was nervous.,By having a song that explained nwhat was happening to me,,while it was happening,,that gave the audience permission to think about it.,They didn't have to feel bad nfor me because I was nervous,,they could experience that with me,,and we were all one big happy, nervous, nuncomfortable family. (Laughter) 
 By thinking about my audience, nby embracing and exploiting my problem,,I was able to take something nthat was blocking my progress,,and turn it into something that nwas essential for my success.,And having the stage fright song let nme get past that biggest issue,right in the beginning of a performance.,And then I could move on, nand play the rest of my songs,with just a little bit more ease.,And eventually, over time, I didn't nhave to play the stage fright song at all.,Except for when I was really nnervous, like now. (Laughter) 
 Would it be okay if I played the nstage fright song for you?,(Applause) 
 Can I have a sip of water?,(Music),Thank you. 
 ♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫,♫ this stage fright is real. ♫,♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫,♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫,♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫,♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫,♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫,♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫,♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫,(Laughter),♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine nyou all without clothes. ♫,♫ But singing in front of all naked strangersnscares me more than anyone knows. ♫,♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫,♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫,♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫,♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫,♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫,♫ And you tell me, don't worry nso much, you'll be great. ♫,♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫,♫ and I know how I get. ♫,♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫,♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫,♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't nhelp me when I sing. ♫,♫ But we shouldn't talk about nthese things right now, ♫,♫ really, I'm up on stage, and nyou're in the crowd. Hi. ♫,♫ And I'm not making fun of nunnurtured, irrational fear, ♫,♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫,♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫,♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫,♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫,♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫,♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫,♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫,♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫,♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫,(Applause)Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.,They're exactly what they sound like.,They are these huge collections of galaxies,,bound together by their mutual gravity.,So most of the points that you see on the screen,are not individual stars,,but collections of stars, or galaxies. 
 Now, by showing you some of these images,,I hope that you will quickly see that,galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,,but more than that,,I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,,they are surprising,,and they're useful.,Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.,And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters,is to describe the experiments,that you can do with them. 
 And I think there are four major types,,and the first type that I want to describe,is probing the very big.,So, how big?,Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.,It is so massive that the light passing through it,is being bent, it's being distorted,by the extreme gravity of this cluster.,And, in fact, if you look very carefully,you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.,Now, to give you a number,,this particular galaxy cluster,has a mass of over one million billion suns.,It's just mind-boggling how nmassive these systems can get.,But more than their mass,,they have this additional feature.,They are essentially isolated systems,,so if we like, we can think of them,as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.,And many of the questions that we might have,about the universe at large scales,,such as, how does gravity work?,might be answered by studying these systems. 
 So that was very big.,The second things is very hot.,Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,,and I subtract away all of the starlight,,what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.,This is in false color.,It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.,And the question is, if it's not galaxies,,what is emitting this light?,The answer is hot gas,,million-degree gas --,in fact, it's plasma.,And the reason why it's so hot,goes back to the previous slide.,The extreme gravity of these systems,is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,,and great speeds means great temperatures.,So this is the main idea,,but science is a rough draft.,There are many basic properties about this plasma,that still confuse us,,still puzzle us,,and still push our understanding,of the physics of the very hot. 
 Third thing: probing the very small.,Now, to explain this, I need to tell you,a very disturbing fact.,Most of the universe's matter,is not made up of atoms.,You were lied to.,Most of it is made up of something nvery, very mysterious,,which we call dark matter.,Dark matter is something that ndoesn't like to interact very much,,except through gravity,,and of course we would like to learn more about it.,If you're a particle physicist,,you want to know what happens nwhen we smash things together.,And dark matter is no exception. 
 Well, how do we do this?,To answer that question,,I'm going to have to ask another one,,which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?,Here is an image.,Since galaxy clusters are representative,slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.,They are mostly made up of dark matter,,and that's what you see in this bluish purple.,The red represents the hot gas,,and, of course, you can see many galaxies.,What's happened is a particle accelerator,at a huge, huge scale.,And this is very important,,because what it means is that very, very small,effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,,might be compounded and compounded,into something that we could npossibly observe in nature.,So, it's very funny.,The reason why galaxy clusters,can teach us about dark matter,,the reason why galaxy clusters,can teach us about the physics of the very small,,is precisely because they are so very big. 
 Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.,Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.,Okay, if there's anything stranger,I think it has to be dark energy.,If I throw a ball into the air,,I expect it to go up.,What I don't expect is that it go up,at an ever-increasing rate.,Similarly, cosmologists understand why,the universe is expanding.,They don't understand why it's expanding,at an ever-increasing rate.,They give the cause of this,accelerated expansion a name,,and they call it dark energy.,And, again, we want to learn more about it. 
 So, one particular question that we have is,,how does dark energy affect the universe,at the largest scales?,Depending on how strong it is,,maybe structure forms faster or slower.,Well, the problem with the large-scale structure,of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.,Here is a computer simulation.,And we need a way to simplify it.,Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.,If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,,the most important thing to do,is not to model the little positions,of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.,The most important thing to do is,to track the two biggest parts.,Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe,at the largest scales,by tracking its biggest pieces,and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. 
 So, as I come to a close,,you might feel slightly cheated.,I mean, I began by talking about,how galaxy clusters are useful,,and I've given some reasons,,but what is their use really?,Well, to answer this,,I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford,when he was asked about cars.,He had this to say:,"If I had asked people what they wanted,,they would have said faster horses.",Today, we as a society are faced,with many, many difficult problems.,And the solutions to these nproblems are not obvious.,They are not faster horses.,They will require an enormous amount of,scientific ingenuity. 
 So, yes, we need to focus,,yes, we need to concentrate,,but we also need to remember that,innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --,these things come,when we broaden our field of vision,when we step back,when we zoom out.,And I can't think of a better way to do this than,by studying the universe around us. Thanks. 
 (Applause)I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,,and when I was 13, I convinced,one of the largest toy companies,,toymakers, in the world, Hasbro,,to change the way that they marketed,one of their most best-selling products. 
 So allow me to tell you about it.,So I have a brother, Gavin.,When this whole shebang happened, he was four.,He loved to cook.,He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge,and mixing them into these, needless to say,,uneatable concoctions,,or making invisible macaroni and cheese.,He wanted to be a chef really badly.,And so what better gift for a kidnwho wanted to be a chef,than an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?,I mean, we all had those when we were little.,And he wanted one so badly. 
 But then he started to realize something.,In the commercials, and on the nboxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,,Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.,And the way that they did this,was they would only feature girlsnon the boxes or in the commercials,,and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens,and it would be in bright pink and purple,,very gender-specific colors to females, right?,So it kind of was sending a message,that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.,And this discouraged my brother a lot.,He thought that he wasn'tnsupposed to want to be a chef,,because that was something that girls did.,Girls cooked; boys didn't,,or so was the message that Hasbro was sending. 
 And this got me thinking,,God, I wish there was a way that I could change this,,that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro,so I could ask them and tell them,what they were doing wrong,and ask them to change it.,And that got me thinking about a website,that I had learned about a few months prior,called Change.org.,Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform,where you can create a petition and share it,across all of these social media networks,,through Facebook, through Twitter,,through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,,through whatever you can think of.,And so I created a petition,along with the YouTube videonthat I added to the petition,basically asking Hasbro,to change the way that they marketed it,,in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,,and most of all creating them,in less gender-specific colors. 
 So this petition started to take off --,humongously fast, you have no idea.,I was getting interviewed bynall these national news outlets,and press outlets, and it was amazing.,In three weeks, maybe three and a half,,I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So, needless to say, it was crazy.,Eventually, Hasbro themselvesninvited me to their headquarters,so they could go and unveil,their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me,in black, silver and blue.,It was literally one of the best moments of my life.,It was like &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&quot;,That thing was amazing. 
 What I didn't realize at the time, however,,was that I had become an activist,,I could change something,,that even as a kid, or maybe neven especially as a kid,,my voice mattered, and your voice matters too.,I want to let you know it's not going to be easy,,and it wasn't easy for me,,because I faced a lot of obstacles.,People online, and sometimes even in real life,,were disrespectful to me and my family,,and talked about how the wholenthing was a waste of time,,and it really discouraged me.,And actually, I have some examples,nbecause what's better revenge,than displaying their idiocy?,So, let's see.,From user name Liquidsore29 --,interesting user names we have here—,&quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&quot;,Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.,How about from Whiteboy77AGS:,"People always need somethingnto (female dog) about.",From Jeffrey Gutierrez:,&quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&quot; 
 So it was comments like these,that really discouraged me fromnwanting to make change in the future,because I thought, people don't care,,people think it's a waste of time,,and people are going to be disrespectful nto me and my family.,It hurt me, and it made me think,,what's the point of making change in the future? 
 But then I started to realize something.,Haters gonna hate.,Come on, say it with me. One, two, three:,Haters gonna hate.,So let your haters hate,,you know what, and make your change,,because I know you can.,I look out into this crowd,,and I see 400 people,who came out because they wanted to knownhow they could make a change,,and I know that you can, and allnof you watching at home can too,because you have so much that you ncan do and that you believe in,,and you can trade it across all these social media,,through Facebook, through Twitter, through nYouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,,through whatever else you can think of.,And you can make that change.,You can take what you believe in,and turn it into a cause and change it.,And that spark that you've been nhearing about all day today,,you can use that spark that you have within you,and turn it into a fire. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Intelligence -- what is it?,If we take a look back at the history,of how intelligence has been viewed,,one seminal example has been,Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that,"the question of whether a machine can think,is about as interesting,as the question of whether a submarine,can swim.",Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,,intended it as a criticism,of the early pioneers of computer science,,like Alan Turing.,However, if you take a look back,and think about what have been,the most empowering innovations,that enabled us to build,artificial machines that swim,and artificial machines that [fly],,you find that it was only through understanding,the underlying physical mechanisms,of swimming and flight,that we were able to build these machines.,And so, several years ago,,I undertook a program to try to understand,the fundamental physical mechanisms,underlying intelligence. 
 Let's take a step back.,Let's first begin with a thought experiment.,Pretend that you're an alien race,that doesn't know anything about Earth biology,or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,,but you have amazing telescopes,and you're able to watch the Earth,,and you have amazingly long lives,,so you're able to watch the Earth,over millions, even billions of years.,And you observe a really strange effect.,You observe that, over the course of the millennia,,Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids,up until a point,,and that at some point,,corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,,asteroids that are on,a collision course with the Earth,that otherwise would have collided,mysteriously get deflected,or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.,Now of course, as earthlings,,we know the reason would be,that we're trying to save ourselves.,We're trying to prevent an impact.,But if you're an alien race,who doesn't know any of this,,doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,,you'd be forced to put together,a physical theory that explains how,,up until a certain point in time,,asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet,mysteriously stop doing that.,And so I claim that this is the same question,as understanding the physical nature of intelligence. 
 So in this program that Inundertook several years ago,,I looked at a variety of different threads,across science, across a variety of disciplines,,that were pointing, I think,,towards a single, underlying mechanism,for intelligence.,In cosmology, for example,,there have been a variety ofndifferent threads of evidence,that our universe appears to be finely tuned,for the development of intelligence,,and, in particular, for the development,of universal states,that maximize the diversity of possible futures.,In game play, for example, in Go --,everyone remembers in 1997,when IBM's Deep Blue beat nGarry Kasparov at chess --,fewer people are aware,that in the past 10 years or so,,the game of Go,,arguably a much more challenging game,because it has a much higher branching factor,,has also started to succumb,to computer game players,for the same reason:,the best techniques right nownfor computers playing Go,are techniques that try to maximize future options,during game play.,Finally, in robotic motion planning,,there have been a variety of recent techniques,that have tried to take advantage,of abilities of robots to maximize,future freedom of action,in order to accomplish complex tasks.,And so, taking all of these different threads,and putting them together,,I asked, starting several years ago,,is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence,that we can factor out,of all of these different threads?,Is there a single equation for intelligence? 
 And the answer, I believe, is yes.n["F = T ∇ Sτ"],What you're seeing is probably,the closest equivalent to an E = mc²,for intelligence that I've seen.,So what you're seeing here,is a statement of correspondence,that intelligence is a force, F,,that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.,It acts to maximize future freedom of action,,or keep options open,,with some strength T,,with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,,up to some future time horizon, tau.,In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.,Intelligence tries to maximizenfuture freedom of action,and keep options open.,And so, given this one equation,,it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?,How predictive is it?,Does it predict human-level intelligence?,Does it predict artificial intelligence?,So I'm going to show you now a video,that will, I think, demonstrate,some of the amazing applications,of just this single equation. 
 (Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology,has suggested that universes that produce,more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes,should tend to have more favorable conditions,for the existence of intelligentnbeings such as ourselves.,But what if that tentative cosmological connection,between entropy and intelligence,hints at a deeper relationship?,What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate,with the production of long-term entropy,,but actually emerges directly from it?,To find out, we developed a software engine,called Entropica, designed to maximize,the production of long-term entropy,of any system that it finds itself in.,Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass,multiple animal intelligencentests, play human games,,and even earn money trading stocks,,all without being instructed to do so.,Here are some examples of Entropica in action. 
 Just like a human standingnupright without falling over,,here we see Entropica,automatically balancing a pole using a cart.,This behavior is remarkable in part,because we never gave Entropica a goal.,It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.,This balancing ability will have appliactions,for humanoid robotics,and human assistive technologies.,Just as some animals can use objects,in their environments as tools,to reach into narrow spaces,,here we see that Entropica,,again on its own initiative,,was able to move a largendisk representing an animal,around so as to cause a small disk,,representing a tool, to reach into a confined space,holding a third disk,and release the third disknfrom its initially fixed position.,This tool use ability will have applications,for smart manufacturing and agriculture.,In addition, just as some other animals,are able to cooperate by pullingnopposite ends of a rope,at the same time to release food,,here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish,a model version of that task.,This cooperative ability has interesting implications,for economic planning and a variety of other fields. 
 Entropica is broadly applicable,to a variety of domains.,For example, here we see it successfully,playing a game of pong against itself,,illustrating its potential for gaming.,Here we see Entropica orchestrating,new connections on a social network,where friends are constantly falling out of touch,and successfully keepingnthe network well connected.,This same network orchestration ability,also has applications in health care,,energy, and intelligence.,Here we see Entropica directing the paths,of a fleet of ships,,successfully discovering andnutilizing the Panama Canal,to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic,to the Pacific.,By the same token, Entropica,is broadly applicable to problems,in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation. 
 Finally, here we see Entropica,spontaneously discovering and executing,a buy-low, sell-high strategy,on a simulated range traded stock,,successfully growing assets under management,exponentially.,This risk management ability,will have broad applications in finance,and insurance. 
 Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen,is that a variety of signature human intelligent,cognitive behaviors,such as tool use and walking upright,and social cooperation,all follow from a single equation,,which drives a system,to maximize its future freedom of action. 
 Now, there's a profound irony here.,Going back to the beginning,of the usage of the term robot,,the play "RUR,",there was always a concept,that if we developed machine intelligence,,there would be a cybernetic revolt.,The machines would rise up against us.,One major consequence of this work,is that maybe all of these decades,,we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt,in reverse.,It's not that machines first become intelligent,and then megalomaniacal,and try to take over the world.,It's quite the opposite,,that the urge to take control,of all possible futures,is a more fundamental principle,than that of intelligence,,that general intelligence may in fact emerge,directly from this sort of control-grabbing,,rather than vice versa. 
 Another important consequence is goal seeking.,I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals,follow from this sort of framework?,And the answer is, the ability to seek goals,will follow directly from this,in the following sense:,just like you would travel through a tunnel,,a bottleneck in your future path space,,in order to achieve many other,diverse objectives later on,,or just like you would invest,in a financial security,,reducing your short-term liquidity,in order to increase your wealth over the long term,,goal seeking emerges directly,from a long-term drive,to increase future freedom of action. 
 Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,,once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed,and you could pass only a single concept,on to our descendants,to help them rebuild civilization,,that concept should be,that all matter around us,is made out of tiny elements,that attract each other when they're far apart,but repel each other when they're close together.,My equivalent of that statement,to pass on to descendants,to help them build artificial intelligences,or to help them understand human intelligence,,is the following:,Intelligence should be viewed,as a physical process,that tries to maximize future freedom of action,and avoid constraints in its own future. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The world is changing,in some really profound ways,,and I worry that investors,aren't paying enough attention,to some of the biggest drivers of change,,especially when it comes to sustainability.,And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,,like environmental and social issues,and corporate governance.,I think it's reckless to ignore these things,,because doing so can jeopardize,future long-term returns.,And here's something that may surprise you:,the balance of power to really influence sustainability,rests with institutional investors,,the large investors like pension funds,,foundations and endowments.,I believe that sustainable investing,is less complicated than you think,,better-performing than you believe,,and more important than we can imagine. 
 Let me remind you what we already know.,We have a population that's both growing and aging;,we have seven billion souls today,heading to 10 billion,at the end of the century;,we consume natural resources,faster than they can be replenished;,and the emissions that are mainly responsible,for climate change just keep increasing.,Now clearly, these arenenvironmental and social issues,,but that's not all.,They're economic issues,,and that makes them relevant,to risk and return.,And they are really complex,and they can seem really far off,,that the temptation may be to do this:,bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.,Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.,(Laughter) 
 But it makes me wonder,if the investment rules of today,are fit for purpose tomorrow.,We know that investors,,when they look at a companynand decide whether to invest,,they look at financial data,,metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,,valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.,And these things are fundamental, of course,,but they're not enough.,Investors should also look at performance metrics,in what we call ESG:,environment, social and governance.,Environment includes energy consumption,,water availability, waste and pollution,,just making efficient uses of resources.,Social includes human capital,,things like employee engagement,and innovation capacity,,as well as supply chain management,and labor rights and human rights.,And governance relates to the oversight,of companies by their boards and investors.,See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.,But ESG is the measure of sustainability,,and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors,with financial factors into the investment process.,It means limiting future risk,by minimizing harm to people and planet,,and it means providing capital to users,who deploy it towards productive,and sustainable outcomes. 
 So if sustainability matters financially today,,and all signs indicate more tomorrow,,is the private sector paying attention?,Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.,They started to see sustainability,not just as important but crucial to business success.,About 80 percent of global CEOs,see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation,and leading to competitive advantage,in their industries.,But 93 percent see ESG as the future,,or as important to the future of their business.,So the views of CEOs are clear.,There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability. 
 So how are companies actually leveraging ESG,to drive hard business results?,One example is near and dear to our hearts.,In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications,to the cloud environment,,and we retired another 85.,We virtualized our operating system environments,,and we completed numerous automation projects.,Now these initiatives createna more mobile workplace,,and they reduce our real estate footprint,,and they yield savings of 23 million dollars,in operating costs annually,,and avoid the emissions,of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.,That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars,off the road.,So awesome, right?,Another example is Pentair.,Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,,and about a decade ago,,they sold their core power tools business,and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.,That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?,Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,,there's more growth in water than in power tools,,and this company has their sights set,on what they call "the new New World.",That's four billion middle class people,demanding food, energy and water. 
 Now, you may be asking yourself,,are these just isolated cases?,I mean, come on, really?,Do companies that take sustainability into account,really do well financially?,The answer that may surprise you is yes.,The data shows that stocksnwith better ESG performance,perform just as well as others.,In blue, we see the MSCI World.,It's an index of large companies,from developed markets across the world.,And in gold, we see a subset of companies,rated as having the best ESG performance.,Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.,So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.,In some cases, there may be outperformance,from ESG.,In blue, we see the performance,of the 500 largest global companies,,and in gold, we see a subset of companies,with best practice in climate change strategy,and risk management.,Now over almost eight years,,they've outperformed by about two thirds.,So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.,But it does illustrate that environmental leadership,is compatible with good returns. 
 So if the returns are the same or better,and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?,Are investors, particularly institutional investors,,engaged?,Well, some are,,and a few are really at the vanguard.,Hesta.,Hesta is a retirement fund for health,and community services employees in Australia,,with assets of 22 billion [dollars].,They believe that ESG has the potential,to impact risks and returns,,so incorporating it into the investment process,is core to their duty,to act in the best interest of fund members,,core to their duty.,You gotta love the Aussies, right?,CalPERS is another example.,CalPERS is the pension fund,for public employees in California,,and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],,they are the second largest in the U.S.,and the sixth largest in the world.,Now, they're moving toward 100 percent,sustainable investment,by systematically integrated ESG,across the entire fund.,Why? They believe it's critical,to superior long-term returns, full stop.,In their own words, "long-term value creation,requires the effective management,of three forms of capital:,financial, human, and physical.,This is why we are concerned with ESG." 
 Now, I do speak to a lot of investors,as part of my job,,and not all of them see it this way.,Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,,so we don't do that here,",or, "We don't want to use the portfolio,to make policy statements.",The one that just really gets under my skin is,,"If you want to do something about that,,just make money, give the profits to charities.",It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling. 
 I mean, let me clarify something right here.,Companies and investors are not,singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.,They don't have indefinite social obligations,,and prudent investing and finance theory,aren't subordinate to sustainability.,They're compatible.,So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.,But institutional investors,are the x-factor in sustainability.,Why do they hold the key?,The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.,(Laughter),A lot of it.,I mean, a really lot of it.,The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.,The global bond market, 78 trillion.,That's 133 trillion combined.,That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.,That's the world's largest economy.,That's some serious freaking firepower. 
 So we can reconsider,some of these pressing challenges,,like fresh water, clean air,,feeding 10 billion mouths,,if institutional investors,integrated ESG into investment.,What if they used that firepower,to allocate more of their capital,to companies working the hardest,at solving these challenges,or at least not exacerbating them?,What if we work and save and invest,,only to find that the world we retire into,is more stressed and less secure than it is now?,What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water? 
 Now a fair question might be,,what if all this sustainability risk stuff,is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,,something for virtuous consumers,or lifestyle choice?,Well, President John F. Kennedy said something,about this that is just spot on:,"There are risks and costs to a program of action,,but they are far less than the long-range risks,and costs of comfortable inaction.",I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,,but since this is based onnwidespread scientific consensus,,the odds that it's not completely wrong,are better than the odds,that our house will burn down,or we'll get in a car accident.,Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter),But my point is that we buy insurance,to protect ourselves financially,in case those things happen, right?,So by investing sustainably,we're doing two things.,We're creating insurance,,reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,,and at the same time, in the short term,,we're not sacrificing performance.,[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax nand we create a better world for nothing?"] 
 Good, you like it. I like it too.,(Laughter),I like it because it pokes fun,at both sides of the climate change issue.,I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.,But what I really like about it,is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,,which is, "Plan for the future,,because that's where you're going to spend,the rest of your life." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want you all to think,about the third wordnthat was ever said about you --,or, if you were delivering,,about the person you were delivering.,And you can all mouth itnif you want or say it out loud.,It was -- the first two were, "It's a ..." 
 Audience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, it shows you that --,I also deal with issuesnwhere there's not certainty,of whether it's a girl or a boy,,so the mixed answer was very appropriate. 
 Of course, now the answer often comesnnot at birth but at the ultrasound,,unless the prospective parentsnchoose to be surprised,,like we all were. 
 But I want you to think about what it isnthat leads to that statement,on the third word,,because the third word,is a description of your sex.,And by that I mean,,made by a description of your genitals.,Now, as a pediatric endocrinologist,,I used to be very, very involvednand still somewhat am, in cases,in which there are mismatchesnin the externals,or between the externalsnand the internals,,and we literally have to figure out,what is the description of your sex.,But there is nothingnthat is definable at the time of birth,that would define you.,And when I talk about definition,,I'm talking about your sexual orientation.,We don't say, "It's a ... gay boy!","A lesbian girl!",Those situations don'tnreally define themselves,more until the second decade of life.,Nor do they define your gender,,which, as differentnfrom your anatomic sex,,describes your self-concept: 
 Do you see yourself as a male or female,,or somewhere in the spectrum in between?,That sometimes shows up,in the first decade of life,,but it can be very confusing for parents,,because it is quite normative for children,to act in a cross-gender play and way,,and, in fact, there are studies that show,that even 80 percent of childrennwho act in that fashion,will not persist in wantingnto be the opposite gender,at the time when puberty begins. 
 But, at the time that puberty begins --,that means between about age 10 to 12nin girls, 12 to 14 in boys --,with breast budding,,or two to three times'nincrease in the gonads,in the case of genetic males,,by that particular point,,the child who saysnthey are in the absolute wrong body,is almost certain to be transgender,and is extremely unlikelynto change those feelings,,no matter how anybody triesnreparative therapy,or any other noxious things. 
 Now, this is relatively rare,,so I had relatively littlenpersonal experience with this.,And my experience was more typical,,only because I had an adolescent practice.,And I saw someone age 24,,genetically female, went through Harvardnwith three male roommates,who knew the whole story,,a registrar who always listed his namenon course lists as a male name,,and came to me after graduating,,saying, "Help me. I know you knowna lot of endocrinology.",And indeed, I've treated a lot of peoplenwho were born without gonads.,This wasn't rocket science.,But I made a deal with him:,"I'll treat you if you teach me." 
 And so he did.,And what an education I got,from taking care of all the membersnof his support group.,And then I got really confused,,because I thought it wasnrelatively easy at that age,to just give people the hormones,of the gendernin which they were affirming.,But then my patient married,,and he married a womannwho had been born as a male,,had married as a male, had two children,,then went throughna transition into female.,And now this delightful female,was attached to my male patient --nin fact, got legally married,,because they showed up as a mannand a woman, and who knew, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was confused --,"Does this make so-and-so gay?,Does this make so-and-so straight?",I was getting sexual orientationnconfused with gender identity.,And my patient said to me,,"Look, look, look.,If you just think of the following,nyou'll get it right:,Sexual orientationnis who you go to bed with.,Gender identity is who you go to bed as." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I subsequently learnednfrom the many adults --,I took care of about 200 adults --,I learned from them,that if I didn't peek as to whontheir partner was in the waiting room,,I would never be able to guessnbetter than chance,,whether they were gay,nstraight, bi or asexual,in their affirmed gender.,In other words,,one thing has absolutely nothingnto do with the other.,And the data show it. 
 Now, as I took care of the 200 adults,,I found it extremely painful.,These people -- many of them --,had to give up so much of their lives.,Sometimes their parents would reject them,,siblings, their own children,,and then their divorcing spouse,would forbid themnfrom seeing their children.,It was so awful,,but why did they do it at 40 and 50?,Because they feltnthey had to affirm themselves,before they would kill themselves.,And indeed, the rate of suicidenamong untreated transgendered people,is among the highest in the world. 
 So, what to do?,I was intrigued, in goingnto a conference in Holland,,where they are experts in this,,and saw the most remarkable thing.,They were treating young adolescents,after giving them the most intensenpsychometric testing of gender,,and they were treating them by blockingnthe puberty that they didn't want.,Because basically,nkids look about the same,,each sex, until they go through puberty,,at which point, if you feelnyou're in the wrong sex,,you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.,The fantasy that you hadnthat your body will change,to be who you want it to be, with puberty,,actually is nullifiednby the puberty you get.,And they fall apart. 
 So that's why putting the pubertynon hold -- why on hold?,You can't just give themnthe opposite hormones that young.,They'll end up stunted in growth,,and you think you can havena meaningful conversation,about the fertility effectsnof such treatment,with a 10-year-old girl,na 12-year-old boy?,So this buys timenin the diagnostic process,for four or five years,,so that they can work it out.,They can have more and more testing,,they can live without feeling their bodiesnare running away from them.,And then, in a program they call 12-16-18,,around age 12 is when theyngive the blocking hormones,,and then at age 16, with retesting,,they re-qualify to receive --,now remember, the blockingnhormones are reversible,,but when you give the hormonesnof the opposite sex,,you now start spouting breastsnand facial hair and voice change,,depending on what you're using,,and those effects are permanent,,or require surgery to remove,,or electrolysis,,and you can never really affect the voice.,So this is serious,nand this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff. 
 And then at 18,nthey're eligible for surgery.,And while there's no good surgerynfor females to males genitally,,the male-to-female surgerynhas fooled gynecologists.,That's how good it can be.,So I looked at hownthe patients were doing,,and I looked at patientsnwho just looked like everybody else,,except they were pubertally delayed.,But once they gave them the hormones,consistent with the gender they affirm,,they look beautiful.,They look normal.,They had normal heights.,You would never be ablento pick them out in a crowd. 
 So at that point, I decidednI'm going to do this.,This is really where the pediatricnendocrine realm comes in,,because, in fact, if you're going to dealnwith it in kids aged 10 to 14,,that's pediatric endocrinology.,So I brought some kids in,,and this now became the standard of care,,and the [Boston]nChildren's Hospital was behind it.,By my showing themnthe kids before and after,,people who never got treatednand people who wished to be treated,,and pictures of the Dutch --,they came to me and said,,"You've got to donsomething for these kids.",Well, where were these kids before?,They were out there suffering,nis where they were. 
 So we started a program in 2007.,It became the first program of its kind --,but it's really of the Dutch kind --,in North America.,And since then, we have 160 patients.,Did they come from Afghanistan? No.,75 percent of them camenfrom within 150 miles of Boston. 
 And some came from England.,Jackie had been abusednin the Midlands, in England.,She's 12 years old there,,she was living as a girl,,but she was being beaten up.,It was a horror show,nthey had to homeschool her.,And the reason the British were coming,was because they would not treatnanybody with anything under age 16,,which means they were consigningnthem to an adult body,no matter what happened,,even if they tested them well.,Jackie, on top of it, was,nby virtue of skeletal markings,,destined to be six feet five.,And yet, she had just begunna male puberty. 
 Well, I did somethingna little bit innovative,,because I do know hormones,,and that estrogen is much more potent,in closing epiphyses, the growth plates,,and stopping growth, than testosterone is.,So we blocked her testosteronenwith a blocking hormone,,but we added estrogen,nnot at 16, but at 13.,And so here she is at 16, on the left.,And on her 16th birthday,nshe went to Thailand,,where they would dona genital plastic surgery.,They will do it at 18 now.,And she ended up 5'11".,But more than that,nshe has normal breast size,,because by blocking testosterone,,every one of our patientsnhas normal breast size,if they get to us at the appropriate age,,not too late. 
 And on the far right, there she is.,She went public -- semifinalistnin the Miss England competition.,The judges debatednas to, can they do this?,And one of them quipped, I'm told,,"But she has more natural selfnthan half the other contestants." 
 (Laughter) 
 And some of themnhave been rearranged a little bit,,but it's all her DNA.,And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.,And she was offered contracts as a model,,at which pointnshe teased me, when she said,,"You know, I might have hadna better chance as a model,if you'd made me six feet one." 
 (Laughter) 
 Go figure. 
 So this picture, I think, says it all.,It really says it all.,These are Nicole and brother Jonas,,identical twin boys,,and proven to be identical.,Nicole had affirmed herselfnas a girl as early as age three.,At age seven, they changed her name,,and came to me at the verynbeginnings of a male puberty.,Now you can imaginenlooking at Jonas at only 14,,that male puberty is early in this family,,because he looks more like a 16-year-old.,But it makes the point all the more,,of why you have to be consciousnof where the patient is.,Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here,,and Jonas is just going --nbiologic control.,This is what Nicole would look like,if we weren't doing what we were doing.,He's got a prominent Adam's apple.,He's got angular bonesnto the face, a mustache,,and you can see there'sna height difference,,because he's gone throughna growth spurt that she won't get.,Now Nicole is on estrogen.,She has a bit of a form to her. 
 This family wentnto the White House last spring,,because of their work in overturningnan anti-discrimination --,there was a bill that would block,the right of transgender people in Mainento use public bathrooms,,and it looked like the billnwas going to pass,,and that would have been a problem,,but Nicole went personallynto every legislator in Maine,and said, "I can do this.,If they see me, they'll understand,why I'm no threat in the ladies' room,,but I can be threatenednin the men's room.",And then they finally got it. 
 So where do we go from here?,Well, we still have a ways to gonin terms of anti-discrimination.,There are only 17 statesnthat have an anti-discrimination law,against discrimination in housing,,employment, public accommodation --,only 17 states, and five of themnare in New England.,We need less expensive drugs.,They cost a fortune.,And we need to getnthis condition out of the DSM.,It is as much a psychiatric diseasenas being gay and lesbian,,and that went out the window in 1973,,and the whole world changed. 
 And this isn't going to breaknanybody's budget.,This is not that common.,But the risks of notndoing anything for them,not only puts all of them at risknof losing their lives to suicide,,but it also says something aboutnwhether we are a truly inclusive society. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello, TEDWomen, what's up. 
 (Cheering) 
 Not good enough.,Hello, TEDWomen, what is up? 
 (Loud cheering) 
 My name is Maysoon Zayid,,and I am not drunk,,but the doctor who delivered me was.,He cut my mom six different times,in six different directions,,suffocating poor little me in the process.,As a result, I have cerebral palsy,,which means I shake all the time.,Look.,It's exhausting.,I'm like Shakira,nShakira meets Muhammad Ali. 
 (Laughter) 
 CP is not genetic.,It's not a birth defect.nYou can't catch it.,No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,,and I didn't get it becausenmy parents are first cousins,,which they are. 
 (Laughter) 
 It only happens from accidents,,like what happened to me on my birth day. 
 Now, I must warn you,,I'm not inspirational. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I don't want anyone in this roomnto feel bad for me,,because at some point in your life,,you have dreamt of being disabled.,Come on a journey with me.,It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,,you're driving around in circlesnlooking for parking,,and what do you see?,Sixteen empty handicapped spaces. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you're like, "God,ncan't I just be a little disabled?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Also, I've got to tell you,,I've got 99 problems,nand palsy is just one. 
 (Laughter) 
 If there was an Oppression Olympics,,I would win the gold medal.,I'm Palestinian, Muslim,,I'm female, I'm disabled,,and I live in New Jersey. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 If you don't feel betternabout yourself, maybe you should. 
 (Laughter) 
 Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.,I have always loved the fact,that my hood and my afflictionnshare the same initials.,I also love the fact,that if I wanted to walknfrom my house to New York City, I could. 
 A lot of people with CP don't walk,,but my parents didn't believe in "can't.",My father's mantra was,,"You can do it, yes you can can." 
 (Laughter),So, if my three older sistersnwere mopping,,I was mopping.,If my three older sistersnwent to public school,,my parents would sue the school system,and guarantee that I went too,,and if we didn't all get A's,,we all got my mother's slipper. 
 (Laughter) 
 My father taught me how to walknwhen I was five years old,by placing my heels on his feet,and just walking.,Another tactic that he used,is he would danglena dollar bill in front of me,and have me chase it. 
 (Laughter) 
 My inner stripper was very strong. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,No, by the first day of kindergarten,,I was walking like a champ,who had been punched one too many times. 
 (Laughter) 
 Growing up, there werenonly six Arabs in my town,,and they were all my family. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now there are 20 Arabs in town,,and they are still all my family. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't think anyoneneven noticed we weren't Italian. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This was before 9/11,and before politiciansnthought it was appropriate,to use "I hate Muslims"nas a campaign slogan.,The people that I grew up withnhad no problem with my faith.,They did, however, seem very concerned,that I would starvento death during Ramadan.,I would explain to themnthat I have enough fat,to live off of for three whole months,,so fasting from sunrisento sunset is a piece of cake. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have tap-danced on Broadway.,Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy. 
 (Applause) 
 My parents couldn'tnafford physical therapy,,so they sent me to dancing school.,I learned how to dance in heels,,which means I can walk in heels.,And I'm from Jersey,,and we are really concernednwith being chic,,so if my friends wore heels, so did I. 
 And when my friends wentnand spent their summer vacations,on the Jersey Shore, I did not.,I spent my summers in a war zone,,because my parents were afraid,that if we didn't go back to Palestinenevery single summer,,we'd grow up to be Madonna. 
 (Laughter) 
 Summer vacations often consistednof my father trying to heal me,,so I drank deer's milk,,I had hot cups on my back,,I was dunked in the Dead Sea,,and I remember the water burning my eyes,and thinking, "It's working!nIt's working!" 
 (Laughter) 
 But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.,I have to tell you, it's very boring,,but before I did yoga,,I was a stand-up comediannwho can't stand up.,And now I can stand on my head.,My parents reinforced this notion,that I could do anything,,that no dream was impossible,,and my dream was to be,on the daytime soap operan"General Hospital." 
 (Laughter) 
 I went to collegenduring affirmative action,and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,,Arizona State University,,because I fit every single quota. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like the pet lemurnof the theater department.,Everybody loved me.,I did all the less-than-intelligentnkids' homework,,I got A's in all of my classes,,A's in all of their classes. 
 (Laughter) 
 Every time I did a scenenfrom "The Glass Menagerie,",my professors would weep.,But I never got cast.,Finally, my senior year,,ASU decided to do a show calledn"They Dance Real Slow in Jackson.",It's a play about a girl with CP.,I was a girl with CP.,So I start shouting from the rooftops,,"I'm finally going to get a part!,I have cerebral palsy!,Free at last! Free at last!,Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!",I didn't get the part. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sherry Brown got the part.,I went racing to the headnof the theater department,crying hysterically,nlike someone shot my cat,,to ask her why,,and she said it was becausenthey didn't think I could do the stunts.,I said, "Excuse me,nif I can't do the stunts,,neither can the character." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This was a partnthat I was literally born to play,they gave it to a non-palsy actress.,College was imitating life.,Hollywood has a sordid history,of casting able-bodied actorsnto play disabled onscreen. 
 Upon graduating, I moved back home,,and my first acting gignwas as an extra on a daytime soap opera.,My dream was coming true.,And I knew that I would be promoted,from "Diner Diner"nto "Wacky Best Friend" in no time. 
 (Laughter) 
 But instead, I remainedna glorified piece of furniture,that you could only recognizenfrom the back of my head,,and it became clear to me,that casting directors,didn't hire fluffy,nethnic, disabled actors.,They only hired perfect people.,But there were exceptions to the rule.,I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,,Roseanne Barr, Ellen,,and all of these womennhad one thing in common:,they were comedians.,So I became a comic. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 My first gig was driving famous comics,from New York City to shows in New Jersey,,and I'll never forget the facenof the first comic I ever drove,when he realized that he was speedingndown the New Jersey Turnpike,with a chick with CP driving him. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've performed in clubs all over America,,and I've also performednin Arabic in the Middle East,,uncensored and uncovered. 
 (Laughter) 
 Some people say I'm the firstnstand-up comic in the Arab world.,I never like to claim first,,but I do know that they never heard,that nasty little rumornthat women aren't funny,,and they find us hysterical. 
 (Laughter) 
 In 2003, my brothernfrom another mother and father,Dean Obeidallah and I started,the New York Arab-AmericannComedy Festival,,now in its 10th year.,Our goal was to change the negative imagenof Arab-Americans in media,,while also reminding casting directors,that South Asian and Arabnare not synonymous. 
 (Laughter) 
 Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier,than conquering the challengenagainst the stigma against disability. 
 My big break came in 2010.,I was invited to be a guestnon the cable news show,"Countdown with Keith Olbermann.",I walked in lookingnlike I was going to the prom,,and they shuffle me into a studio,and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I looked at the stage manager,and I'm like, "Excuse me,ncan I have another chair?",And she looked at me and she went,,"Five, four, three, two ...",And we were live, right?,So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk,so that I wouldn't roll offnthe screen during the segment,,and when the interviewnwas over, I was livid.,I had finally gottennmy chance and I blew it,,and I knew I would never get invited back.,But not only did Mr. Olbermannninvite me back,,he made me a full-time contributor,,and he taped down my chair. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 One fun fact I learned while on the airnwith Keith Olbermann,was that humansnon the Internet are scumbags. 
 (Laughter),People say children are cruel,,but I was never made fun ofnas a child or an adult.,Suddenly, my disabilitynon the world wide web is fair game.,I would look at clips onlinenand see comments like,,"Yo, why's she tweakin'?","Yo, is she retarded?",And my favorite,n"Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.,What does she suffer from?,We should really pray for her.",One commenter even suggestednthat I add my disability to my credits:,screenwriter, comedian, palsy. 
 Disability is as visual as race.,If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,,then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.,The disabled are the largest —,Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on. 
 (Applause) 
 People with disabilitiesnare the largest minority in the world,,and we are the most underrepresentednin entertainment. 
 The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,,but I am here in front of you.,However, if I grew up with social media,,I don't think I would be.,I hope that together,,we can create more positive images,of disability in the medianand in everyday life.,Perhaps if there werenmore positive images,,it would foster less hate on the Internet.,Or maybe not.,Maybe it still takes a villagento teach our children well. 
 My crooked journey has taken mento some very spectacular places.,I got to walk the red carpet,flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci,and the iconic Loreen Arbus.,I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler,and work with my idol,nthe amazing Dave Matthews.,I toured the world as a headlinernon Arabs Gone Wild.,I was a delegate representingnthe great state of New Jersey,at the 2008 DNC.,And I founded Maysoon's Kids,,a charity that hopesnto give Palestinian refugee children,a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.,But the one momentnthat stands out the most,was when I got -- before this moment -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But the one momentnthat stands out the most,was when I got to perform,for the man who floats like a butterfly,and stings like a bee,,has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,,Muhammad Ali. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 It was the only timenthat my father ever saw me perform live,,and I dedicate this talk to his memory. 
 (Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba. 
 (English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,,and if I can can, you can can. 
 (Cheering) 
 (Applause)I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,,and so just before I get going,,I wanted to tell you as a South African,that one of the men who has inspired me most,passed away a few hours ago.,Nelson Mandela has come to the end,of his long walk to freedom.,And so this talk is going to be for him. 
 I grew up in wonder.,I grew up amongst those animals.,I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa,at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.,It's a place where my family has been,in the safari business for four generations.,Now for as long as I can remember,,my job has been to take people out into nature,,and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today,to have the opportunity,to bring some of my experiences out in nature,in to this gathering.,Africa is a place,where people still sit under starlit skies,and around campfires and tell stories,,and so what I have to share with you today,is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,,stories about heroes of heart.,Now my stories are not the stories,that you'll hear on the news,,and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,,I also know it to be a place,where people, animals and ecosystems,teach us about a more interconnected world. 
 When I was nine years old,,President Mandela came to stay with my family.,He had just been released fromnhis 27 years of incarceration,,and was in a period of readjustment,to his sudden global icon status.,Members of the African National Congress,thought that in the bush,he would have time to rest and recuperate,away from the public eye,,and it's true that lions tend to be,a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.,(Laughter),But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.,I would take him breakfast in bed,,and then, in an old track suit and slippers,,he would go for a walk around the garden.,At night, I would sit with my family,around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,,and watch images of that same,quiet man from the garden,surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people,as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.,He was bringing peace,to a divided and violent South Africa,,one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.,Mandela said often that the gift of prison,was the ability to go within and to think,,to create in himself,the things he most wanted for South Africa:,peace, reconciliation, harmony.,Through this act of immense open-heartedness,,he was to become the embodiment,of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu.",Ubuntu: I am because of you.,Or, people are not people,without other people.,It's not a new idea or value,but it's one that I certainly think at these times,is worth building on.,In fact, it is said that in thencollective consciousness of Africa,,we get to experience the deepest parts,of our own humanity,through our interactions with others.,Ubuntu is at play right now.,You are holding a space for me,to express the deepest truth of who I am.,Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,,and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,,and it's not the same as this.,(Laughter) 
 If Mandela was the nationalnand international embodiment,,then the man who taught me the most,about this value personally was this man,,Solly Mhlongo.,Solly was born under a tree,60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.,He would never have a lot of money,,but he was to be,one of the richest men I would ever meet.,Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.,Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it isnabout people who grow up looking after cattle,,but it makes for über-resourcefulness.,The first job that he ever got in the safari business,was fixing the safari trucks.,Where he had learned to do that out in the bush,I have no idea, but he could do it.,He then moved across into what we called,the habitat team.,These were the people on the reserve,who were responsible for its well-being.,He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,,he did some anti-poaching.,And then one day we were out together,,and he came across the tracks of wherena female leopard had walked.,And it was an old track,,but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,,and I tell you, I could tell by the speed,at which he moved on those pad marks,that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.,If you drove past Solly,somewhere out on the reserve,,you look up in your rearview mirror,,you'd see he'd stopped the car,20, 50 meters down the road,just in case you need help with something.,The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him,was when one of our clients said,,"Solly, you are pathologically helpful.",(Laughter) 
 When I started professionally guiding people,out into this environment,,Solly was my tracker.,We worked together as a team.,And the first guests we ever got,were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,,and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,,"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,,we want to see where you live.",So we took them up to his house,,and this visit of the philanthropist to his house,coincided with a time when Solly's wife,,who was learning English,,was going through a phasenwhere she would open the door,by saying, "Hello, I love you.,Welcome, I love you." (Laughter),And there was something so beautifully African,about it to me, this small house,with a huge heart in it. 
 Now on the day that Solly saved my life,,he was already my hero.,It was a hot day,,and we found ourselves down by the river.,Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,,and I rolled up my pants,,and I walked into the water.,Solly remained on the bank.,The water was clear running over sand,,and we turned and we begannto make our way upstream.,And a few meters ahead of us,,there was a place where a treenhad fallen out of the bank,,and its branches were touching the water,,and it was shadowy.,And if had been a horror movie,,people in the audience would have started saying,,"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter),And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.,Now the first thing that you noticenwhen a crocodile hits you,is the ferocity of the bite.,Wham! It hits me by my right leg.,It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.nI'm able to grab a branch.,It's shaking me violently.,It's a very strange sensation,having another creature try and eat you,,and there are few things thatnpromote vegetarianism like that.,(Laughter),Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.,He turns. He begins to make his way to me.,The croc again continues to shake me.,It goes to bite me a second time.,I notice a slick of blood in the water around me,that gets washed downstream.,As it bites the second time, I kick.,My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.,I pull myself up into the branches,,and as I come out of the water,nI look over my shoulder.,My leg from the knee down,is mangled beyond description.,The bone is cracked.,The meat is torn up.,I make an instant decision thatnI'll never look at that again.,As I come out of the water,,Solly arrives at a deep section,,a channel between us.,He knows, he sees the state of my leg,,he knows that between him and I,there is a crocodile,,and I can tell you this man doesn'tnslow down for one second.,He comes straight into the channel.,He wades in to above his waist.,He gets to me. He grabs me.,I'm still in a vulnerable position.,He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.,This is the other thing about Solly,nhe's freakishly strong.,He turns. He walks me up the bank.,He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.,He wraps it around my leg,,picks me up a second time,,walks me to a vehicle,,and he's able to get me to medical attention.,And I survive. 
 Now — (Applause) 
 Now I don't know how many people you know,that go into a deep channel of water,that they know has a crocodile in it,to come and help you,,but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.,And he is one amazing example,of what I have experienced all over Africa.,In a more collective society,,we realize from the inside,that our own well-being is deeply tied,to the well-being of others.,Danger is shared. Pain is shared.,Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.,Houses are shared. Food is shared.,Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts,and to share,,and what Solly taught me that day,is the essence of this value,,his animated, empathetic action,in every moment. 
 Now although the root word is about people,,I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.,And then I met this young lady.,Her name was Elvis.,In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis,because he said she walked like she was doing,the Elvis the pelvis dance.,She was born with very badlyndeformed back legs and pelvis.,She arrived at our reserve from a reserve,east of us on her migratory route.,When I first saw her,,I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.,And yet, for the next five years,she returned in the winter months.,And we would be so excited to be out in the bush,and to come across this unusual track.,It looked like an inverted bracket,,and we would drop whatevernwe were doing and we would follow,,and then we would come around the corner,,and there she would be with her herd.,And that outpouring of emotion,from people on our safari trucks,as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.,And it reminded me,that even people who grow up in cities,feel a natural connection,with the natural world and with animals.,And yet still I remained amazednthat she was surviving.,And then one day we came acrossnthem at this small water hole.,It was sort of a hollow in the ground.,And I watched as the matriarch drank,,and then she turned in that nbeautiful slow motion of elephants,,looks like the arm in motion,,and she began to make her way up the steep bank.,The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.,And I watched young Elvis,begin to psych herself up for the hill.,She got visibly -- ears came forward,,she had a full go of it and halfway up,,her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.,She attempted it a second time,,and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.,And on the third attempt,,an amazing thing happened.,Halfway up the bank,,a young teenage elephant came in behind her,,and he propped his trunk underneath her,,and he began to shovel her up the bank.,And it occurred to me,that the rest of the herd,was in fact looking after this young elephant.,The next day I watched again,as the matriarch broke a branch,and she would put it in her mouth,,and then she would break a second one,and drop it on the ground.,And a consensus developed between all of us,who were guiding people in that area,that that herd was in fact moving slower,to accommodate that elephant. 
 What Elvis and the herd taught me,caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,,and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,,we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves,reflected back at us.,And it is not only through other people,that we get to experience our humanity,but through all the creatures that live on this planet.,If Africa has a gift to share,,it's a gift of a more collective society.,And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,,what I see is the essence of that value,being invented here. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,,we know that you knew President Mandela,from early childhood,and that you heard the news as we all did today,,and deeply distraught,and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.,But I just wondered if you wanted,to share any additional thoughts,,because we know that you heard that news,just before coming in to do this session. 
 Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.,I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.,He was suffering.,And so of course there's the mixed emotions.,But I just think of so many occurrences,like the time he went on the Oprah show,and asked her what the show would be about.,(Laughter),And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you.",I mean, that's just incredible humility.,(Laughter) 
 He was the father of our nation,and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.,And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.,You know, he used to go tona rugby match and we would win.,Anywhere he went, things went well.,But I think that magic will be with us,,and the important thing is that we carry,what he stood for.,And so that's what I'm going to try and do,,and that's what people all over nSouth Africa are trying to do. 
 PM: And that's what you've done today.nBV: Oh, thank you. 
 PM: Thank you.nBV: Thank you. Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,,the Cuban shore,,looking out at that distant horizon,,believing, again,,that I'm going to make it all the way,across that vast,ndangerous wilderness of an ocean.,Not only have I tried four times,,but the greatest swimmers in the worldnhave been trying since 1950,,and it's still never been done. 
 The team is proud of our four attempts.,It's an expedition of some 30 people.,Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,,who somehow summons will,,that last drop of will within me,nwhen I think it's gone,,after many, many hours and days out there.,The shark expertsnare the best in the world --,large predators below.,The box jellyfish, the deadliest venomnin all of the ocean,,is in these waters,,and I have come close to dying from themnon a previous attempt.,The conditions themselves,,besides the sheer distancenof over 100 miles in the open ocean --,the currents and whirling eddiesnand the Gulf Stream itself,,the most unpredictablenof all of the planet Earth. 
 And by the way -- it's amusing to me,that journalists and people,nbefore these attempts, often ask me,,"Well, are you going to go with any boatsnor any people or anything?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?,That I'll just sort of donsome celestial navigation -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And carry a bowie knife in my mouth,,and I'll hunt fish and skin themnalive and eat them,,and maybe drag a desalinization plantnbehind me for fresh water. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, I have a team. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the team is expert,,and the team is courageous,,and brimming with innovationnand scientific discovery,,as is true of any majornexpedition on the planet. 
 And we've been on a journey.,And the debate has raged, hasn't it,,since the Greeks,,of isn't it what it's all about?,Isn't life about the journey,nnot really the destination?,And here we've been on this journey,,and the truth is, it's been thrilling.,We haven't reached that other shore,,and still, our sensenof pride and commitment,,unwavering commitment.,When I turned 60,nthe dream was still alive,from having tried this in my 20s --ndreamed it and imagined it.,The most famous body of waternon the Earth today, I imagine,,Cuba to Florida.,And it was deep. It was deep in my soul. 
 When I turned 60,,it wasn't so muchnabout the athletic accomplishment,,it wasn't the egonof "I want to be the first.",That's always there and it's undeniable.,But it was deeper.,It was "how much life is there left?",Let's face it -- we're allnon a one-way street, aren't we?,And what are we going to do?,What are we going to do as we go forward,nto have no regrets looking back?,And all this past year in training,,I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote,to paraphrase it,nfloating around in my brain.,It says, "You go ahead.,You go ahead and sit backnin your comfortable chair,and you be the critic,nyou be the observer,,while the brave onengets in the ring and engages,and gets bloody and gets dirty and failsnover and over and over again,,but yet isn't afraid and isn't timidnand lives life in a bold way." 
 And so of course I want to make it across.,It is the goal, and I shouldnbe so shallow to say that this year,,the destination was even sweeternthan the journey. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But the journey itselfnwas worthwhile taking.,And at this point, by this summer,,everybody -- scientists,nsports scientists,,endurance experts, neurologists,,my own team, Bonnie --,said it's impossible.,It just simply can't be done,nand Bonnie said to me,,"But if you're going to take the journey,,I'm going to see younthrough to the end of it,,so I'll be there." 
 And now we're there.,As we're looking out,nkind of a surreal moment,before the first stroke,,standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,,the Cuban flag is flying above,,all my team is out in their boats,nhands up in the air,,"We're here!,We're here for you!",Bonnie and I look at each other and say,,this year, the mantra is --nand I've been using it in training --,Find a way.,You have a dream,and you have obstaclesnin front of you, as we all do.,None of us ever get through this life,without heartache,,without turmoil,,and if you believe and you have faith,and you can get knocked downnand get back up again,and you believe in perseverance,as a great human quality,,you find your way.,And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,,and she said, "Let's findnour way to Florida." 
 And we started, and for the next 53 hours,,it was an intense,nunforgettable life experience.,The highs were high, the awe --,I'm not a religious person,nbut I'll tell you,,to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream,as if, as you're breathing,,you're looking down milesnand miles and miles,,to feel the majestynof this blue planet we live on --,it's awe-inspiring.,I have a playlist of about 85 songs,,and especially in the middlenof the night ...,That night, because we usenno lights -- lights attract jellyfish,,lights attract sharks,,lights attract baitfishnthat attract sharks,,so we go in the pitch black of the night.,You've never seen black this black.,You can't see the front of your hand,,and the people on the boat,nBonnie and my team on the boat --,they just hear the slapping of the arms,,and they know where I am,,because there's no visual at all.,And I'm out there kind of tripping outnon my little playlist. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've got tight rubber caps,nI don't hear a thing.,I've got goggles and I'm turningnmy head 50 times a minute,,and I'm singing ... 
 (Singing) Imagine there's no heaven 
 (Laughter) 
 doo doo doo doo doo,It's easy if you try,doo doo doo doo doo 
 And I can sing that songna thousand times in a row. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now there's a talent unto itself. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And each time I get done with, 
 (Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamernbut I'm not the only one 
 222. 
 (Singing) Imagine there's no heaven 
 (Laughter) 
 And when I get through the end,of a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,",I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...,exactly. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then there are the crises.,Of course there are.,And the vomiting starts,nthe seawater -- you're not well.,You're wearing a jellyfish masknfor the ultimate protection.,It's difficult to swim in.,It's causing abrasionsnon the inside of the mouth,,but the tentacles can't get you.,And the hypothermia sets in.,The water's 85 degrees,nand yet you're losing weight,and using calories.,And as you come overntoward the side of the boat --,not allowed to touch it,nnot allowed to get out,,but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition,and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.,I am seeing the Taj Mahal -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Over here.,I'm in a very different state -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm thinking, "Wow!,I never thought I'd be runningninto the Taj Mahal out here.,It's gorgeous!,I mean, how longndid it take them to build that?,It's just ...,So, uh -- wooo -- you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 We kind of have a cardinal rule,that I'm never told how far it is,nbecause we don't know how far it is.,What's going to happen to younbetween this point and that point?,What's going to happennto the weather and the currents,and, God forbid, you're stung,,when you don't think you couldnbe stung in all this armor.,Bonnie made a decisionncoming into that third morning,that I was suffering,,and I was hanging on by a thread.,And she said, "Come here,",and I came closento the boat, and she said,,"Look, look out there.",And I saw light,,because the day is easier than the night,,and I thought we were coming into day.,I saw a stream of white lightnalong the horizon,,and I said, "It's goingnto be morning soon.",And she said, "No, thosenare the lights of Key West.",It was 15 more hours,,which for most swimmersnwould be a long time. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You have no idea how manyn15-hour training swims I had done. 
 So here we go, and I somehow,nwithout a decision,,went into no counting of strokes,and no singing,and no quoting Stephen Hawkingnon the parameters of the universe.,I just went into thinkingnabout this dream, and why and how.,As I said, when I turned 60,,it wasn't about that concreten"Can you do it?",That's the everyday machinations.,That's the discipline,nand it's the preparation,,and there's a pride in that.,But I decided to think, as I went along,,about -- you know, the phrase usually is,n"reaching for the stars.",And in my case,nit's reaching for the horizon.,And when you reach for the horizon,,as I've proven, you may not get there.,But what a tremendous buildnof character and spirit,that you lay down;,what a foundation you lay downnin reaching for those horizons. 
 And now, the shore is coming.,And there's just a little partnof me that's sad.,The epic journey is going to be over. 
 So many people come up to me now and say,,"What's next?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "We love that!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "That little tracker on the computer?,When are you going to do the next one?,We can't wait to follow the next one.",Well, they were just there for 53 hours,,and I was there for years.,And so there won't be anothernepic journey in the ocean. 
 But the point is, and the point was,,that every day of our lives is epic.,And I'll tell you,nwhen I walked up onto that beach,,staggered up onto that beach ...,I had so many times,nin a very puffed-up ego way,,rehearsed what I would say ... 
 (Laughter) 
 on the beach.,When Bonnie thought the backnof my throat was swelling up,,she brought the medical teamnover to our boat,to say, "She's really beginningnto have trouble breathing;,another 12, 24 hoursnin the saltwater ..." --,the whole thing -- I just thought,nin my hallucinatory moment,,that I heard the word "tracheotomy." 
 (Laughter) 
 Bonnie said to the doctor,n"I'm not worried about her not breathing.,If she can't talknwhen she gets to the shore,,she's going to be pissed off." 
 (Laughter) 
 But the truth is, all those orationsnthat I had practiced,,just to get myself through somentraining swims as motivation --,it wasn't like that.,It was a very real moment,,with that crowd, with my team.,We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.,And we'll never forget it.nIt'll always be part of us. 
 The three things I did sort of blurt outnwhen we got there, was first:,Never, ever give up.,I live it.,What's the phrasenfrom today from Socrates? 
 Audience: To be is to do. 
 Diana Nyad: To be is to do.,So I don't stand up and say,n"Don't ever give up.",I didn't give up.,There was action behind these words. 
 The second is:,You can chase your dreamsnat any age; you're never too old.,Sixty-four; a thing no one,nat any age, any gender, could ever do,has done it.,And there's no doubt in my mind,that I am at the prime of my life today. 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 And the third thingnI said on that beach was,,it looks like the most solitarynendeavor in the world,,and in many ways, of course, it is.,And in other ways,nand the most important ways,,it's a team.,And if you think I'm a badass,nyou want to meet Bonnie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bonnie, where are you?,Where are you?,There's Bonnie Stoll. 
 (Applause) 
 My buddy. 
 (Applause) 
 The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,,"When you achieve your dreams,nit's not so much what you get,as who you have become in achieving them.",And yeah, I stand before you now.,In the three months since that swim ended,,I've sat down with Oprah,,and I've been innPresident Obama's Oval Office;,I've been invited to speaknin front of esteemed groups,such as yourselves;,I've signed a wonderfulnmajor book contract.,All of that's great,nand I don't denigrate it.,I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,,I'm walking around tall,because I am that bold, fearless person,nand I will be, every day,,until it's time for these days to be done. 
 Thank you very muchnand enjoy the conference. 
 Thank you. Thank you! 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.nThank you! Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Find a way! 
 (Applause)I want you to imagine,what a breakthrough this was,for women who were victims of violence,in the 1980s.,They would come into the emergency room,with what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,",and I would see a woman who was beaten,,I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist,and swollen eyes.,And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,,we would take her picture,,we would wait 90 seconds,,and we would give her the photograph.,And she would then have,the evidence she needed to go to court.,We were making what was invisible visible. 
 I've been doing this for 30 years.,I've been part of a social movement,that has been working on ending,violence against women and children.,And for all those years,,I've had an absolutely passionate,and sometimes not popular belief,that this violence is not inevitable,,that it is learned, and if it's learned,,it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.,(Applause) 
 Why do I believe this?,Because it's true.,It is absolutely true.,Between 1993 and 2010,,domestic violence among adult women,in the United States,has gone down by 64 percent,,and that is great news.,(Applause) 
 Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?,Our eyes were wide open.,Thirty years ago, women were beaten,,they were stalked, they were raped,,and no one talked about it.,There was no justice.,And as an activist, that was not good enough.,And so step one on this journey,is we organized,,and we created this extraordinary,underground network of amazing women,who opened shelters,,and if they didn't open a shelter,,they opened their home,so that women and children could be safe.,And you know what else we did?,We had bake sales, we had car washes,,and we did everything we could do to fundraise,,and then at one point we said,,you know, it's time that we went,to the federal government,and asked them to pay for these,extraordinary services that are saving people's lives.,Right? (Applause) 
 And so, step number two,,we knew we needed to change the laws.,And so we went to Washington,,and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.,And I remember walking through the halls,of the U.S. Capitol,,and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,,and I couldn't imagine,that anybody would ever challenge,this important piece of legislation.,I was probably 30 and naive.,But I heard about a congressman,who had a very, very different point of view.,Do you know what he called,this important piece of legislation?,He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.,The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.,Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984,in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.,(Laughter) 
 Ten years later, after lots of hard work,,we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,,which is a life-changing act,that has saved so many lives. (Applause),Thank you.,I was proud to be part of that work,,and it changed the laws,and it put millions of dollars into local communities. 
 And you know what else it did? It collected data.,And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.,In fact, I am a data nerd.,I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.,I am a data nerd,,and the reason for that is I want to make sure,that if we spend a dollar, that the program works,,and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan. 
 And I also want to say one other thing:,We are not going to solve this problem,by building more jails,or by even building more shelters.,It is about economic empowerment for women,,it is about healing kids who are hurt,,and it is about prevention with a capital P. 
 And so, step number three on this journey:,We know, if we're going tonkeep making this progress,,we're going to have to turn up the volume,,we're going to have to increase the visibility,,and we're going to have to engage the public.,And so knowing that, we wentnto the Advertising Council,,and we asked them to help us,build a public education campaign.,And we looked around the world to Canada,and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,,and we took this knowledge,and we built the first national,public education campaign,called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.,Take a look at one of our spots. 
 (Video) Man: Where's dinner? 
 Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so— 
 Man: What is this? Pizza.nWoman: If you had just called me,nI would have known— 
 Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza?nWoman: Honey, please don't be so loud.,Please don't—Let go of me! 
 Man: Get in the kitchen!nWoman: No! Help! 
 Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman) 
 That's what hurts! That's what hurts!n(Breaking glass) 
 Woman: Help me! 
 ["Children have to sit by and watch.nWhat's your excuse?"] 
 Esta Soler: As we were in the process,of releasing this campaign,,O.J. Simpson was arrested,for the murder of his wife and her friend.,We learned that he had a long history,of domestic violence.,The media became fixated.,The story of domestic violence,went from the back page,,but actually from the no-page, to the front page.,Our ads blanketed the airwaves,,and women, for the first time,,started to tell their stories.,Movements are about moments,,and we seized this moment.,And let me just put this in context.,Before 1980, do you have any idea,how many articles were in The New York Times,on domestic violence?,I'll tell you: 158.,And in the 2000s, over 7,000.,We were obviously making a difference. 
 But we were still missing a critical element.,So, step four: We needed to engage men.,We couldn't solve this problem,with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.,And I already told you I'm a data nerd.,National polling told us that men felt indicted,and not invited into this conversation.,So we wondered, how can we include men?,How can we get men to talk about,violence against women and girls?,And a male friend of mine pulled me aside,and he said, "You want men to talk about violence,against women and girls. Men don't talk.",(Laughter),I apologize to the men in the audience.,I know you do.,But he said, "Do you know what they do do?,They do talk to their kids.,They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches.",And that's what we did.,We met men where they were at,and we built a program.,And then we had this one event,that stays in my heart forever,where a basketball coach,was talking to a room filled with male athletes,and men from all walks of life.,And he was talking about the importance,of coaching boys into men,and changing the culture of the locker room,and giving men the tools tonhave healthy relationships.,And all of a sudden, he lookednat the back of the room,,and he saw his daughter,,and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,,and he said, "Michaela, come up here.",And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,,and she got up there,,and he said, "Sit down next to me.",She sat right down next to him.,He gave her this big hug, and he said,,"People ask me why I do this work.,I do this work because I'm her dad,,and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her.",And as a parent, I get it.,I get it,,knowing that there are so many sexual assaults,on college campuses,that are so widespread and so under-reported.,We've done a lot for adult women.,We've got to do a better job for our kids.,We just do. We have to. (Applause) 
 We've come a long way,since the days of the Polaroid.,Technology has been our friend.,The mobile phone is a global game changer,for the empowerment of women,,and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube,and all the social media helps us organize,and tell our story in a powerful way.,And so those of you in this audience,who have helped build those applications,and those platforms, as an organizer,,I say, thank you very much.,Really. I clap for you.,(Applause) 
 I'm the daughter of a man,who joined one club in his life,,the Optimist Club.,You can't make that one up.,And it is his spirit and his optimism,that is in my DNA.,I have been doing this work,for over 30 years,,and I am convinced, now more than ever,,in the capacity of human beings to change.,I believe we can bend the arc of human history,toward compassion and equality,,and I also fundamentally believe,and passionately believe,that this violence does not have to be part,of the human condition.,And I ask you, stand with us,as we create futures without violence,for women and girls and men and boys everywhere. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Nine years ago, I worked,for the U.S. government in Iraq,,helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.,And I was there, and I worked in that job,because I believe that technology,can improve people's lives.,One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper,at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,,and he said to me, "You Americans,,you can put a man on the moon,,but when I get home tonight,,I won't be able to turn on my lights.",At the time, the U.S. government had spent,more than two billion dollars,on electricity reconstruction.,How do you ensure technology reaches users?,How do you put it in their hands,so that it is useful? 
 So those are the questions that my colleagues and I,at D-Rev ask ourselves.,And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.,And I took over the organization four years ago,and really focused it on developing products,that actually reach users,,and not just any users,,but customers who live onnless than four dollars a day.,One of the key areas we've been working on recently,is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious,that medical devices have something in common,with Iraq's electricity grid then,,there are some commonalities.,Despite the advanced technology,,it's not reaching the people who need it most. 
 So I'm going to tell you about one ofnthe projects we've been working on,,the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee,for above-knee amputees.,And this project started whennthe Jaipur Foot Organization,,the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,,came to the Bay Area and they said,,"We need a better knee.",Chances are, if you're living onnless than four dollars a day,,and you're an amputee,,you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.,Most people think it's land mines,,but it's a vehicle accident.,You're walking by the side of the road,and you're hit by a truck,,or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,,you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.,And the reality is that ifnyou don't have much money,,like this young named Kamal right here,,the option you really have,is a bamboo staff to get around.,And how big a problem is this?,There's over three million amputees every year,who need a new or replacement knee. 
 And what are their options?,This is a high-end. This isnwhat we'd call a "smart knee.",It's got a microprocessor inside.,It can pretty much do anything,,but it's 20,000 dollars,,and to give you a sense of who wears this,,veterans, American veterans comingnback from Afghanistan or Iraq,would be fit with something like this.,This is a low-end titanium knee.,It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means,is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,,that mimics a natural human knee.,But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive,for people like Kamal.,And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.,This is a knee that's been designed specifically,for poor people.,And while you have affordability,,you've lost on functionality.,The mechanism here is a single axis,,and a single axis is like a door hinge.,So you can think about how unstable that would be.,And this is the type of mechanism 
 that the Jaipur Foot Organization was usingnwhen they were looking for a better knee,,and I just wanted to give you a sensenof what a leg system looks like,,because I'm showing you all these knees,and I imagine it's hard to think nhow it all fits together.,So at the top you have a socket,,and this fits over someone's residual limb,,and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.,And then you have the knee,,and here I've got a single axis on the knee,so you can see how it rotates,,and then a pylon, and then a foot.,And we've been able to develop a knee,,a polycentric knee, so that type of knee,that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,,for 80 dollars retail. 
 (Applause) 
 But the key is, you can have this great invention,,you can have this great design, but how do you get it,to the people who most need it?,How do you ensure it gets to themnand it improves their lives? 
 So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,,and we looked at three things that we really believe,gets technologies to customers, to users,,to people who need it. 
 And the first thing is that the product nneeds to be world class.,It needs to perform on par,or better than the best products on the market.,Regardless of your income level,,you want the most beautiful,,the best product that there is.,I'm going to show you a video now,of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.,He's wearing the same knee system here,with a single axis knee.,And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.,And you'll notice that he's struggling nwith stability as he's walking.,And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,,is that it's psychologically draining,to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.,Now this is a video of Kamal.,You remember Kamal earlier,nholding the bamboo staff.,He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,,and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.,And you can see his stability is much better. 
 So world class isn't just aboutntechnical performance.,It's also about human performance.,And most medical devices, we've learned,,as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,,for wealthier economies.,But the reality is our users, our customers,,they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.,We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.,And we designed our knee to haventhe greatest range of motion,of almost any other knee on the market. 
 So the second thing we learned, and this leads,into my second point, which is that we believe,that products need to bendesigned to be user-centric.,And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say,you need to be user-obsessed.,So it's not just the end usernthat you're thinking about,,but everyone who interacts with the product,,so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,,but also the context in which the knee is being fit.,What is the local market like?,How do all these components get to the clinic?,Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.,Everything that goes into ensuring,that this product gets to the end user,,and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used. 
 So I wanted to show you some of the iterations,we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,,so this is it right here.,(Clicking),Notice anything about it?,It clicks.,We'd seen that users had actually modified it.,So do you see that black strip right there?,That's a homemade noise dampener.,We also saw that our users had modified it,in other ways.,You can see there that that particular amputee,,he had wrapped bandages around the knee.,He'd made a cosmesis.,And if you look at the knee,,it's got those pointy edges, right?,So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt,or a sari, it's really obvious,that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,,and in societies where there's socialnstigma around being disabled,,people are particularly acute about this. 
 So I'm going to show you somenof the modifications we did.,We did a lot of iterations, not just naround this, but some other things.,But here we have the version three, nthe ReMotion Knee,,but if you look in here, you can see,the noise dampener. It's quieter.,The other thing we did is thatnwe smoothed the profile.,We made it thinner.,And something that's not obvious is that we,designed it for mass production. 
 And this goes into my last point.,We really, truly believe that if a product,is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,,it needs to be market-driven,,and market-driven means that products are sold.,They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.,Our product needs to be designed to offer value,to the end user.,It also has to be designed to be very affordable.,But a product that is valued by a customer,is used by a customer,,and use is what creates impact.,And we believe that as designers,,it holds us accountable to our customers.,And with centralized manufacturing,,you can control the quality control,,and you can hit that $80 price point,with profit margins built in.,And now, those profit margins are critical,,because if you want to scale, if you want to reach,all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,,it needs to be economically sustainable. 
 So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.,We have fit over 5,000 amputees,,and one of the big indicatorsnwe're looking at, of course,,is, does it improve lives?,Well, the standard is, is someone,still wearing their knee six months later?,The industry average is about 65 percent.,Ours is 79 percent,,and we're hoping to get that higher.,Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.,This is where we want to get, though,,in the next three years.,We'll double the impact in 2015,,and we'll double it each ofnthe following years after that.,But then we hit a new challenge,,and that's the number of skilled prosthetists,who are able to fit knees. 
 So I want to end with a story of Pournima.,Pournima was 18 years old,when she was in a car accidentnwhere she lost her leg,,and she traveled 12 hours by train,to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,,and while all of the amputees who wear our knees,affect us as the designers,,she's particularly meaningful to me nas an engineer and as a woman,,because she was in school,,she had just started school to study engineering.,And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,,I can go back and complete my studies.",And to me she represents the next generation,of engineers solving problems,and ensuring meaningful technologies,reach their users. 
 So thank you.

 Maya Penn: I've been drawing evernsince I could hold a crayon,,and I've been making animated flip books,since I was three years old.,At that age, I also learnednabout what an animator was.,There was a program on TV about jobs,most kids don't know about.,When I understood that an animator,makes the cartoons I saw on TV,,I immediately said, "That's what I want to be.",I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,,but that was a greatly defining moment in my life. 
 Animation and art has always been my first love.,It was my love for technology that sparked the idea,for "Malicious Dishes.",There was a virus on my computer,,and I was trying to get rid of it,,and all of a sudden, I just thought,,what if viruses have their ownnlittle world inside the computer?,Maybe a restaurant where they meet up,and do virusy things?,And thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born. 
 At four years old, my dad showed me,how to take apart a computernand put it back together again.,That started my love for technology.,I built my first website myself in HTML,,and I'm learning JavaScript and Python. 
 I'm also working on an animated series,called "The Pollinators.",It's about bees and othernpollinators in our environment,and why they're so important.,If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,,then all creatures, including ourselves,,that depend on these plants, would starve.,So I decided to take these cool creatures,and make a superhero team.,(Applause),(Foot stomp),(Music),(Roar),Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!,I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!,(Music) 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 All of my animations start with ideas,,but what are ideas?,Ideas can spark a movement.,Ideas are opportunities and innovation.,Ideas truly are what make the world go round.,If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be,where we are now with technology, medicine,,art, culture, and how we even live our lives.,At eight years old, I took my ideas,and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,,and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.,(Laughter),And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.,I'm 13 now, and although I started my business,in 2008,,my artistic journey started way before then.,I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to,incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.,I would find different fabrics around the house,,and say, &quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&quot;,and I had all these ideas for designs.,I noticed when I wore my creations,,people would stop me and say,,"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?",And I thought, I can start my own business. 
 Now I didn't have any business plans,at only eight years old.,I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations,that were safe for the environment,and I wanted to give back.,My mom taught me how to sew,,and on my back porch, I would sit and make,little headbands out of ribbon,,and I would write down the namesnand the price of each item.,I started making more items like hats,,scarves and bags.,Soon, my items began selling all over the world,,and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,,Canada and more. 
 Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,,like branding and marketing,,staying engaged with my customers,,and seeing what sold the most and the least.,Soon, my business really started to take off.,Then one day, Forbes magazine ncontacted me when I was 10 years old.,(Laughter),They wanted to feature me and my company,in their article. 
 Now a lot of people ask me,,why is your business eco-friendly?,I've had a passion for protecting the environment,and its creatures since I was little.,My parents taught me at an early age,about giving back and being angood steward to the environment.,I heard about how the dyes in some clothing,or the process of even making the items,was harmful to the people and the planet,,so I started doing my own research,,and I discovered that evennafter dyeing has being completed,,there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact,on the environment.,For example, the grinding of materials,,or the dumping of dried powder materials.,These actions can pollute the air,,making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.,So when I started my business,,I knew two things:,All of my items had to be eco-friendly,,and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made,went to local and global charities,and environmental organizations.,(Applause),I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs,that not only seeks to have a successful business,,but also a sustainable future.,I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers,without compromising thenability of future generations,to live in a greener tomorrow. 
 We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,,and that makes me even more passionate to save it.,But it's never enough to justnto get it through your heads,about the things that are happening in our world.,It takes to get it through your hearts,,because when you get it through your heart,,that is when movements are sparked.,That is when opportunities,and innovation are created,,and that is why ideas come to life. 
 Thank you, and peace and blessings. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about,the amazing parents who are behind,this incredible woman. Where are they?,Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!,(Applause)Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood,are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,,in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.,Her apartment was an oasis.,It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,,which was really warm milk nwith just a touch of caffeine.,She loved life.,And although she worked in a factory,,she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.,And I remember poring over those pictures with her,and then dancing with her to her favorite music. 
 And then, when I was eight and she was 60,,something changed.,She no longer worked or traveled.,She no longer danced.,There were no more coffee times.,My mother missed work and took her to doctors,who couldn't make a diagnosis.,And my father, who worked at night, nwould spend every afternoon with her,,just to make sure she ate. 
 Her care became all-consuming for our family.,And by the time a diagnosis was made,,she was in a deep spiral. 
 Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.,My grandmother had depression.,A deep, life-altering depression,,from which she never recovered.,And back then, so little nwas known about depression. 
 But even today, 50 years later,,there's still so much more to learn.,Today, we know that women nare 70 percent more likely,to experience depression over their lifetimes,compared with men.,And even with this high prevalence,,women are misdiagnosed between n30 and 50 percent of the time. 
 Now we know that women are more likely,to experience the symptoms nof fatigue, sleep disturbance,,pain and anxiety compared with men.,And these symptoms are often overlooked,as symptoms of depression. 
 And it isn't only depression in which nthese sex differences occur,,but they occur across so many diseases. 
 So it's my grandmother's struggles,that have really led me on a lifelong quest.,And today, I lead a center in which the mission,is to discover why these sex differences occur,and to use that knowledge,to improve the health of women. 
 Today, we know that every cell has a sex.,Now, that's a term coined nby the Institute of Medicine.,And what it means is that nmen and women are different,down to the cellular and molecular levels.,It means that we're different nacross all of our organs.,From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints. 
 Now, it was only 20 years ago,that we hardly had any data on women's health,beyond our reproductive functions.,But then in 1993,,the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.,And what this law did was it mandated,that women and minorities nbe included in clinical trials,that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.,And in many ways, the law has worked.,Women are now routinely nincluded in clinical studies,,and we've learned that there are major differences,in the ways that women and men,experience disease.,But remarkably,,what we have learned about these ndifferences is often overlooked. 
 So, we have to ask ourselves the question:,Why leave women's health to chance?,And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.,The first is that there is so much more to learn,and we're not making the investment,in fully understanding the extent nof these sex differences.,And the second is that we aren't ntaking what we have learned,,and routinely applying it in clinical care.,We are just not doing enough. 
 So, I'm going to share with you three examples,of where sex differences have nimpacted the health of women,,and where we need to do more. 
 Let's start with heart disease.,It's the number one killer of women nin the United States today.,This is the face of heart disease.,Linda is a middle-aged woman,,who had a stent placed in one of the arteries,going to her heart.,When she had recurring symptoms nshe went back to her doctor.,Her doctor did the gold standard test:,a cardiac catheterization.,It showed no blockages.,Linda's symptoms continued.,She had to stop working.,And that's when she found us.,When Linda came to us, we did nanother cardiac catheterization,and this time, we found clues.,But we needed another test,to make the diagnosis.,So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,,where you use soundwaves to look at the artery,from the inside out. 
 And what we found,was that Linda's disease didn't look like,the typical male disease.,The typical male disease looks like this.,There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.,Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,,looks like this.,The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely,along the artery, and it's harder to see.,So for Linda, and for so many women,,the gold standard test wasn't gold. 
 Now, Linda received the right treatment.,She went back to her life and, fortunately, today,she is doing well.,But Linda was lucky.,She found us, we found her disease. 
 But for too many women, that's not the case.,We have the tools.,We have the technology to make the diagnosis.,But it's all too often that these sex diffferences,are overlooked. 
 So what about treatment?,A landmark study that was published two years ago,asked the very important question:,What are the most effective treatments nfor heart disease in women?,The authors looked at papers nwritten over a 10-year period,,and hundreds had to be thrown out.,And what they found out was that nof those that were tossed out,,65 percent were excluded,because even though women nwere included in the studies,,the analysis didn't differentiate nbetween women and men.,What a lost opportunity.,The money had been spent,and we didn't learn how women fared.,And these studies could not contribute one iota,to the very, very important question,,what are the most effective treatments,for heart disease in women? 
 I want to introduce you to nHortense, my godmother,,Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague,,and somebody you may recognize --,Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.,All three women have something nvery important in common.,All three were diagnosed with lung cancer,,the number one cancer killer of women,in the United States today.,All three were nonsmokers.,Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.,Today, what we know is that women who arennonsmokers are three times more likely,to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men,who are nonsmokers.,Now interestingly, when women are ndiagnosed with lung cancer,,their survival tends to be better than that of men.,Now, here are some clues.,Our investigators have found that there are,certain genes in the lung tumor ncells of both women and men.,And these genes are activated,mainly by estrogen.,And when these genes are over-expressed,,it's associated with improved survival,only in young women.,Now this is a very early finding,and we don't yet know whether it has relevance,to clinical care.,But it's findings like this that may provide hope,and may provide an opportunity to save lives,of both women and men. 
 Now, let me share with you an example,of when we do consider sex differences,nit can drive the science.,Several years ago a new lung cancer drug,was being evaluated,,and when the authors looked nat whose tumors shrank,,they found that 82 percent were women.,This led them to ask the question: Well, why?,And what they found,was that the genetic mutations nthat the drug targeted,were far more common in women.,And what this has led to,is a more personalized approach,to the treatment of lung cancer nthat also includes sex. 
 This is what we can accomplish,when we don't leave women's health to chance.,We know that when you invest in research,,you get results.,Take a look at the death rate nfrom breast cancer over time.,And now take a look at the death rates,from lung cancer in women over time.,Now let's look at the dollars ninvested in breast cancer --,these are the dollars invested per death --,and the dollars invested in lung cancer.,Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer,has produced results.,They may not be fast enough,,but it has produced results.,We can do the same,for lung cancer and for every other disease. 
 So let's go back to depression.,Depression is the number one cause,of disability in women in the world today.,Our investigators have found,that there are differences in the brains,of women and men,in the areas that are connected with mood.,And when you put men and women,in a functional MRI scanner --,that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --,so you put them in the scanner nand you expose them to stress.,You can actually see the difference.,And it's findings like this,that we believe hold some of the clues,for why we see these very significant sex differences,in depression. 
 But even though we know,that these differences occur,,66 percent,of the brain research that begins in animals,is done in either male animals,or animals in whom the sex is not identified. 
 So, I think we have to ask again the question:,Why leave women's health to chance?,And this is a question that haunts those of us,in science and medicine,who believe that we are on the verge nof being able to dramatically improve,the health of women.,We know that every cell has a sex.,We know that these differences nare often overlooked.,And therefore we know that women nare not getting the full benefit,of modern science and medicine today.,We have the tools,but we lack the collective will and momentum. 
 Women's health is an equal rights issue,as important as equal pay.,And it's an issue of the quality,and the integrity of science and medicine.,(Applause),So imagine the momentum we could achieve,in advancing the health of women,if we considered whether these nsex differences were present,at the very beginning of designing research.,Or if we analyzed our data by sex. 
 So, people often ask me:,What can I do?,And here's what I suggest:,First, I suggest that you think about women's health,in the same way,that you think and care about other ncauses that are important to you.,And second, and equally as important,,that as a woman,,you have to ask your doctor,and the doctors who are caring nfor those who you love:,Is this disease or treatment different in women?,Now, this is a profound question nbecause the answer is likely yes,,but your doctor may not know nthe answer, at least not yet.,But if you ask the question, nyour doctor will very likely,go looking for the answer.,And this is so important,,not only for ourselves,,but for all of those whom we love.,Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,,a friend or a grandmother. 
 It was my grandmother's suffering,that inspired my work,to improve the health of women.,That's her legacy.,Our legacy can be to improve the health of women,for this generation,and for generations to come. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I'd like to talk today,about a powerful and fundamental aspect,of who we are: our voice.,Each one of us has a unique voiceprint,that reflects our age, our size,,even our lifestyle and personality.,In the words of the poet Longfellow,,"the human voice is the organ of the soul.",As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated,by how the voice is produced,,and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.,That's what I'd like to share with you. 
 I'm going to start by playing you a sample,of a voice that you may recognize. 
 (Recording) Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought,it was fairly obvious what I meant." 
 Rupal Patel: That was the voice,of Professor Stephen Hawking.,What you may not know is that same voice,may also be used by this little girl,who is unable to speak,because of a neurological condition.,In fact, all of these individuals,may be using the same voice,,and that's because there'snonly a few options available.,In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans,who are unable to speak,,and many of whom use computerized devices,to communicate.,Now that's millions of people worldwide,who are using generic voices,,including Professor Hawking,,who uses an American-accented voice.,This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice,really hit home,when I was at an assistive technology conference,a few years ago,,and I recall walking into an exhibit hall,and seeing a little girl and a grown man,having a conversation using their devices,,different devices, but the same voice.,And I looked around and I saw this happening,all around me, literally hundreds of individuals,using a handful of voices,,voices that didn't fit their bodies,or their personalities.,We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl,with the prosthetic limb of a grown man.,So why then the same prosthetic voice?,It really struck me,,and I wanted to do something about this. 
 I'm going to play you now a sample,of someone who has, two people actually,,who have severe speech disorders.,I want you to take a listen to how they sound.,They're saying the same utterance. 
 (First voice) 
 (Second voice),You probably didn't understand what they said,,but I hope that you heard,their unique vocal identities. 
 So what I wanted to do next is,,I wanted to find out how we could harness,these residual vocal abilities,and build a technology,that could be customized for them,,voices that could be customized for them.,So I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.,Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,,and what he'd been doing is building,personalized voices for people,by putting together,pre-recorded samples of their voice,and reconstructing a voice for them.,These are people who had lost their voice,later in life.,We didn't have the luxury,of pre-recorded samples of speech,for those born with speech disorder.,But I thought, there had to be a way,to reverse engineer a voice,from whatever little is left over. 
 So we decided to do exactly that.,We set out with a little bit of fundingnfrom the National Science Foundation,,to create custom-crafted voices that captured,their unique vocal identities.,We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,,for vocal identity. 
 Now before I get into the details of how,the voice is made and let you listen to it,,I need to give you a real quicknspeech science lesson. Okay?,So first, we know that the voice is changing,dramatically over the course of development.,Children sound different from teens,who sound different from adults.,We've all experienced this.,Fact number two is that speech,is a combination of the source,,which is the vibrations generated by your voice box,,which are then pushed through,the rest of the vocal tract.,These are the chambers of your head and neck,that vibrate,,and they actually filter that source sound,to produce consonants and vowels.,So the combination of source and filter,is how we produce speech.,And that happens in one individual. 
 Now I told you earlier that I'd spent,a good part of my career,understanding and studying,the source characteristics of people,with severe speech disorder,,and what I've found,is that even though their filters were impaired,,they were able to modulate their source:,the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.,These are called prosody, andnI've been documenting for years,that the prosodic abilities of these individuals,are preserved.,So when I realized that those same cues,are also important for speaker identity,,I had this idea.,Why don't we take the source,from the person we want the voice to sound like,,because it's preserved,,and borrow the filter,from someone about the same age and size,,because they can articulate speech,,and then mix them?,Because when we mix them,,we can get a voice that's as clear,as our surrogate talker --,that's the person we borrowed the filter from—,and is similar in identity to our target talker.,It's that simple.,That's the science behind what we're doing. 
 So once you have that in mind,,how do you go about building this voice?,Well, you have to find someone,who is willing to be a surrogate.,It's not such an ominous thing.,Being a surrogate donor,only requires you to say a few hundred,to a few thousand utterances.,The process goes something like this. 
 (Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs. 
 I love to sleep. 
 The sky is blue without clouds. 
 RP: Now she's going to go on like this,for about three to four hours,,and the idea is not for her to say everything,that the target is going to want to say,,but the idea is to cover all the different combinations,of the sounds that occur in the language.,The more speech you have,,the better sounding voice you're going to have.,Once you have those recordings,,what we need to do,is we have to parse these recordings,into little snippets of speech,,one- or two-sound combinations,,sometimes even whole words,that start populating a dataset or a database.,We're going to call this database a voice bank.,Now the power of the voice bank,is that from this voice bank,,we can now say any new utterance,,like, "I love chocolate" --,everyone needs to be able to say that—,fish through that database,and find all the segments necessary,to say that utterance. 
 (Video) Voice: I love chocolate. 
 RP: So that's speech synthesis.,It's called concatenative synthesis,nand that's what we're using.,That's not the novel part.,What's novel is how we make it sound,like this young woman. 
 This is Samantha.,I met her when she was nine,,and since then, my team and I,have been trying to build her a personalized voice.,We first had to find a surrogate donor,,and then we had to have Samantha,produce some utterances.,What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,,but that's enough for us to extract,her source characteristics.,What happens next is best described,by my daughter's analogy. She's six.,She calls it mixing colors to paint voices.,It's beautiful. It's exactly that.,Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample,of red food dye which we can infuse,into the recordings of her surrogate,to get a pink voice just like this. 
 (Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah. 
 RP: So now, Samantha can say this. 
 (Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.,I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. 
 RP: Thank you. (Applause) 
 I'll never forget the gentle smile,that spread across her face,when she heard that voice for the first time.,Now there's millions of people,around the world like Samantha, millions,,and we've only begun to scratch the surface.,What we've done so far is we have,a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.,who have donated their voices,,and we have been using those,to build our first few personalized voices.,But there's so much more work to be done.,For Samantha, her surrogate,came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger,who gave her the gift of voice.,And as a scientist, I'm so excited,to take this work out of the laboratory,and finally into the real world,so it can have real-world impact.,What I want to share with you next,is how I envision taking this work,to that next level.,I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors,from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,,coming together in this voice drive,to give people voices,that are as colorful as their personalities.,To do that as a first step,,we've put together this website, VocaliD.org,,as a way to bring together those,who want to join us as voice donors,,as expertise donors,,in whatever way to make this vision a reality. 
 They say that giving blood can save lives.,Well, giving your voice can change lives.,All we need is a few hours of speech,from our surrogate talker,,and as little as a vowel from our target talker,,to create a unique vocal identity. 
 So that's the science behind what we're doing.,I want to end by circling back to the human side,that is really the inspiration for this work.,About five years ago, we built our very first voice,for a little boy named William.,When his mom first heard this voice,,she said, "This is what William,would have sounded like,had he been able to speak.",And then I saw William typing a message,on his device.,I wondered, what was he thinking?,Imagine carrying around someone else's voice,for nine years,and finally finding your own voice.,Imagine that. 
 This is what William said:,"Never heard me before." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage. 
 Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out,and see so many women.,It's so not my regular experience, nas I know anyone else's. 
 PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,,which we assumed it would be, but nthat you had very much on your mind,the missing leadership positions, particularly nin the sector of technology and social media.,But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave? 
 SS: So I was really scared to get on nthis stage and talk about women,,because I grew up in the business nworld, as I think so many of us did.,You never talk about being a woman, because nsomeone might notice that you're a woman, right?,They might notice. Or worse, if you say "woman," npeople on the other end of the table,think you're asking for special ntreatment, or complaining.,Or worse, about to sue them. nAnd so I went through -- (Laughter),Right? I went through my entire business career,,and never spoke about being a woman, nnever spoke about it publicly.,But I also had noticed that it wasn't working. 
 I came out of college over n20 years ago, and I thought,that all of my peers were men and women, nall the people above me were all men,,but that would change,,because your generation had done such nan amazing job fighting for equality,,equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.,Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,,and now, often the only woman in a room.,And I talked to a bunch of people about,,should I give a speech at TEDWomen nabout women, and they said, oh no, no.,It will end your business career. You ncannot be a serious business executive,and speak about being a woman. nYou'll never be taken seriously again. 
 But fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech,,and I asked myself the question nMark Zuckerberg might --,the founder of Facebook and my boss --,asks all of us, which is, what nwould I do if I wasn't afraid?,And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't nafraid is I would get on the TED stage,,and talk about women, and leadership. nAnd I did, and survived. (Applause) 
 PM: I would say, not only survived. nI'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,,when you and I were standing backstage ntogether, and you turned to me,,and you told me a story.,And I said -- very last minute -- you know, nyou really should share that story. 
 SS: Oh, yeah.nPM: What was that story? 
 SS: Well, it's an important part of the njourney. So I had -- TEDWomen --,the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, nso I had gotten on a plane the day before,,and my daughter was three, she was nclinging to my leg: "Mommy, don't go.",And Pat's a friend, and so, not related nto the speech I was planning on giving,,which was chock full of facts and nfigures, and nothing personal,,I told Pat the story. I said, well, nI'm having a hard day.,Yesterday my daughter was clinging nto my leg, and "Don't go." 
 And you looked at me and said, nyou have to tell that story.,I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?,I'm going to get on a stage and admit nmy daughter was clinging to my leg?,And you said yes, because if you want to talk nabout getting more women into leadership roles,,you have to be honest about how hard it is.,And I did. And I think that's a really nimportant part of the journey. 
 The same thing happened when I wrote my book. nI started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,,I thought it was fabulous. It was nchock-full of data and figures,,I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai ntribes, and their sociological patterns.,My husband read it and he was like, this nis like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter),No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's nsomeone -- no one, no one will read this book.,And I realized through the process that I nhad to be more honest and more open,,and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still nnot feeling as self-confident as I should,,in many situations. My first and nfailed marriage. Crying at work.,Felling like I didn't belong there, nfeeling guilty to this day.,And part of my journey, starting on this stage, ngoing to "Lean In," going to the foundation,,is all about being more open and nhonest about those challenges,,so that other women can be more open and honest,,and all of us can work together towards real equality. 
 PM: I think that one of the most nstriking parts about the book,,and in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such na nerve and is resonating around the world,,is that you are personal in the book, nand that you do make it clear that,,while you've observed some things that are nvery important for other women to know,,that you've had the same challenges nthat many others of us have,,as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and npossibly the people who don't believe the same.,So talk about that process: deciding nyou'd go public with the private part,,and then you would also put yourself in nthe position of something of an expert,on how to resolve those challenges. 
 SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was --,you know, I never really expected to write na book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,,and it was viewed a lot, and it really nstarted impacting people's lives.,I got this great --- one of the first nletters I got was from a woman,who said that she was offered a really big npromotion at work, and she turned it down,,and she told her best friend she turned nit down, and her best friend said,,you really need to watch this TED Talk.,And so she watched this TED Talk, and she nwent back the next day, she took the job,,she went home, and she handed her nhusband the grocery list. (Laughter),And she said, I can do this. 
 And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't nonly women in the corporate world,,even though I did hear from a lot of nthem, and it did impact a lot of them,,it was also people of all different circumstances.,There was a doctor I met who was an nattending physician at Johns Hopkins,,and he said that until he saw my TED nTalk, it never really occurred to him,that even though half the students in nhis med school classes were women,,they weren't speaking as much as nthe men as he did his rounds.,So he started paying attention, and as he waited for nraised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.,So he started encouraging the nwomen to raise their hands more,,and it still didn't work.,So he told everyone, no more nhand raising, I'm cold-calling.,So he could call evenly on men and women. nAnd what he proved to himself was that,the women knew the answers just as well or better,,and he was able to go back nto them and tell them that.,And then there was the woman, stay-at-home nmom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,,with not a great school, she said that TED nTalk -- she's never had a corporate job,,but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school nand fight for a better teacher for her child.,And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.,And I realized that other women and nmen could find their voice through it,,which is why I went from the talk to the book. 
 PM: And in the book, you not only found your nvoice, which is clear and strong in the book,,but you also share what you've learned --,the experiences of other people in the lessons.,And that's what I'm thinking about nin terms of putting yourself in a --,you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.,So what did that feel like, and nbecome like in your life?,To launch not just a book, not just na best-selling, best-viewed talk,,but a movement, where people began to nliterally describe their actions at work as,,I'm leaning in. 
 SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, nI'm happy, and it's the very beginning.,So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is nan expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.,I have read every study, I have npored over the materials,,and the lessons are very clear. nBecause here's what we know:,What we know is that stereotypes are holding women nback from leadership roles all over the world.,It's so striking. "Lean In" is very global, nI've been all over the world,,talking about it, and -- cultures are so different.,Even within our own country, to Japan, nto Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,,they're so different. Except for one thing: gender.,All over the world, no matter what our cultures are,,we think men should be strong, nassertive, aggressive, have voice;,we think women should speak nwhen spoken to, help others. 
 Now we have, all over the world,,women are called "bossy." nThere is a word for "bossy,",for little girls, in every language there's one.,It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,,because if a little boy leads, nthere's no negative word for it,,it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy. 
 Now I know there aren't a lot of nmen here, but bear with me.,If you're a man, you'll have nto represent your gender.,Please raise your hand if you've been ntold you're too aggressive at work.,(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about nfive percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.,If you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've never been told you're too aggressive at work.,(Laughter) That is what audiences have nsaid in every country in the world,,and it's deeply supported by the data. 
 Now, do we think women are more naggressive than men? Of course not.,It's just that we judge them through a different lens,,and a lot of the character traits that you must nexhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,,are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,,and in a woman, she's bossy.,And the good news about this is that we ncan change this by acknowledging it. 
 One of the happiest moments nI had in this whole journey is,,after the book came out, I stood on a stage nwith John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.,He read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he ninvited me in front of his whole management team,,men and women, and he said, I thought we nwere good at this. I thought I was good at this.,And then I read this book, and I nrealized that we -- my company --,we have called all of our nsenior women too aggressive,,and I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.,And I want you to know we're nnever going to do it again. 
 PM: Can we send that to a lot of other npeople that we know? (Applause) 
 SS: And so John is doing that because nhe believes it's good for his company,,and so this kind of acknowledgement nof these biases can change it.,And so next time you all see nsomeone call a little girl "bossy,",you walk right up to that person, nbig smile, and you say,,"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has nexecutive leadership skills." (Laughter) 
 PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. nSS: Absolutely. 
 PM: And you did focus in the book -- and nthe reason, as you said, in writing it,,was to create a dialogue about this.,I mean, let's just put it out there, nface the fact that women are --,in a time when we have more open ndoors, and more opportunities --,are still not getting to the leadership positions.,So in the months that have come since the book,,in which "Lean In" focused on that and said,,here are some of the challenges that remain, and nmany of them we have to own within ourselves,and look at ourselves. What has changed?,Have you seen changes? 
 SS: Well, there's certainly more ndialogue, which is great.,But what really matters to me, nand I think all of us, is action.,So everywhere I go, CEOs, nthey're mostly men, say to me,,you're costing me so much money,because all the women want to nbe paid as much as the men.,And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter),At all. I mean, the women should nbe paid as much as the men. 
 Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.,Everywhere I go, women say they're getting nbetter relationships with their spouses,,asking for more help at home, asking for the npromotions they should be getting at work,,and importantly, believing it nthemselves. Even little things.,One of the governors of one of the states told me nthat he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,,literally sitting on the side nof the room, which they are,,and now he made a rule that all the women non his staff need to sit at the table. 
 The foundation I started along nwith the book "Lean In",helps women, or men, start circles -- small groups,,it can be 10, it can be however many nyou want, which meet once a month.,I would have hoped that by now, we'd have nabout 500 circles. That would've been great.,You know, 500 times roughly 10.,There are over 12,000 circles nin 50 countries in the world. 
 PM: Wow, that's amazing. 
 SS: And these are people who nare meeting every single month.,I met one of them, I was in Beijing.,A group of women, they're all about 29 or 30, nthey started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,,several of them grew up in very poor, rural China.,These women are 29, they are told by ntheir society that they are "left over,",because they are not yet married,,and the process of coming together nonce a month at a meeting,is helping them define who they are for themselves.,What they want in their careers. The nkind of partners they want, if at all.,I looked at them, we went around nand introduced ourselves,,and they all said their names nand where they're from,,and I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg, nand this was my dream.,And I kind of just started crying.,Right, which, I admit, I do. Right? nI've talked about it before.,But the fact that a woman so far away out in nthe world, who grew up in a rural village,,who's being told to marry someone nshe doesn't want to marry,,can now go meet once a month with na group of people and refuse that,,and find life on her own terms.,That's the kind of change we have to hope for. 
 PM: Have you been surprised by nthe global nature of the message?,Because I think when the book first ncame out, many people thought,,well, this is a really important handbook nfor young women on their way up.,They need to look at this, anticipate nthe barriers, and recognize them,,put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,,but that it's really for women who are that. nDoing that. Pursuing the corporate world.,And yet the book is being read, as you nsay, in rural and developing countries.,What part of that has surprised you, and nperhaps led to a new perspective on your part? 
 SS: The book is about self-confidence, nand about equality.,And it turns out, everywhere in the world, nwomen need more self-confidence,,because the world tells us we're not equal to men.,Everywhere in the world, we live in na world where the men get "and,",and women get "or.",I've never met a man who's been nasked how he does it all. (Laughter) 
 Again, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:,Please raise your hand if you've nbeen asked, how do you do it all?,(Laughter),Men only.,Women, women. Please raise your hand nif you've been asked how you do it all?,We assume men can do it all, nslash -- have jobs and children.,We assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,,because the great majority of women everywhere nin the world, including the United States,,work full time and have children. 
 And I think people don't fully understand nhow broad the message is.,There is a circle that's been started nfor rescued sex workers in Miami.,They're using "Lean In" to help npeople make the transition,back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing nthem from their pimps, and using it.,There are dress-for-success groups nin Texas which are using the book,,for women who have never been to college.,And we know there are groups nall the way to Ethiopia.,And so these messages of equality -- of how women nare told they can't have what men can have --,how we assume that leadership is for men, nhow we assume that voice is for men,,these affect all of us, and I nthink they are very universal.,And it's part of what TEDWomen does.,It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,,which is more women, more voice, more equality. 
 PM: If you were invited now to nmake another TEDWomen talk,,what would you say that is a result nof this experience, for you personally,,and what you've learned about women, and men,,as you've made this journey? 
 SS: I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly,,but I think I can say it more strongly --,I want to say that the status quo is not enough.,That it's not good enough, that it's nnot changing quickly enough.,Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book, nanother year of data came out from the U.S. Census.,And you know what we found?,No movement in the wage gap nfor women in the United States.,Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.,If you are a black woman, 64 cents.,If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.,Do you know when the last ntime those numbers went up?,2002.,We are stagnating, we are nstagnating in so many ways.,And I think we are not really being honest about that,,for so many reasons. It's so nhard to talk about gender.,We shy away from the word "feminist," na word I really think we need to embrace.,We have to get rid of the nword bossy and bring back --,(Applause),I think I would say in a louder voice, nwe need to get rid of the word "bossy",and bring back the word "feminist," nbecause we need it.,(Applause) 
 PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in. 
 SS: A lot more leaning in. 
 PM: Thank you, Sheryl.,Thanks for leaning in and saying yes. 
 SS: Thank you. 
 (Applause)
